PREFACE

WITH this volume, we begin the Works of St. Chrysostom. It contains a
sketch of his life and labors, the book on the priesthood, the letters to
Theodore, the catechetical instructions, and a selection of ascetic treatises,
special homilies, letters to Olympias and Innocent and the twenty-one
Homilies on the Statues.

The translations are entirely new, or thoroughly revised, by the Rev.
W.R.W. Stephens, whose services I was so fortunate as to secure. He has
written the best biography of St. Chrysostom and is thoroughly at home
in his writings. He has taken the great pains, with the aid of two friends,
the Rev. T. P. Brandram and Rev. R. Blackburn, and is responsible for the
whole volume, with the exception of the Prolegomena, which I wrote
myself, to correspond with the Prolegomena to the works of St. Augustin.

The other volumes of St. Chrysostom in this series will be devoted to his
exegetical Homilies on the greater part of the New Testament.

THE LIFE AND WORK OF

ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM

BY PHILIP SCHAFF

CHAPTER 1.- LITERATURE

1. EDITIONS OF CHRYSOSTOM'S WORKS

S. JOANNIS CHRYSOSTOMI, archiepiscopi Constantinopolitani, Opera
omnia qua exstant vei quae ejus nomine circumferuntur, ad MSS. codices
Gallicosl, Vaticanos, Anglicos, Germanicosque castigata, etc. Opera et
studio D. BERNARDI DE M ONTFAUCON, monachi ordinis S. Benedicti e
congregatione S. Mauri, opem ferentibus aliis ex eodem sodalitio,
monachis. Greek and Latin, Paris 1718-'38, in 13 vols., fol. This is the
best edition, and the result of about twenty years of the patient labor of
Montfaucon (d. Dec. 21, 1741, 86 years old), and several assistants of the
brotherhood of St. Maur. More than three hundred MSS. were made use
of, but the eight principal MSS., as Field has shown, were not very
carefully collated. Montfaucon, who at the date of the completion of his
edition was 83 years old, prepared valuable prefaces to every treatise and
set of homilies, arranged the works in chronological order, and added in
vol. XIII. learned dissertations on the life, doctrine, discipline and heresies
of the age of Chrysostom.

The Benedictine edition was reprinted at Venice, 1734-'41, in 13 vols.
fol.,; at Paris, ed. by F. F. DE SINNER (GAUME), 1834-'39, in 13 vols. (an
elegant edition, with some additions); and, with various improvements and
corrections, by J.P. MIGNE, Petit-Montrouge, 1859-'63, in 13 vols. The
last is the most complete edition, but inferior in paper and type to that of

Gaume. Migne uses the critical text of Field in Matthew and the Pauline
Epp. He had previously edited a Latin version, 1842, in 9 vols.

The edition of Sir HENRY SAVILE (Provost of Eton). Etonae, 1612, in 8
vols. fol., is less complete than the Benedictine editions, but gives a more
correct Greek text (as was shown by F. Dubner from a collation of
manuscripts) and valuable notes. Savile personally examined the libraries
of Europe and spent 8,000 on his edition. His wife was so jealous of his
devotion to Chrysostom that she threatened to burn his manuscripts.

The edition of FRONTON LE DUC, a French Jesuit, and the two brothers,
FREDERICK and CLAUDE M OREL, was published at Paris, 1636, in 12 vols.
fol., Greek and Latin.

A selection of Chrysostom's works (Opera praestantissima) in Greek and
Latin, was edited by T. G. LOMLER, Rudolphopoli (Rudolstadt), 1840
(unfinished).

The best edition of the Greek text of the Homilies on Matthew, and all the
Pauline Epistles is by Dr.FREDERICK FIELD, of the Church of England (d.
1883), in the "Bibiotheca Patrum Ecclesiae Orientalis qui ante Orientis et
Occidentis schisma floruerent." The Homilies on Matthew appeared at
Cambridge, 1839, 3 vols.; the Homilies on the Epistles of Paul and the
Hebrews, Oxford, 1839-'62, in 7 vols.

The treatise De Sacerdotio (peri> ijrwsu>nhv) was separately edited by
ERASMUS in Greek (Basel, 1525, from the press of Frobenius), by J.
HUGHES, in Greek and Latin (Cambridge, 1710), and by J.A. BENGEL, the
commentator, in Greek (Stuttgart, 1725, and repeatedly reprinted since at
Leipzig, 1825, 1834, 1872, by C. Tauchnitz). LOMLER (Chrys. Opera, pp.
viii. and ix.) enumerates twenty-three separate editions and translations of
the treatise on the Priesthood.

2. TRANSLATIONS.-

(A) German Translations.

The treatise on the Priesthood has been translated by HASSELBACH, 1820;
RITTER, 1821, and others. The Bibliothek der Kirchenvater (Rom. Cath.),
published at Kempton in Bavaria, devotes ten small volumes to St.

Chrysostom, including the Priesthood, ascetic Treatises,and Homilies,
translated by JOH. CHRYSOSTOMUS M ITTERRUTZNER, 1869-'84. German
translations of selected Homilies by J.A. CRAMER (Leipzig, 1748-'51, 10
vols.); FEDER (Augsburg, 1786); PH. MAYER (Nurnberg, 1830); W
ARNOLDI (Trier, 1835); AUGUSTI (Predigten der Kirchenvater, vols. I. and
II., Leipzig, 1839); JOS. LUTZ (Tubingen, 2d ed. 1859); GUST. LEONHARDI
(Leipzig, 1888, selected sermons and orations, in vol I. of
Klassikerbibliothek der Christl. Predigtliteratur).

(B) English Translations.

The work on the Priesthood was translated by HOLLIER (London, 1728);
BUNCE (London, 1759); HOHLER (Cambridge, 1837); MARSH (London,
1844); HARRIS COWPER (London, 1866); and STEPHENS (N. York, 1888,
prepared for this "Library").

The Homilies on the Statues and on the New Testament were translated by
several scholars for the "Oxford Library of the Fathers," 1839-'77, 16
vols. The earlier parts (on the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and on the
Statues) are based on the text of Montfaucon and Savile, the later parts on
the improved text of Field. The Oxford translation has been revised and
annotated by American scholars for this "Library," and new translations
of other works of St. Chrysostom have been added, namely, the treatise on
the Priesthood, the Exhortation to the fallen Theodore, Letters, Tracts, and
Special Homilies (in this first volume).

represents Chrysostom as a type of the Johannean tendency among the
Fathers, as distinct from Augustin, the strongest type of the Pauline
tendency. He gives a full account of the opinions and religious life of
Chrysostom, but without a clear picture of his personality. (HASE says:

CHAPTER 2

CHRYSOSTOM'S YOUTH AND TRAINING, A.D. 347-370

"Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to
make our common supplications unto Thee; and doest promise, that when
two or three are gathered together in Thy name Thou wilt grant their
requests: fulfill now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of Thy servants, as
may be most expedient for them; granting us in this world knowledge of
Thy truth, and in the world to come life everlasting, Amen."

This beautiful and comprehensive prayer, which is translated from the
Liturgy of St. Chrysostom, has made his name a household wherever the
Anglican Liturgy is known and used.

JOHN, surnamed CHRYSOSTOM (∆Iwa>nnhv Cruso>stomov) is the greatest
pulpit orator and commentator of the Greek Church, and still deservedly
enjoys the highest honor in the whole Christian world. No one of the
Oriental Fathers has left a more spotless reputation; no one is so much
read and so often quoted by modern preachers and commentators. An
admiring posterity, since the close of the fifth century, has given hin the
surname CHRYSOSTOM (THE GOLDEN M OUTH), which has entirely
superseded his personal name JOHN, and which bests expresses the general
estimate of his merits.

His life may be divided into five periods: (I) His youth and training till his
conversion and baptism, A.D. 347-370. His ascetic and monastic life, 370381. His public life as priest and preacher at Antioch, 381-398. His
episcopate at Constantinople, 398-404. His exile to his death, 404-407.

John (the name by which alone he is known among contemporary writers
and his first biographers) was born in 347,{2} at Antioch, the capital of
Syria, and the home of the mother church of Gentile Christianity, where
the disciples of Jesus were first called "Christians."

His father, Secundas, was a distinguished military officer (magister
militum) in the imperial army of Syria, and died during the infancy of John,
without professing Christianity, as far as we know. His mother, Anthusa,
was a rare woman. Left a widow at the age of twenty, she refused all
offers of marriage, and devoted herself exclusively to the education of her
only son and his older sister. She was probably from principle averse to a
second marriage, according to a prevailing view of the Fathers. She shines,
with Nonna and Monica, among the most pious mothers of the fourth
century, who prove the ennobling influence of Christianity on the
character of woman, and through her on all the family relations. Anthusa
gained general esteem by her exemplary life. The famous advocate of
heathenism, Libanius, on hearing of her consistency and devotion, felt
constrained to exclaim: "Bless me! what wonderful women there are
among the Christians."

She gave her son an admirable education, and early planted in his soul the
germs of piety, which afterwards bore the richest fruits for himself and the
church. By her admonitions and the teachings of the Bible, he was secured
against the seductions of heathenism.

Yet he was not baptized till he had reached the age of maturity. In that age
if transition from heathenism to Christianity, the number of adult
baptisms far exceeded that of infant baptisms. Hence the large baptisteries
for the baptism of crowds of converts; hence catechumens, and their
careful instruction before baptism and admission to the Missa. Fidelium or
the holy communion. Even Christian parents, as the father and mother of
Gregory Nazianzen, the mother of Chrysostom, and the mother of
Augustin, put off the baptism of their offspring, partly no doubt from a
very high conception of baptism as the sacrament of regeneration, and the
superstitious fear that early baptism involved the risk of a forfeiture of
infant baptism, and this was the reason why many professing Christians
put off their baptism till the latest hour; just as now so many from the
same motive delay repentance and conversion to their death-bed.
Chrysostom often rebukes that custom. The Emperor Theodusius the
Great was not baptized till the first year of his reign (380), when attacked
by a serious illness. Chrysostom received his literary training chiefly from
Libanius, the admirer and friend of Julian the Apostate, and the first
classical scholar and rhetorician of his age, who after a long career as public

teach at Athens and Constantinople, returned to his native Antioch and
had the misfortune to outlive the revival of heathenism under Julian and to
lament the triumph of Christianity under his successors. He was
introduced by him into a knowledge of the Greek classics and the arts of
rhetoric, which served him a good purpose for his future labors in the
church. He was his best scholar, and when Libanius, shortly before his
death (about 393), was asked whom he wished for his successor, he
replied: "John, if only the Christinas had not stolen him from us."

After the completion of his studies Chrysostom became a rhetorician, and
began the profitable practice of law, which opened to him a brilliant
political career. The amount of litigation was enormous. The display of
talent in the law-courts was the high-road to the dignities of vice-prefect,
prefect, and consul. Some of his speeches at the bar excited admiration and
were highly commended by Libanius. For some time, as he says, he was "a
never-failing attendant at the courts of law, and passionately fond of the
theater." But he was not satisfied. The temptations of a secular profession
in a corrupt state of society discouraged him. To accept a fee for making
the worse cause appear the better cause, seemed to him to be taking
Satan's wages.

CHAPTER 3

HIS CONVERSION AND ASCETIC LIFE

The quiet study of the Scriptures, the example of his pious mother, the
acquaintance with Bishop Meletius, and the influence of his intimate
freind Basil, who was of the same age and devoted to ascetic life, combined
to produce a gradual change in his character.

He entered the class of catechumens, and after the usual period of three
years of instruction and probation, he was baptized by Meletius in his
twenty-third year (369 or 370). From this time on, says Palladius, "he
nether swore, nor defamed any one, nor spoke falsely, nor cursed, nor
even tolerated facetious jokes." His baptism was, as in the case of St.
Augustin, the turning point in his life, an entire renunciation of this world

and dedication to the service of Christ. The change was radical and
permanent.

Meletius, who foresaw the future greatness of the young lawyer, wished
to secure him for the active service of the church, and ordained him to the
subordinate office of lector (anagnostes, reader), about A.D. 370. The
lectors had to read the Scripture lessons in the first part of divine service
(the "Missa Catechumenorum"), and to call upon the people to pray, but
could not preach nor distrubute the sacraments.

The first inclination of Chrysostom after baptism was to adopt the
monastic life as the safest mode, according to the prevailing notions of the
church in that age, to escape the temptations and corruptions of the world,
to cultivate holiness and to secure the salvation of the soul. But the earnest
entreaties of his mother prevailed on him to delay the gratification of his
desire. He relates the scene with dramatic power. She took him to her
chamber, and by the bed where she had given him birth, she adjured him
with tears not to forsake her. "My son," she said in substance, "my only
comfort in the midst of the miseries of this earthly life is to see thee
constantly, and to behold in thy features the faithful image of my beloved
husband who is no more. This comfort commenced with your infancy
before you could speak. I ask only one favor from you: do not make me a
widow a second time; wait at least till I die; perhaps I shall soon leave this
world. When you have buried me and joined my ashes with those of your
father, nothing will then prevent you from retiring into monastic life. But
as long as I breathe, support me by your presence, and do not draw upon
you the wrath of God by bringing such evils upon me who have given you
no offense."

These tender, simple and impressive words suggest many heart-rending
scenes caused by the ascetic enthusiasm for separation from the sacred ties
of the family. It is honorable to Chrysostom that he yielded to the
reasonable wishes of his devoted mother. He remained at home, but turned
his home into a monastery. He secluded himself from the world and
practiced a rigid asceticism. He ate little and seldom, and only the plainest
food, slept on the bare floor and frequently rose to prayer. He kept almost
unbroken silence to prevent a relapse into the habit of slander.

His former associates at the bar called him unsociable and morose. But two
of his fellow-pupils under Libanius joined him in his ascetic life, Maximus
(afterwards bishop of Seleucia), and Theodore of Mopsuestia. They
studied the Scriptures under the direction of Diodorus (afterwards bishop
of Tarsus), the founder of the Antiochian school of theology, of which
Chrysostom and Theodore became the chief ornaments.

Theodore was warmly attached to a young lady named Hermione, and
resolved to marry and to leave the ascetic brotherhood. This gave rise to
the earliest treatise of Chrysostom-namely, an exhortation to Theodore, in
two letters. He plied all his oratorical arts of sad sympathy, tender
entreaty, bitter reproach, and terrible warning, to reclaim his friend to what
he thought the surest and safest way to heaven. To sin, he says, is human,
but to persist in sin is devilish; to fall is not ruinous to the soul, but to
remain on the ground is. The appeal had its desired effect; Theodore
resumed his monastic life and became afterwards bishop of Mopsuestia in
Cilicia and one of the first biblical scholars. The arguments which
Chrysostom used, would condemn all who broke their monastic vows.
They retain moral force only if we substitute apostasy from faith for
apostasy from monasticism, which must be regarded as a temporary and
abnormal or exceptional form of Christian life.

CHAPTER 4

CHRYSOSTOM EVADES ELECTION TO A BISHOPRIC AND
WRITES HIS WORK ON THE PRIESTHOOD

About this time several bishoprics were vacant in Syria, and frequent
depositions took place with the changing fortunes of orthodoxy and
Arianism, and the interference of the court. The attention of the clergy and
the people turned to Chrysostom and his friend Basil as suitable
candidates for the episcopal office, although they had not the canonical age
of thirty. Chrysostom shrunk from the responsibilities and avoided an
election by a pious fraud. He apparently assented to an agreement with
Basil that both should either accept, or resist the burden of the episcopate,
but instead of that he concealed himself and put forward his friend whom
he accounted much more worthy of the honor. Basil, under the impression

that Chrysostom had already been consecrated, reluctantly submitted to
the election. When he discovered the cheat, he upbraided his friend with
the breach of compact, but Chrysostom laughed and rejoiced at the success
of his plot. This conduct, which every sound Christian conscience must
condemn, caused no offense among the Christians of that age, still less
among the heathen, and was regarded as good management or "economy."
The moral character of the deception was supposed to depend altogether
on the motive, which made it good or bad. Chrysostom appealed in
justification of laudable deception to the stratagems of war, the conduct of
physicians in dealing with refractory patients, to several examples of the
Old Testament (Abraham, Jacob, David) and to the conduct of the
Apostle Paul in circumcising Timothy for the sake of the Jews (Acts 16;3)
and in observing the ceremonial law in Jerusalem at the advice of James
(Acts 21:26).

The Jesuitical maxim, "the end justifies the means," is much older than
Jesuitism, and runs through the whole apocryphal, pseudo-prophetic,
pseudo-apostolic, pseudo-Clementine and pseudo-Isidorian literature of
the early centuries. Several of the best Fathers show a surprising want of a
strict sense of veracity. They introduce a sort of cheat even into their
strange theory of redemption, by supposing that the Devil caused the
crucifixion under the delusion that Christ was a mere man, and thus lost
his claim upon the fallen race. Origen, Chrysostom, and Jerome explain the
offense of the collision between Paul and Peter at Antioch (Galatians 2:11
sqq.) away by turning it into a theatrical and hypocritical farce, which was
shrewdly arranged by the two apostles for the purpose of convincing the
Jewish Christians that circumcision was not necessary. Against such
wretched exegesis the superior moral sense of Augustin rightly protested,
and Jerome changed his view on this particular passage. Here is a point
where the modern standard of ethics is far superior to that of the Fathers,
and more fully accords with the spirit of the New Testament, which
inculcates the strictest veracity as a fundamental virtue.

The escape from the episcopate was the occasion for one of the best and
most popular works of Chrysostom, the Six Books On the Priesthood,
which he wrote probably before his ordination (between 375 and 381), or
during his diaconate (between 381 and 386). It is composed in the form of
a Platonic dialogue between Chrysostom and Basil. He first vindicates by

argument and examples his well-meant but untruthful conduct towards his
friend, and the advantages of timely fraud; and then describes with
youthful fervor and eloquence the importance, duties and trials of the
Christian ministry, without distinguishing between the priestly and the
episcopal office. He elevates it above all other offices. He requires wholesouled consecration to Christ and love to his flock. He points to the
Scriptures (quoting also from the Apocrypha) as the great weapon of the
minister. he assumes, as may be expected, the then prevailing conception
of a real priesthood and sacrifice, baptismal regeneration, the corporal
presence, the virtue of absolution, prayers for the dead, but is silent about
pope and councils, the orders of the clergy, prayers to saints, forms of
prayers, priestly vestments, incense, crosses and other doctrines and
ceremonies of the Greek and Roman churches. He hold up St. Paul as a
model for imitation. The sole subject of the preacher must be to please
God rather than men (Galatians 1;10). "He must not indeed despise
approving demonstrations, but as little must he court them, nor trouble
himself when they are withheld." He should combine the qualities of
dignity and humility, authority and sociability, impartiality and courtesy,
independence and lowliness, strength and gentleness, and keep a single eye
to the glory of Christ and the welfare of the church.

This book is the most useful or at least the best known among the works
of Chrysostom, and is well calculated to inspire a profound sense of the
tremendous responsibilities of the ministry. But it has serious defects,
besides the objectionable justification of pious fraud, and cannot satisfy
the demands of an evangelical minister. In all that pertains to the proper
care of souls it is inferior to the "Reformed Pastor" of Richard Baxter.

CHAPTER 5

CHRYSOSTOM AS A MONK. A.D. 374-381

After the death of his mother, Chrysostom fled from the seductions and
tumults of city life to the monastic solitude of the mountains south of
Antioch, and there spent six happy years in theological study and sacred
meditations and prayer. Monasticism was to him (as to many other
teachers of the church, even to Luther) a profitable school of spiritual

experience and self-government. He embraced this mode of life as "the true
philosophy" from the purest motives, and brought into it intellect and
cultivation enough to make the seclusion available for moral and spiritual
growth.

He gives us a lively description of the bright side of this monastic life. The
monks lived in separate cells or huts (ka>ubai), but according to a common
rule and under the authority of an abbot. They wore course garments of
camel's hair or goat's hair over their linen tunics. They rose before sunrise,
and began the day by singing a hymn or praise and common prayer under
the leadership of the abbot. Then they went to their allotted task, some to
read, others to write, others to manual labor for the support of the poor.
Four hours in each day were devoted to prayer and singing. Their only
food was bread and water, except in case of sickness. They slept on straw
couches, free from care and anxiety. There was no need of bolts and bars.
They held all things in common, and the words of "mine and thine," which
cause innumerable strife in the world, were unknown among the brethren.
If one died, he caused no lamentation, but thanksgiving, and was carried to
the grave midst hymns of praise; for he was not dead, but "perfected," and
permitted to behold the face of Christ. For them to live was Christ, and to
die was gain.

Chrysostom was an admirer of active and useful monasticism, and warns
against the danger of idle contemplation. He shows that the words of our
Lord, "One thing is needful;" "Take not anxious thought for the morrow;"
"Labor not for the meat that perisheth," do not inculcate total abstinence
from work, but only undue anxiety about worldly things, and must be
harmonized with the apostolic exhortation to labor and to do good. He
defends monastic seclusion on account of the prevailing immorality in the
cities, which made it almost impossible to cultivate there a higher Christian
life.

In this period, from 374 to 381, Chrysostom composed his earliest
writings in praise of monasticism and celibacy. The letters "to the fallen
Theodore," have already been mentioned. The three books against the
Opponents of Monasticism were occasioned by a decree of the Emperor
Valens in 373, which aimed at the destruction of that system and
compelled the monks to discharge their duties to the state by military or

civil service. Chrysostom regarded this decree as a sacrilege, and the worst
kind of persecution.

CHAPTER 6

CHRYSOSTOM AS DEACON,
 PRIEST AND PREACHER OF ANTIOCH. A.D. 381-398

By excessive self-mortifications John undermined his health, and returned
to Antioch. There he was immediately ordained deacon by Meletius in 380
or 381, and a few years afterwards presbyter by Flavian (386).

As deacon he had the best opportunity to become acquainted with the
practical needs of the population, the care of the poor and the sick. After
his ordination to the priesthood he preached in the presence of the bishop
his first sermon to a vast crowd. It abounds in flowery Asiatic eloquence,
in humble confession of his own unworthiness, and exaggerated praise of
Meletius and Flavian.

He now entered upon a large field of usefulness, the real work of his life.
The pulpit was his throne, and he adorned it as much as any preacher of
ancient or modern times.

Antioch was one of the great capitals of the Roman empire along with
Alexandria, Constantinople, and Rome. Nature and art combined to make
it a delightful residence, though it was often visited by inundations and
earthquakes. An abundance of pure water from the river Orontes, a large
lake and the surrounding hills, fertile plains, the commerce of the sea,
imposing buildings of Asiatic, Greek, and Roman architecture, rich
gardens, baths, and colonnaded streets, were among its chief attractions. A
broad street of four miles, built by Antiochus Epiphanes, traversed the
city from east to west; the spacious colonnades on either side were paved
with red granite. Innumerable lanterns illuminated the main thoroughfares
at night. The city was supplied with good schools and several churches;
the greatest of them, in which Chrysostom preached, was begun by the
Emporer Constantine and finished by Constantius. The inhabitants were
Syrians, Greeks, Jews, and Romans. The Asiatic element prevailed. The
whole population amounted, as Chrysostom states, to 200,000 of whom

one half were nominally Christians. Heathenism was therefore still
powerful as to numbers, but as a religion it had lost all vitality. This was
shown by the failure of the attempt of the Emporer Julian the Apostate to
revive the sacrifices to the gods. When he endeavored in 362 to restore the
oracle of Apollo Daphneus in the famous cypress grove at Antioch and
arranged for a magnificent procession, with libation, dances, and incense,
he found in the temple one solitary old priest, and this priest ominously
offered in sacrifice-a goose! Julian himself relates this ludicrous farce, and
vents his anger at the Antiochians for squandering the rich incomes of the
temple upon Christianity and worldly amusements.

Chrysostom gives us in his sermons lively pictures of the character of the
people and the condition of the church. The prevailing vices even among
the Christians were avarice, luxury, sensuality, and excessive love of the
circus and the theater. "So great," he says, "is the depravity of the times,
that if a stranger were to compare the precepts of the gospel with the
actual practice of society, he would infer that men were not the disciples,
but the enemies of Christ." Gibbon thus describes the morals of Antioch:
"The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most intemperate
enjoyment of tranquility and opulence, and the lively licentiousness of the
Greeks was blended with the hereditary softness of the Syrians. Fashion
was the only law, pleasure the only pursuit, and the splendor of dress and
furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch. The arts of
luxury were honored, the serious and manly virtues were the subject of
ridicule, and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced
the universal corruption of the capital of the East. The love of spectacles
was the taste, or rather passion of the Syrians; the most skillful artists
were procured from the adjacent cities. A considerable share of the revenue
was devoted to the public amusements, and the magnificence of the games
of the theater and circus was considered as the happiness and as the glory
of Antioch."

The church of Antioch was rent for eighty-five years (330-415) by heresy
and schism. There were three parties and as many rival bishops. The
Meletians, under the lead of Meletius, were the party of moderate
orthodoxy holding the Nicene Creed; the Arians, headed by Eudoxius, and
supported by the Emporer Valens, denied the eternal divinity of Christ;
the Eustathians, under the venerated priest Paulinus, were in communion

with Athanasius, but were accused of Sabellianism, which maintained the
Divine unity and strict deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit, but denied the
tri-personality except in the form of three modes of self-revelation. Pope
Damasus declared for Paulinus and condemned Meletius as a heretic.
Alexandria likewise sided against him. Meletius was more than once
banished from his see, and recalled. He died during the sessions of the
Council of Constantinople, 381, over which he presided for a while. His
remains were carried with great solemnities to Antioch and buried by the
side of Babylas the Martyr. Chrysostom reconciled Flavian, the successor
of Meletius, with Alexandria and Rome in 398. Alexander, the successor of
Flavian, led the Eustathians back into the orthodox church in 415, and thus
unity was restored.

Chrysostom preached Sunday after Sunday and during Lent, sometimes
twice or oftener during the week, even five days in succession, on the
duties and responsibilities of Christians, and fearlessly attacked the
immorality of the city. He declaimed with special severity against the
theater and the chariot-races; and yet many of his hearers would run from
his sermons to the circus to witness these exciting spectacles with the
same eagerness as Jews and Gentiles. He exemplified his preaching by a
blameless life, and soon acquired great reputation and won the love of the
whole congregation. Whenever he preached the church was crowded. He
had to warn his hearers against pickpockets, who found an inviting harvest
in these dense audiences.

A serious disturbance which took place during his career at Antioch, called
forth a remarkable effort of his oratorical powers. The populace of the
city, provoked by excessive taxes, rose in revolt against the Emporer
Theodosius the Great, broke down his statues and those of his deceased
excellent wife Flacilla (d. 385) and his son Arcadius, dragged the fragments
through the streets, and committed other acts of violence. The Emporer
threatened to destroy the whole city. This caused general consternation
and agony, but the city was saved by the intercession of Bishop Flavian,
who in his old age proceeded to Constantinople and secured free pardon
from the Emporer. Although a man of violent temper, Theodosius had
profound reverence for bishops, and on another occasion he submitted to
the rebuke of St. Ambrose for the wholesale massacre of the Thessalonians
(390).

In this period of public anxiety, which lasted several months, Chrysostom
delivered a series of extempore orations, in which he comforted the people
and exhorted them to correct their vices. These are his twenty-one
Homilies on the Statues, so-called from the overthrow of the imperial
statues which gave rise to them. They were preached during Lent 387. In
the same year St. Augustin submitted to baptism at the hands of St.
Ambrose in Milan. One of the results of those sermons was the
conversion of a large number of heathens. Thus the calamity was turned
into a blessing to the church.

During the sixteen or seventeen years of his labors in Antich Chrysostom
wrote the greater part of his Homilies and Commentaries; a consolatory
Epistle to the despondent Stagirius; the excellent book on the martyr
Babylas, which illustrates by a striking example the divine power of
Christianity; a treatise on Virginity, which he puts above marriage; and an
admonition to a young widow on the glory of widowhood, and the duty of
continuing in it. He disapproved of second marriage, not as sinful or illegal,
but as inconsistent with an ideal conception of marriage and a high order of
piety.

CHAPTER 7

CHRYSOSTOM AS PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE.
A.D. 398-404

After the death of Nectarius (successor to Gregory Nazianzen), towards
the end of the year 397, Chrysostom was chosen, entirely without his
own agency and even against his remonstrance, archbishop of
Constantinople. He was hurried away from Antioch by a military escort,
to avoid a commotion in the congregation and to make resistance useless.
He was consecrated Feb. 26, 398, by his enemy Theophilus, patriarch of
Alexandria, who reluctantly yielded to the command of the Emperor
Arcadius or rather his prime minister, the eunuch Eutropius, and nursed
his revenge for a more convenient season.

Constantinople, built by Constantine the Great in 330, on the site of
Byzantium, assumed as the Eastern capital of the Roman Empire the first

position among the episcopal sees of the East, and became the center of
court theology, court intrigues, and theological controversies. The second
oecumenical council, which was held there in 381, under Theodosius the
Great, the last Roman emperor worthy of the name (d.395), decided the
victory of Nicene orthodoxy over the Arian heresy, and gave the bishop of
Constantinople a primacy of honor, next in rank to the bishop of old
Rome - a position which was afterwards confirmed by the Council of
Chalcedon in 451, but disputed by Pope Leo and his successors.

Chrysostom soon gained by his eloquent sermons the admiration of the
people, of the weak Emperor Arcadius, and, at first, even of his wife
Eudoxia, with whom he afterwards waged a deadly war. He extended his
pastoral care to the Goths who were becoming numerous in
Constantinople, had a part of the Bible translated for them, often preached
to them himself through an interpreter, and sent missionaries to the Gothic
and Scythian tribes on the Danube. He continued to direct by
correspondence those missionary operations even during his exile. For a
short time he enjoyed the height of power and popularity.

But he also made enemies by his denunciations of the vices and follies of
the clergy and aristocracy. He emptied the episcopal palace of its costly
plate and furniture and sold it for the benefit of the poor and the hospitals.
He introduced his strict ascetic habits and reduced the luxurious household
of his predecessors to the strictest simplicity. He devoted his large income
to benevolence. He refused invitations to banquets, gave no dinner parties,
and ate the simplest fare in his solitary chamber. He denounced
unsparingly luxurious habits in eating and dressing, and enjoined upon the
much the duty of almsgiving to an extent that tended to increase rather
than diminish the number of beggars who swarmed in the streets and
around the churches and public baths. He disciplined the vicious clergy
and opposed the perilous and immoral habit of unmarried priests of living
under the same roof with "spiritual sisters" (sunei>saktai). This habit
dated from an earlier age, and was a reaction against celibacy. Cyprian had
raised his protest against it, and the Council of Nicea forbade unmarried
priests to live with any females except close relations. Chrysostom's
unpopularity was increased by his irritability and obstinacy, and his
subservience to a proud and violent archdeacon, Serapion. The Empress
Eudoxia was jealous of his influence over Arcadius and angry at his

uncompromising severity against sin and vice. She became the chief
instrument of his downfall.

The occasion was furnished by an unauthorized use of his episcopal
power beyond the lines of his diocese, which was confined to the city. At
the request of the clergy of Ephesus and the neighboring bishops, he
visited the city in January, 401, held a synod and deposed six bishops
convicted of shameful simony. During the absence of several months he
left the episcopate of Constantinople in the hands of Severian, bishop of
Gabala, an unworthy and adroit flatterer, who basely betrayed his trust
and formed a cabal headed by the empress and her licentious court ladies,
for the ruin of Chrysostom. On his return he used unguarded language in
the pulpit, and spoke on Elijah's relation to Jezebel in such a manner that
Eudoxia understood it as a personal insult. The clergy were anxious to get
rid of a bishop who was too severe for their lax morals.

CHAPTER 8

CHRYSOSTOM AND THEOPHILUS.
 HIS FIRST DEPOSITION AND BANISHMENT

At this time Chrysostom became involved in the Origenistic controversies
which are among the most violent and most useless in ancient church
history, and full of personal invective and calumny. The object in dispute
was the orthodoxy of the great Origen, which long after his death was
violently defended and as violently assailed.

Theophilus of Alexandria, an able and vigorous but domineering,
contentious and unscrupulous prelate, was at first an admirer of Origen,
but afterwards in consequence of a personal quarrel joined the opponents,
condemned his memory and banished the Origenistic monks from Egypt.
Some fifty of them, including the four "Tall Brethren," so-called on
account of their extraordinary stature, fled to Constantinople and were
hospitably received by Chrysostom (401). He had no sympathy with the
philosophical speculations of Origen, but appreciated his great merits, and
felt that injustice was done to the persecuted monks He interceded in their

behalf with Theophilus, who replied with indignant remonstrance against
protecting heretics and interfering in another diocese.

Theophilus, long desirous of overthrowing Chrysostom, whom he had
reluctantly consecrated, set every instrument in motion to take revenge.
He sent the octogenarian bishop Epiphanius of Salamis, a well-meaning
and learned but bigoted zealot for orthodoxy, to Constantinople, as a tool
of his hierarchical plans (402); but Epiphanius soon returned and died on
the ship (403). Theophilus now traveled himself to Constantinople,
accompanied by a body-guard of rough sailors and provided with splendid
presents. He held a secret council of thirty-six bishops, all of them
Egyptian except seven, in a suburb of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the
Bosphorus, and procured in this so-called synod at the Oak, the
deposition and banishment of Chrysostom, on false charges of immorality
and high treason (403). Among the twenty-nine charges were these: that
Chrysostom had called the saintly Ephiphanius a fool and a demon, that
he abused the clergy, that he received females without witnesses, that he
ate sumptuously alone and bathed alone, that he had compared the
empress to Jezebel.

The innocent bishop refused to appear before a packed synod of his
enemies, and appealed to a general council. As the sentence of banishment
for life became known, the indignation of the people was immense. A
single word from him would have raised insurrection; but he surrendered
himself freely to the imperial officers, who conveyed him in the dark to
the harbor and put him on board a ship destined for Hieron at the mouth
of the Pontus. Theophilus entered the city in triumph and took vengeance
on Chrysostom's friends.

The people besieged the palace and demanded the restoration of their
bishop. Constantinople was almost in a state of insurrection. The
following night the city was convulsed by an earthquake, which was felt
with peculiar violence in the bedroom of Eudoxia and frightened her into
submission. She implored the emperor to avert the wrath of God by
recalling Chrysostom. Messengers were despatched with abject apologies
to bring him back. A whole fleet of barks put forth to greet him, the
Bosphorus blazed with torches and resounded with songs of rejoicing. On
passing the gates he was borne aloft by the people to the church, seated in

the episcopal chair and forced to make an address. His triumph was
complete, but of short duration. Theophilus felt unsafe in Constantinople
and abruptly sailed in the night for Alexandria.

The feeling with which Chrysostom went into his first and second exile, he
well describes in a letter to Bishop Cyriacus: "When I was driven from the
city, I felt no anxiety, but said to myself: If the empress wishes to banish
me, let her do so; ‘the earth is the Lord's.' If she wants to have me sawn
asunder, I have Isaiah for an example. If she wants me to be drowned in
the ocean, I think of Jonah. If I am to be thrown into the fire, the three
men in the furnace suffered the same. If cast before wild beasts, I
remember Daniel in the lion's den. If she wants me to be stoned, I have
before me Stephen, the first martyr. If she demands my head, let her do so;
John the Baptist shines before me. Naked I came from my mother's
womb, naked I shall leave this world. Paul reminds me, ‘If I still pleased
men, I would not be the servant of Christ.'"

CHAPTER 9

CHRYSOSTOM AND EUDOXIA.
HIS SECOND BANISHMENT, A.D. 403

The restored patriarch and the repentant empress seemed reconciled, and
vied with one another in extravagant laudations for two months, when the
feud broke out afresh and ended in perpetual exile and death.

Eudoxia was a beautiful, imperious, intriguing and revengeful woman, who
despised her husband and indulged her passions. Not content with the
virtual rule of the Roman empire, she aspired to semi-divine honors, which
used to be paid to the heathen Caesars. A column of porphyry with her
silver statue for public adoration was erected in September, 403, on the
forum before the church of St. Sophia, and dedicated amid boisterous and
licentious revelry, which disturbed the sacred services.

Chrysostom ascended the pulpit on the commemoration day of the
martyrdom of John the Baptist, and thundered his righteous indignation
against all who shared in these profane amusements, the people, the
prefect, and the haughty woman on the throne. In the heat of his zeal the

imprudent words are said to have escaped his lips: "Against Herodias is
raging, again she is dancing, again she demands the head of John on a
platter." The comparison of Eudoxia with Herodias, and himself (John)
with John the Baptist was even more directly personal than his former
allusion to the relation of Jezebel and Elijah. Whether he really spoke these
or similar words is at least doubtful, but they were reported to Eudoxia,
who as a woman and an empress could never forgive such an insult. She
demanded from the emperor signal redress. In the conflict of imperial an
episcopal authority the former achieved a physical and temporary, the
latter a moral and enduring victory.

The enemies of Chrysostom flocked like vultures down to their prey.
Theophilus directed the plot from a safe distance. Arcadius was persuaded
to issue an order for the removal of Chrysostom. He continued to preach
and refused to leave the church over which God had placed him, but had to
yield to armed force. He was dragged by imperial guards from the cathedral
on the vigil of the resurrection in 404, while the sacrament of baptism was
being administered to hundreds of catechumens. "The waters of
regeneration," says Palladius, "were stained with blood." The female
candidates, half dressed, were driven by licentious soldiers into the dark
streets. The eucharistic elements were profaned by pagan hands. The
clergy in their priestly robes wer ejected and chased through the city. The
horrors of that night were long afterward remembered with a shudder.
During the greater part of the Easter week the city was kept in a state of
consternation. Private dwellings were invaded, and suspected Joannites -
the partisans of Chrysostom - thrown into prison, scourged and
tortured. Chrysostom, who was shut up in his episcopal palace, twice
narrowly escaped assassination.

At last on June 5, 404, the timid and long hesitating Arcadius signed the
edict of banishment. Chrysostom received it with calm submission, and
after a final prayer in the cathedral with some of his faithful bishops, and a
tender farewell to his beloved Olympias and her attendant deaconesses, he
surrendered himself to the guards and was conveyed at night to the charge
of incendiarism was raised against his friends, but neither threats, nor
torture and mutilation could elicit a confession of guilt. He refused to
acknowledge Arsacius and Atticus as his successors; and this made a crime
punishable with degradation, fine and imprisonment. The clergy who

continued faithful to him were deposed and banished. Pope Innocent of
Rome was appealed to, pronounced the synod which had condemned
Chrysostom irregular, annulled the deposition, and wrote a letter of
sympathy, and urged upon Arcadius the convocation of a general council,
but without effect.

CHAPTER 10

CHRYSOSTOM IN EXILE. HIS DEATH. A.D. 404-407

Chrysostom was conveyed under the scorching heat of July and August
over Galatia and Cappadocia, to the lonely mountain village of Cucusus,
on the borders of Cilicia and Armenia, which the wrath of Eudoxia had
selected for his exile. The climate was inclement and variable, the winter
severe, the place was exposed to Isaurian brigands. He suffered much from
fever and headache, and was more than once brought to the brink of the
grave. Nevertheless the bracing mountain air invigorated his feeble
constitution, and he was hopeful of returning to his diocese. He was
kindly treated by the bishop of Cucusus. He received visits, letters and
presents from faithful friends, and by his correspondence exerted a wider
influence from that solitude than from the episcopal throne.

His 242 extant letters are nearly all from the three years of his exile, and
breathe a noble Christian spirit, in a clear, brilliant and persuasive style.
They exhibit his faithful care for all the interests of the church and look
calmly and hopefully to the glories of heaven. They are addressed to
Eastern and Western bishops, presbyters, deacons, deaconesses, monks
and missionaries; they describe the fatigues of his journey, give advice on a
variety of subjects, strengthen and comfort his distant flock, urge the
destruction of heathen temples in Phoenicia, the extirpation of heresy in
Cyprus, and encourage the missions in Persia and Scythia. Two letters are
addressed to the Roman bishop Innocent I., whose sympathy and
assistance he courted. Seventeen letters - the most important of all - are
addressed to Olympias, the deaconess, a widow of noble birth, personal
beauty and high accomplishments, who devoted her fortune and time to
the poor and the sick. She died between 408 and 420. To her he revealed
his inner life, upon her virtues he lavished extravagant praise, which

offends modern taste as fulsome flattery. For he consolation he wrote a
special treatise on the theme that "No one is really injured except by
himself."

The cruel empress, stung by disappointment at the continued power of
the banished bishop forbade all correspondence and ordered his transfer by
two brutal guards, first to Arabissus, then to Pityus on the Caucasus, the
most inhospitable spots in the empire.

The journey of three months on foot was a slow martyrdom to the feeble
and sickly old man. He did not reach his destination, but ended his
pilgrimage five or six miles from Comana in Pontus in the chapel of the
martyr Basiliscus on the 14th of September, 407, in his sixtieth year, the
tenth of his episcopate. Clothed in his white baptismal robes, he partook
of the eucharist and commended his soul to God. His last words were his
accustomed doxology, the motto of his life: "Glory be to God for all
things, Amen."

He was buried by the side of Basiliscus in the presence of monks and
nuns.

He was revered as a saint by the people. Thirty-one years afterward,
January 27, 438, his body was translated with great pomp to
Constantinople and deposited with the emperors and patriarchs beneath
the altar of the church of the Holy Apostles. The young Emperor
Theodosius II. and his sister Pulcheria met the procession at Chalcedon,
kneeled down before the coffin and in the name of their guilty parents
implored the forgiveness of heaven for the grievous injustice done to the
greatest and saintliest man that ever graced the pulpit and episcopal choirs
of Constantinople. The Eastern church of that age shrunk from the bold
speculations of Origen, but revered the narrow orthodoxy of Epiphanius
and the ascetic piety of Chrysostom.

The personal appearance of the golden-mouthed orator was not imposing,
but dignified and winning. He was of small stature (like David, Paul,
Athanasius, Melanchthon, John Wesley, Schleiermacher). He had an
emaciated frame, a large, bald head, a lofty, wrinkled forehead, deep-set,
bright, piercing eyes, pallid, hollow cheeks, and a short, gray beard.

CHAPTER 11

HIS CHARACTER

Chrysostom was one of those rare men who combine greatness and
goodness, genius and piety, and continue to exercise by their writings and
examples a happy influence upon the Christian church. He was a man for
his time and for all times. But we must look at the spirit rather than the
form of his piety, which bore the stamp of his age.

He took Paul for his model, but had a good deal of the practical spirit of
James, and of the fervor and loveliness of John. The Scriptures were his
daily food, and he again and again recommended their study to laymen as
well as ministers. He was not an ecclesiastical statesman, like St. Ambrose,
not a profound divine like St. Augustin, but a pure man, a practical
Christian, and a king of preachers. "He carried out in his own life, " says
Hase, "as far as mortal man can do it, the ideal of the priesthood which he
once described in youthful enthusiasm." He considered it the duty of
every Christian to promote the spiritual welfare of his fellowmen.
"Nothing can be more chilling," he says in the 20th Homily of Acts, "than
the sight of a Christian who make no effort to save others. Neither
poverty, nor humble station, nor bodily infirmity can exempt men and
women from the obligation of this great duty. To hide our light under
pretense of weakness is as great an insult to God as if we were to say that
He could not make His sun to shine."

It is very much to his praise that in an age of narrow orthodoxy and
doctrinal intolerance he cherished a catholic and irenical spirit. He by no
means disregarded the value of theological soundness, and was in hearty
agreement with the Nicene creed, which triumphed over the Arians during
his ministry in Antioch; he even refused a church in Constantinople which
the Arian Goths claimed. But he took no share in the persecution of
heretics, and even sheltered the Origenistic monks against the violence of
Theophilus of Alexandria. He hated sin more than error, and placed charity
above orthodoxy.

Like all the Nicene Fathers, he was an enthusiast for ascetic and monastic
virtue, which shows itself in seclusion rather than in transformation of the

world and the natural ordinances of God. He retained as priest and bishop
his cloister habits of simplicity, abstemiousness and unworldliness. He
presents the most favorable aspect of that mode of life, which must be
regarded as a wholesome reaction against the hopeless corruption of pagan
society. He thought with St. Paul that he could best serve the Lord in
single life, and no one can deny that he was unreservedly devoted to the
cause of religion.

He was not a man of affairs, and knew little of the world. He had the
harmlessness of the dove without the wisdom of the serpent. He knew
human nature better than individual men. In this respect he resembles
Neander, his best biographer. Besides, he was irritable of temper,
suspicious of his enemies, and easily deceived and misled by such men as
Seratinople. With a little more worldly wisdom and less ascetic severity he
might perhaps have conciliated and converted those whom he repelled by
his pulpit fulminations. Fearless denunciation of immorality and vice in
high places always commands admiration and respect, especially in a
bishop and court preacher who is exposed to the temptations of flattery.
But it is unwise to introduce personalities into the pulpit and does more
harm than good. His relation to Eudoxia reminds one of the attitude of
John Knox to Mary Stuart. The contrast between the pure and holy zeal
of the preacher and the reformer and the ambition and vanity of a woman
on the throne is very striking and must be judged by higher rules than
those of gallantry and courtesy. But after all, the conduct of Christ, the
purest of the pure, towards Mary Magdalene and the woman taken in
adultery is far more sublime.

The conflict of Chrysostom with Eudoxia imparts to his latter life the
interest of a romance, and was over-ruled for his benefit. In his exile his
character shines brighter than even in the pulpit of Antioch and
Constantinople. His character was perfected by suffering. The gentleness,
meekness, patience, endurance and devotion to his friends and his work
which he showed during the last three years of his life are the crowning
glory of his career. Though he did not die a violent death, he deserves to be
numbered among the true martyrs, who are ready for any sacrifice to the
cause of virtue and piety.

CHAPTER 12

THE WRITINGS OF CHRYSOSTOM

Chrysostom was the most fruitful author of among the Greek Fathers.
Suidas makes the extravagant remark that only the omniscient God could
recount all his writings. The best have been preserved and have already
been noticed in chronological order. They may be divided into five classes:

1) Moral and ascetic treatises, including the work on the Priesthood;

2) About six hundred Homilies and Commentaries;

3) Occasional, festal and panegyrical orations;

4) Letters;

5) Liturgy.

His most important and permanently useful works are his Homilies and
Commentaries, which fill eleven of the thirteen folio volumes of the
Benedictine edition. They go together; his homilies are expository, and his
commentaries are homiletical and practical. Continuous expositions,
according to chapter and verse, he wrote only on the first eight chapters of
Isaiah, and on the Epistle to the Galatians. All others are arranged in
sermons with a moral application at the close. Suidas and Cassiodorus
state that he wrote commentaries on the whole Bible. We have from him
Homilies on Genesis, the Psalms, the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of
John, the Acts, the Pauline Epistles including the Hebrews, which he
considered Pauline. Besides, he delivered discourses on separate texts of
Scripture, on church festivals, eulogies on apostles and martyrs, sermons
against the Pagans, against the Jews and Judaizing Christians, against the
Arians, and the famous twenty-one orations on the Statues.

He published some of his sermons himself, but most of them were taken
down by shorthand writers. Written sermons were the exceptions in those
days. The preacher usually was seated, the people were standing.

Of the letters of Chrysostom we have already spoken.

The Liturgy of Chrysostom so-called is an abridgement and improvement
of the Liturgy of St. Basil (d.379), and both are descended from the
Liturgy of James which they superseded. They have undergone gradual
changes. It is impossible to determine the original text, as no two copies
precisely agree. Chrysostom frequently refers to different parts of the
divine service customary in his day, but there is no evidence that the
composed a liturgy, nor is it probable. The Liturgy which bears his name
is still used in orthodox Greek and Russian church on all Sundays, except
those during Lent, and on the eve of Epiphany, Easter and Christmas,
when the Liturgy of Basil takes its place.

CHAPTER 13

HIS THEOLOGY AND EXEGESIS

Chrysostom belonged to the Antiochian school of theology and exegesis
and is its soundest and most popular representative. It was founded by his
teacher Diodor of Tarsus (d. 393), developed by himself and his fellowstudent Theodore of Mopsuestia (d. 429), and followed by Theodoret and
the Syrian and Nestorian divines. Theodore was the exegete, Chrysostom
the homilist, Theodoret the annotator. The school was afterwards
condemned for its alleged connection with the Nestorian heresy; but that
connection was accidental, not necessary. Chrysostom's mind was not
given to dogmatizing, and too well balanced to run into heresy.

The Antiochian school agreed with the Alexandrian school founded by
Origen, in maintaining the divine inspiration and authority of the
Scriptures, but differed from it in the method of interpretation, and in a
sharper distinction between the Old and the New Testaments, and the
divine and human elements in the same.

To Origen belongs the great merit of having opened the path of biblical
science and criticism, but he gave the widest scope to the allegorizing and
mystical method by which the Bible may be made to say anything that is
pious and edifying. Philo of Alexandria had used that method for
introducing the Platonic philosophy into the Mosaic writings. Origen was
likewise a Platonist, but his chief object was to remove all that was

offensive in the literal sense. The allegorical method is imposition rather
than exposition. Christ sanctions parabolic teaching and typical, but not
allegorical, interpretation. Paul uses it once or twice, but only incidentally,
when arguing from the rabbinical standpoint.

The Antiochian school seeks to explain the obvious grammatical and
historical sense, which is rich enough for all purposes of instruction and
edification. It takes out of the Word what is actually in it, instead of
putting into it all sorts of foreign notions and fancies.

Chrysostom recognizes allegorizing in theory, but seldom uses it in
practice, and then more by way of rhetorical ornament and in deference to
custom. He was generally guided by sound common sense and practical
wisdom. He was more free from arbitrary and absurd interpretations than
almost any other patristic commentator. He pays proper attention to the
connection, and puts himself into the psychological state and historical
situation of the writer. In one word, he comes very near to what we now
call the grammatico-historical exegesis. This is the only solid and sound
foundation for any legitimate use of the Scriptures. The sacred writers had
one definite object in view; they wished to convey one particular sense by
the ordinary use of language, and to be clearly understood by their readers.
At the same time the truths of revelation are so deep and so rich they can
be indefinitely expanded and applied to all circumstances and conditions.
Interpretation is one thing, application is another thing. Chrysostom knew
as well as any allegorist how to derive spiritual nourishment from the
Scriptures and to make them "profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be
compete, thoroughly furnished unto every good work." As to the text of
the Greek Testament, he is the chief witness of the SyroConstantinopolitan recension, which was followed by the later Greek with
the Apocrypha, but omits from the New Testament the Apocalypse and
four Catholic Epistles (2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude); at least in the
Synopsis Veteris et novi Testamenti which is found in his works, those five
books are wanting, but this does not prove that he did not know them.

The commentaries of Chrysostom are of unequal merit. We must always
remember that he is a homiletical commentator who aimed at the
conversion and edification of his hearers. He makes frequent digressions

and neglects to explain the difficulties of important texts. Grammatical
remarks are rare, but noteworthy on account of his familiarity with the
Greeks as his mother tongue, though by no means coming up to the
accuracy of a modern expert in philology. In the Old Testament he
depended altogether on the Septuagint, being ignorant of Hebrew,
especially those to the Corinthians, where he had to deal with moral and
pastoral questions. The doctrinal topics of Romans and Galatians were
less to his taste, and it cannot be said that he entered into the depths of
Paul's doctrines of sin and grace, or ascended the height of his conception
of freedom in Christ. His Homilies on Romans are argumentative; his
continuous notes on Galatians somewhat hasty and superficial. The eighty
Homilies on Matthew from his Antiochian period are very valuable.
Thomas Aquinas declared he would rather possess them than be the
master of all Paris. The eighty-eight Homiles on John, also preached at
Antioch, but to a select audience early in the morning, are more doctrinal
and controversial, being directed against the Anomoeans (Arians). We have
no commentaries from him on Mark and Luke, nor on the Catholic
Epistles and the Apocalypse. The fifty-five Homilies on the Acts,
delivered at Constantinople between Easter and Whitsuntide, when
manners and customs of the age, but are the least polished of his
productions. Errasmus, who translated them into Latin, doubted their
genuineness. His life in Constantinople was too much disturbed to leave
him quiet leisure for preparation. The Homilies on the Hebrews, likewise
preached in Constantinople, were published after his death from notes of
his friend, the presbyter Constantine, and the text is in a confused state.

The Homilies of Chrysostom were a rich storehouse for the Greek
commentators, compilers and epitomizers, such as Theodoret,
Oecumenius, Theophylact, and Euthymius Zigabenus, and they are worth
consulting to this day for their exegetical as well as their practical value.

The theology of Chrystom must be gathered chiefly from his
commentaries. He differs from the metaphysical divines of the Nicene age
by his predominantly practical tendency, and in this respect he
approaches the genius of the Western church. He lived between the great
trinitarian and christological controversies and was only involved
incidentally in the subordinate Origenistic controversy, in which he
showed a charitable and liberal spirit. He accepted the Nicene Creed, but

he died before the rise of the Nestorian and Eutychian heresies.
Speculation was not his forte, and as a thinker he is behind Athanasius,
Gregory of Nyssa, and John of Damascus. He was a rhetorician rather
than a logician.

Like all the Greek fathers, he laid great stress on free-will and the cooperation of the human will with divine grace in the work of conversion.
Cassian, the founder of Semi-Pelagianism, was his pupil and appealed to
his authority. Julian of Eclanum, the ablest opponent of Augustin, quoted
Chrysostom against original sin; Augustin tried from several passages to
prove the reverse, but could only show that Chrysostom was no Pelagian.
We may say that in tendency and spirit he was a catholic Semi-Pelagian or
Synergist before Semi-Pelagiansim was brought into a system.

His anthropology forms a wholesome contrast and supplement to the
anthropology of his younger contemporary, the great bishop of Hippo,
the champion of the slavery of the human will and the sovereignty of
divine grace.

We look in vain in Chrysostom's writings for the Augustinian and
Calvinistic doctrines of absolute predestination, total depravity, hereditary
guilt, irresistible grace, perseverance of saints, or for the Lutheran theory
of forensic and solifidian justification. He teaches that God foreordained all
men to holiness and salvation, and that Christ died for all and is both
willing and able to save all, but not against their will and without their free
consent. The vessels of mercy were prepared by God unto glory, the
vessels of wrath were not intended by God, but fitted by their own sin,
for destruction. The will of man, though injured by the Fall, has still the
power to accept or to reject the offer of salvation. It must first obey the
divine call. "When we have begun," he says, in commenting on John 1:38,
"when we have sent our will before, then God gives us abundant
opportunities of salvation." God helps those who help themselves. "When
God," he says, "sees us eagerly prepare for the contest of virtue, he
instantly supplies us with his assistance, lightens our labors and
strengthens the weakness of our nature." Faith and good works are
necessary conditions of justification and salvation, though Christ's merits
alone are the efficient cause. He remarks on John 6:44, that while no man
can come to Christ unless drawn and taught by the Father, there is no

excuse for those who are unwilling to be thus drawn and taught. Yet on the
other hand he fully admits the necessity of divine grace at the very
beginning of every good action. "We can do no good thing at all," he says,
"except we are aided from above." And in his dying hour he gave glory to
God "for all things."

Thus Augustinians and Semi-Pelagians, Calvinists and Arminians, widely
as they differ in theory about human freedom and divine sovereignty, meet
in the common feeling of personal responsibility and absolute dependence
on God. With one voice they disclaim all merit of their own and give all
glory to Him who is the giver of every good and perfect gift and works in
us "both to will and to work, for his good pleasure" (Philippians 2:12).

As to the doctrines which separate the Greek, Roman and Protestant
churches, Chrysostom faithfully represents the Greek Catholic church
prior to the separation from Rome. In addition to the oecumenical
doctrines of the Nicene Creed, he expresses strong views on baptismal
regeneration, the real presence, and the eucharistic sacrifice, yet without a
clearly defined theory, which was the result of later controversies; hence it
would be unjust to press his devotional and rhetorical language into the
service of transubstantiation, or consubstantiation, or the Roman view of
the mass.

His extravagant laudations of saints and martyrs promoted that refined
form of idolatry which in the Nicene age began to take the place of the
heathen hero-worship. But it is all the more remarkable that he furnishes
no support to Mariolatry, which soon after his death triumphed in the
Greek as well as the Latin church. He was far from the idea of the sinless
perfection and immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary. He attributes
her conduct at the wedding of Cana (John 2:3,4) to undue haste, a sort of
unholy ambition for her premature display of the miraculous power of her
Son; and in commenting on Matthew 12:46-49, he charges her and his
brethren with vanity and a carnal mind. He does not use the term
theotokos, which twenty years after his death gave rise to the Nestorian
controversy, and which was endorsed by the third and fourth oecumenical
councils.

As to the question of the papacy he considered the bishop of Rome as the
successor of Peter, the prince of the Apostles, and appealed to him in his

exile against the unjust condemnation of the Council at the Oak. Such
appeals furnished the popes with a welcome opportunity to act as judges
in the controversies of the Eastern church, and greatly strengthened their
claims. But his Epistle to Innocent was addressed also to the bishops of
Milan and Aquilelia, and falls far short of the language of submission to an
infallible authority. He conceded to the pope merely a primacy of honor
(prostasi>a, ajrch>), not a supremacy of jurisdiction. He calls the bishop
of Antioch (Ignatius and Flavian) likewise a successor of Peter, who
labored there according to the express testimony of Paul. In commenting
on Galatians 1:18, he represents Paul as equal in dignity (ijso>timov) to
Peter. He was free from jealousy of Rome, but had he lived during the
violent controversies between the patriarch of new Rome and the pope of
old Rome, it is not doubtful on which side he would have stood.

In one important point Chrysostom approaches the evangelical theology
of the Reformation, his devotion to the Holy Scriptures as the only rule of
faith. "There is no topic on which he dwells more frequently and earnestly
than on the duty of every Christian man and woman to study the Bible;
and what he bade others do, that he did pre-eminently himself." He
deemed the reading of the Bible the best means for the promotion of
Christian life. A Christian without the knowledge of the Scriptures is to
him a workman without tools. Even the sight of the Bible deter from sin,
how much more the reading. It purifies and consecrates the soul, it
introduces it into the holy of holies and brings it into direct communion
with God.

CHAPTER 14

CHRYSOSTOM AS A PREACHER

The crowning merit of Chrysostom is his excellence as a preacher. He is
generally and justly regarded as the greatest pulpit orator of the Greek
church. Nor has he any superior or equal among the Latin Fathers. He
remains to this day a model for preachers in large cities.

He was trained in the school of Demosthenes and Libanius, and owed
much of his literary culture to the classics. He praises "the polish of

Isocrates, the gravity of Demosthenes, the dignity of Thucydides, and the
sublimity of Plato." He assigns to Plato the first rank among the
philosophers, but he places St. Paul far above him, and glories in the
victory of the tent-maker and fishermen over the wisdom of the Greeks.

He was not free from the defects of the degenerate rhetoric of his age,
especially a flowery exuberance of style and fulsome extravagance in
eulogy of dead martyrs and living men. But the defects are overborne by
the virtues: the fullness of Scripture knowledge, the intense earnestness,
the fruitfulness of illustration and application, the variation of topics, the
command of language, the elegance and rhythmic flow of his Greek style,
the dramatic vivacity, the quickness and ingenuity of his turns, and the
magnetism of sympathy with his hearers. He knew how to draw in the
easiest manner spiritual nourishment and lessons of practical wisdom from
the Word of God, and to make it a divine voice of warning and comfort to
every hearer. He was a faithful preacher of truth and righteousness and
fearlessly told the whole duty of man. If he was too severe at times, he
erred on virtue's side. He preached morals rather than dogmas,
Christianity rather than theology, active, practical Christianity that proves
itself in holy living and dying. He was a martyr of the pulpit, for it was
chiefly his faithful preaching that caused his exile. The effect of his oratory
was enhanced by the magnetism of his personality, and is weakened to the
reader of a translation or even the Greek original. The living voice and
glowing manner are far more powerful than the written and printed letter.

Chrysostom attracted large audiences, and among them many who would
rather have gone to the theater than hear any ordinary preacher. He held
them spell-bound to the close. Sometimes they manifested their admiration
by noisy applause, and when he rebuked them for it, they would applaud
his rebuke. "You praise," he would tell them, "what I have said, and
receive my exhortation with tumults of applause; but show your
approbation by obedience; that is the only praise I seek."

The great mediaeval poet assigns to Chrysostom a place in Paradise
between Nathan the prophet and Anselm the theologian, probably
because, like Nathan, he rebuked the sins of the court, and, like Anselm, he
suffered exile for his conviction. The best French pulpit orators -
Bossuet, Massilon, Bourdaloue - have taken him for their model, even in

his faults, the flattery of living persons. Villemain praises him as the
greatest orator who combined all the attributes of eloquence. Hase calls his
eloquence "Asiatic, flowery, full of spirit and of the Holy Spirit, based on
sound exegesis, and with steady application to life." English writers
compare him to Jeremy Taylor. Gibbon (who confesses, however, to have
read very few of his Homilies) attributes to him "the happy art of
engaging the passions in the service of virtue, and of exposing the folly as
well as the turpitude of vice, almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic
representation." Dean Milman describes him as an "unrivaled master in
that rapid and forcible application of incidental occurrences which gives
such life and reality to eloquence. He is at times, in the highest sense,
dramatic in manner." Stephens thus characterizes his sermons:

"A power of exposition which unfolded in lucid order, passage by
passage, the meaning of the book in hand; a rapid transition form clear
exposition, or keen logical argument, to fervid exhortation, or pathetic
appeal, or indignant denunciation; the versatile ease with which he could
lay hold of any little incident of the moment, such as the lighting of the
lamps in the church, and use it to illustrate his discourse; the mixture of
plain common sense, simple boldness, and tender affection, with which he
would strike home to the hearts and consciences of his hearers - all these
are not only general characteristics of the man, but are usually to be found
manifested more or less in the compass of each discourse. It is this rare
union of powers which constitutes his superiority to almost all other
Christian preachers with whom he might be, or has been, compared.
Savonarola had all, and more than all, his fire and vehemence, but
untempered by his sober, calm good sense, and wanting his rational as in
action, but never fanatical. Jeremy Taylor combines, like Chrysostom, real
earnestness of purpose with rhetorical forms of expression and florid
imagery; but, on the whole, his style is far more artificial, and is overlaid
with a miltifarious learning, from which Chrysostom's was entirely free.
Wesley is almost his match in simple, straightforward, practical
exhortation, but does not rise into flights of eloquence like this. The great
French preachers, again, resemble him in his more ornate and declamatory
vein, but they lack that simpler common-sense style of address which
equally distinguished him."

ST. CHRYSOSTOM:

TREATISE CONCERNING
THE CHRISTIAN PRIESTHOOD

TRANSLATED WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY

REV. W.R.W. STEPHENS, M.A.,

Prebendary of Chichester Cathedral,
and Rector of Woolbeding, sussex.

INTRODUCTION TO
THE TREATISE ON THE PRIESTHOOD

THE events recorded in this celebrated treatise on the Priesthood must
have occurred when St. John Chrysostom was about twenty-eight years of
age. His father had died when he was a young child; his mother was a
devout Christian, but had not destined him for the clerical vocation. The
great ability which he showed in early youth seemed to mark him out for
distinction in one of the learned professions, and at the age of eighteen he
began to attend the school of Libanius, the most celebrated sophist of the
day, who had won a great reputation as a professor of philosophy and
rhetoric, and as an eloquent opponent of Christianity, no only in his native
city, Antioch, but also in Athens, Nicomedia, and Constantinople. The
artificial character however of his writings indicates the decadence of
literary power; he could skillfully imitate the style of ancient writers but
he could not inform himself with their spirit; "his productions" says
Gibbon (ch. 24), "are for the most part the vain and idle composition of an
orator who cultivated the science of words."

In the school of Libanius Chrysostom no doubt studied the best classical
Greek authors, and although he retained little admiration for them in later
life and probably read them but rarely, his tenacious memory enabled him
to the last to adorn his homilies with quotations from Homer, Plato and
the Tragedians. In the school of Libanius also he began to practice his
nascent power of eloquence, and a speech which he made in honor of the
Emperors is highly commended in an extant letter of his master Thus the
Pagan sophist helped to forge the weapons which were destined to be
turned against his own cause. When he was on his deathbed being asked by
his friends who was most worthy to succeed him, "it would have been
John" he replied, "if the Christians had not stolen him from us."

In due time Chrysostom began to practice as a lawyer; and as the
profession of the law was reckoned one of the surest avenues to political
distinction for a man of talent, and the speeches of Chrysostom excited
great admiration, a brilliant and prosperous career seemed to lie before him.
But the soul of the young advocate had drunk draughts from a purer well-

spring than the school of Libanius could supply, and like many other
Christians in that age when society, even Christian society, was deeply
tainted by Pagan sentiments and habits of morality of the world in which
he lived, and the standard of holiness which was presented in the Gospel.
The chicanery and rapacity also prevalent in the profession which he had
adopted became especially repugnant to his conscience. And these feelings
were strengthened by the influence of his intimate friend Basil who had
been a fellow pupil with him at the school of Libanius.

The first book of the treatise on the Priesthood opens with a description
of his friendship with Basil; how they studied the same subjects together
under the same teachers, and how when Basil decided to follow what
Chrysostom calls the "true philosophy," by which he means a life of
religious seclusion and study, Chrysostom could not immediately make up
his mind to follow his example. The balance he says was no longer even
between them; the scale of Basil mounted heavenward, while his own was
depressed by the weight of earthly interests, and youthful ambitions. For
a time he continued to practice in the law courts and to frequent the
theater, and other places of amusement. But gradually the study of
Scripture, the longing for renewed intercourse with his friend, and the
influence of Meletius the amiable and saintly Bishop of Antioch so
wrought upon his mind that he resolved to abandon his secular calling.
And in the first place after the usual course of probation he was baptized.
It may seem surprising that he had not been baptized in childhood; but a
corrupt practice of delaying baptism (which Chrysostom himself often
reprobates in his Homilies) was prevalent at that time. It was due in some
persons to a notion that sin before Baptism was comparatively venial, in
others to a dread of binding themselves or their children to the purity of
life which was demanded by the Baptismal vows. In the case of
Chrysostom it is possible, I think, that the distracted condition of the
church in Antioch may have operated as a reason, perhaps the chief reason
for the delay. At the date of his birth (about A.D. 345) and for sixteen
years afterwards the See was occupied by Arian Bishops of the most
wordly time-serving type. The good Catholic Bishop Meletius was
appointed in 361 and it was probably some seven or eight years later that
Chrysostom was baptized by him, and ordained to the office of Reader in
the Church.

There can be no doubt that Baptism, from whatever cause delayed, must
have come home to the recipient at last with all the more solemnity of
meaning. It was often a decisive turning point in the life, the beginning of a
definite renunciation of the world, and dedication of the whole man to
God. To Chrysostom it evidently was this. For a time he became as
enthusiastic ascetic; and then settled down into that more tranquil, but
intense glow of piety which burned with unabate force to the close of his
life. His baptism and the relinquishment of his secular calling are probably
alluded to in the following treatise C. 3. where he speaks of ‘emerging a
little from the flood of worldliness" in which he had been involved. His
friend Basil who received him with open arms does not seem to have
joined any monastic community, but merely to have been living in
retirement and practicing some of the usual monastic austerities. The two
friends now formed a plan for withdrawing together to some quiet retreat,
there to support one another in habits of study, meditation, and prayer. C.
4. The execution of the project was delayed for a time by the passionate
entreaties of Chrysostom's mother that he would not deprive her of his
companionship and protection. C. 5. He must have been a poor companion
however, for we learn (vi. c. 12) that he rarely went outside the house,
maintained an almost perpetual silence, and was constantly absorbed in
study and prayer. He and Basil in fact formed with a few other friends a
voluntary association of youthful ascetics who lived under a strict rule.
We might compare it with the association or club formed by John Wesley
and his brother at Oxford which first earned for them the nickname of
"Methodists." Chrysostom and his friends placed the general regulation of
their studies and religious life under Diodorus and Carterius the presidents
of the two principal monastic communities in the neighborhood of
Antioch. Diodorus was a man of learning and ability, opposed to those
mystical and allegorical interpretations of Holy Scripture which often
disguised rather than elucidated the real meaning of the sacred text, so that
to this training probably we are largely indebted for that clear, sensible
practical method of exposition in which Chrysostom so remarkably excels
nearly all the ancient fathers of the Church.

Not long after the two friends had adopted this course of life, probably
about the year 374, they were agitated by a report that they were likely to
be advanced to the Episcopate (c. 6). By a custom which was then

common in the Church they were liable if elected by the clergy and the
people to be forcibly sized and ordained however unwilling they might be
to accept the dignity [see notes to chapters 6 and 7]. Basil entreated his
friend that in this crisis of their lives they might act as in former times in
concert, and together accept, or evade if possible the expected but
unwelcome honor. Chrysostom affected assent to this proposal, but
secretly resolved to entrap Basil into the sacred office for which he
considered him to be as eminently fitted, as he deemed himself to be
unworthy. The Church should not on account of his own feebleness be
deprived if he could help it, of the able ministrations of such a man as
Basil. Accordingly when some agents of the electing body [as to the
composition of this body, see note 3, p. 21] were sent to seize the two
young men, Chrysostom contrived to hide himself. His language c.6. seems
to imply that he had some intimation of their coming which he purposely
withheld from Basil who consequently was caught. He made at first a
violent resistance, but the officials led him to suppose that Chrysostom
had already submitted, and under this delusion he acquiesced. When he
discovered the trick which had been played upon him he naturally
reproached Chrysostom bitterly for his unkind treachery. But the
conscience of Chrysostom seems to have been quite at ease throughout the
transaction. He regarded it as a pious fraud and when he saw the mingled
distress and anger of his friend he could not refrain, he says, from laughing
aloud for joy, and thanking God for the success of his stratagem. The
remainder of the 1st Book [chs. 8,9] is occupied by Chrysostom's
vindication of his conduct, the principle that deceit for a righteous end is
often salutary and justifiable being maintained with an ingenuity and skill
which bespeaks a man who had recently practiced in the law-courts. His
arguments indeed savor somewhat unpleasantly of casuistry, and it must
be confessed that in his conduct on this occasion there is a tinge of
something like oriental duplicity which is repugnant to our moral sense.
On the other hand it must be borne in mind that neither in the East nor in
the West, for many ages were "pious frauds" absolutely condemned by
the conscience of Christendom; there was always an inclination to judge
each case on its own merits, and to condone if not to approve those in
which the balance of evidence was in favor of a righteous or holy purpose,
and a beneficial result. And it must also be owned, in justice to
Chrysostom, that one of the qualities most conspicuous in him throughout

the whole of his subsequent career is fearless, straightforward honesty
alike in act and in speech; and under the pressure very often of strong
temptation to dissemble and temporize.

The remaining books on the Priesthood treat of the pre-eminent dignity,
and sanctity of the priestly office and the peculiar difficulties and perils
which beset it. They abound with wise and weighty observations
instructive for all times, but they are also interesting from the light which
they throw upon the condition of the Church and of society in the age
when Chrysostom lived. It is to be noted that he is speaking of the
priesthood generally and that it is not always easy to say in any given
passage which of the first two orders in the ministry he has in his mind. In
many instances perhaps he was not thinking of one more than the other.
Where, as was very commonly the case, the jurisdiction of a bishop did
not extend very far beyond the limits of the city in which his See was
placed, his functions would more nearly resemble those which in our day
are discharged by the incumbent of a large town parish than those which
are performed by the modern Bishop of a large diocese. He was the chief
pastor of the people, as well as the overseer of the clergy. Chrysostom's
friend Basil has been confused by some with the great Basil, Bishop of
Caesarea in Cappadocia, who was fifteen years older than Chrysostom, by
others with Basil Bishop of Seleucia, who was many years younger.
Nothing in fact is known about him beyond what is recorded in this
treatise, but he has been conjecturally identified with Basil Bishop of
Raphnea in Syria, not far from Antioch, who attended the Council of
Constantinople in 381.

TREATISE

ON THE PRIESTHOOD

BOOK 1

1. I HAD many genuine and true friends, men who understood the laws of
friendship, and faithfully observed them; but out of this large number there
was one who excelled all the rest in his attachment to me, striving to
outstrip them as much as they themselves outstripped ordinary
acquaintance. He was one of those who were constantly at my side; for we
were engaged in the same studies, and employed the same teachers. We
had the same eagerness and zeal about the studies at which we worked,
and a passionate desire produced by the same circumstances was equally
strong in both of us. For not only when we were attending school, but
after we had left it, when it became necessary to consider what course of
life it would be best for us to adopt, we found ourselves to be of the same
mind.

2. And in addition to these, there were other things also which preserved
and maintained this concord unbroken and secure. For as regarded the
greatness of our fatherland neither had one cause to vaunt himself over the
other, nor was I burdened with riches, and he pinched by poverty, but our
means corresponded as closely as our tastes. Our families also were of
equal rank, and thus everything concurred with our disposition.

3. But when it became our duty to pursue the blessed life of monks, and
the true philosophy, our balance was no longer even, but his scale
mounted high, while I, still entangled in the lusts of this world, dragged
mine down and kept it low, weighting it with those fancies in which
youths are apt to indulge. For the future our friendship indeed remained as
firm as it was before, but our intercourse was interrupted; for it was
impossible for persons who were not interested about the same things to
spend much time together. But as soon as I also began to emerge a little

from the flood of worldliness, he received me with open arms; yet not
even thus could we maintain our former equality: for having got the start
of me in time, and having displayed great earnestness, he rose again above
my level, and soared to a great height.

4. Being a good man, however, and placing a high value on my friendship,
he separated himself from all the rest (of the brethren), and spent the
whole of his time with me, which he had desired to do before, but had been
prevented as I was saying by my frivolity. For it was impossible for a
man who attended the law-courts, and was in a flutter of excitement about
the pleasures of the stage, to be often in the company of one who was
nailed to his books, and never set foot in the market place. Consequently
when the hindrances were removed, and he had brought me into the same
condition of life as himself, he gave free vent to the desire with which he
had long been laboring. He could not bear leaving me even for a moment,
and he persistently urged that we should each of us abandon our own
home and share a common dwelling: - in fact he persuaded me, and the
affair was taken in hand.

5. But the continual lamentations of my mother hindered me from granting
him the favor, or rather from receiving this boon at his hands. For when
she perceived that I was meditating this step, she took me into her own
private chamber, and, sitting near me on the bed where she had given birth
to me, she shed torrents of tears, to which she added words yet more
pitiable than her weeping, in the following lamentable strain: My child, it
was not the will of Heaven that I should long enjoy the benefit of thy
father's virtue. For his death soon followed the pangs which I endured at
thy birth, leaving thee an orphan and me a widow before my time to face
all the horrors of widowhood, which only those who have experienced
them can fairly understand. For no words are adequate to describe the
tempest-tossed condition of a young woman who, having but lately left
her paternal home, and being inexperienced in business, is suddenly racked
by an overwhelming sorrow, and compelled to support a load of care too
great for her age and sex. For she has to correct the laziness of servants,
and to be on the watch for their rogueries, to repel the designs of relations,
to bear bravely the threats of those who collect the public taxes, and
harshness in the imposition of rates. And if the departed one should have
left a child, even if it be a girl, great anxiety will be caused to the mother,

although free from much expense and fear: but a boy fills her with ten
thousand alarms and many anxieties every day, to say nothing of the great
expense which one is compelled to incur if she wishes to bring him up in a
liberal way. None of these things, however, induced me to enter into a
second marriage, or introduce a second husband into thy father's house:
but I held on as I was, in the midst of the storm and uproar, and did not
shun the iron furnace of widowhood. My foremost help indeed was the
grace from above; but it was no small consolation to me under those I
terrible trials to look continually on thy face and to preserve in thee a
living image of him who had gone, an image indeed which was a fairly exact
likeness.

On this account, even when thou wast an infant, and hadst not yet learned
to speak, a time when children are the greatest delight to their parents,
thou didst afford me much comfort. Nor indeed can you complain that,
although I bore my widowhood bravely, I diminished thy patrimony,
which I know has been the fate of many who have had the misfortune to
be orphans. For, besides keeping the whole of it intact, I spared no
expense which was needful to give you an honorable position, spending
for this purpose some of my own fortune, and of my marriage dowry. Yet
do not think that I say these things by way of reproaching you; only in
return for all these benefits I beg one favor: do not plunge me into a second
widowhood; nor revive the grief which is now laid to rest: wait for my
death: it may be in a little while I shall depart. The young indeed look
forward to a distant old age; but we who have grown old have nothing but
death to wait for. When, then, you shall have committed my body to the
ground, and mingled my bones with thy father's, embark for a long
voyage, and set sail on any sea thou wilt: then there will be no one to
hinder thee: but as long as my life lasts, be content to live with me. Do
not, I pray you, oppose God in vain, involving me without cause, who
have done you no wrong, in these great calamities. For if you have any
reason to complain that I drag you into worldly cares, and force you to
attend to business, do not be restrained by any reverence for the laws of
nature, for training or custom, but fly from me as an enemy; but if, on the
contrary, I do everything to provide leisure for thy journey through this
life, let this bond at least if nothing else keep thee by me. For couldst thou
say that ten thousand loved thee, yet no one will afford thee the

enjoyment of so much liberty, seeing there is no one who is equally
anxious for thy welfare.

6. These words, and more, my mother spake to me, and I related them to
that noble youth. But he, so far from being disheartened by these
speeches, was the more urgent in making the same request as before. Now
while we were thus situated, he continually entreating, and I refusing my
assent, we were both of us disturbed by a report suddenly reaching us that
we were about to be advanced to the dignity of the episcopate. As soon as
I heard this rumor I was seized with alarm and perplexity: with alarm lest I
should be made captive against my will, and perplexity, inquiring as I
often did whence any such idea concerning us could have entered the
minds of these men; for looking to myself I found nothing worthy of such
an honor. But that noble youth having come to me privately, and having
conferred with me about these things as if with one who was ignorant of
the rumor, begged that we might in this instance also as formerly shape our
action and our counsels the same way: for he would readily follow me
whichever course I might pursue, whether I attempted flight or submitted
to be captured. Perceiving then his eagerness, and considering that I should
inflict a loss upon the whole body of the Church if, owing to my own
weakness, I were to deprive the flock of Christ of a young man who was
so good and so well qualified for the supervision of large numbers, I
abstained from disclosing to him the purpose which I had formed, although
I had never before allowed any of my plans to be concealed from him. I
now told him that it would be best to postpone our decision concerning
this matter to another season, as it was not immediately pressing, and by
so doing persuaded him to dismiss it from his thoughts, and at the same
time encouraged him to hope that, if such a thing should ever happen to
us, I should be of the same mind with him. But after a short time, when
one who was to ordain us arrived, I kept myself concealed, but Basil,
ignorant of this, was taken away on another pretext, and made to take the
yoke, hoping from the promises which I had made to him that I should
certainly follows or rather supposing that he was following me. For some
of those who were present, seeing that he resented being seized, deceived
him by exclaiming how strange it was that one who was generally reputed
to be the more hot tempered (meaning me), had yielded very mildly to the
judgment of the Fathers, whereas he, who was reckoned a much wiser and

milder kind of man, had shown himself hotheaded and conceited, being
unruly, restive, and contradictory. Having yielded to these remonstrances,
and afterwards having learned that I had escaped capture, he came to me in
deep dejection, sat down near me and tried to speak, but was hindered by
distress of mind and inability to express in words the violence to which he
had been subjected. No sooner had he opened his mouth than he was
prevented from utterance by grief cutting short his words before they
could pass his lips. Seeing, then, his tearful and agitated condition, and
knowing as I did the cause, I laughed for joy, and, seizing his right hand, I
forced a kiss on him, and praised God that my plan had ended so
successfully, as I had always prayed it might. But when he saw that I was
delighted and beaming with joy, and understood that he had been deceived
by me, he was yet more vexed and distressed.

7. And when he had a little recovered from this agitation of mind, he began:
If you have rejected the part allotted to you, and have no further regard for
me (I know not indeed for what cause), you ought at least to consider your
own reputation; but as it is you have opened the mouths of all, and the
world is saying that you have declined this ministry through love of
vainglory, and there is no one who will deliver you from this accusation.
As for me, I cannot bear to go into the market place; there are so many
who come up to me and reproach me every day. For, when they see me
anywhere in the city, all my intimate friends take me aside, and cast the
greater part of the blame upon me. Knowing his intention, they say, for
none of his affairs could be kept secret from you, you should not have
concealed it, but ought to have communicated it to us, and we should have
been at no loss to devise some plan for capturing him. But I am too much
ashamed and abashed to tell them that I did not know you had long been
plotting this trick, lest they should say that our friendship was a mere
pretense. For even if it is so, as indeed it is - nor would you yourself
deny it after what you have done to me - yet it is well to hide our
misfortune from the outside world, and persons who entertain but a
moderate opinion of us. I shrink from telling them the truth, and how
things really stand with us, and I am compelled in future to keep silence,
and look down on the ground, and turn away to avoid those whom I meet.
For if I escape the condemnation on the former charge, I am forced to
undergo judgment for speaking falsehood. For they will never believe me

when I say that you ranged Basil amongst those who are not permitted to
know your secret affairs. Of this, however, I will not take much account,
since it has seemed agreeable to you, but how shall we endure the future
disgrace? for some accuse you of arrogance, others of vainglory: while
those who are our more merciful accusers, lay both these offenses to our
charge, and add that we have insulted those who did us honor, although
had they experienced even greater indignity it would only have served
them right for passing over so many and such distinguished men and
advancing mere youths, who were but yesterday immersed in the interests
of this world, to such a dignity as they never have dreamed of obtaining, in
order that they may for a brief season knit the eyebrows, wear dusky
garments, and put on a grave face. Those who from the dawn of manhood
to extreme old age have diligently practiced self-discipline, are now to be
placed under the government of youths who have not even heard the laws
which should regulate their administration of this office. I am perpetually
assailed by persons who say such things and worse, and am at a loss how
to reply to them; but I pray you tell me: for I do not suppose that you
took to flight and incurred such hatred from such distinguished men
without cause or consideration, but that your decision was made with
reasoning and circumspection: whence also I conjecture that you have
some argument ready for your defense. Tell me, then, whether there is any
fair excuse which I can make to those who accuse us.

For I do not demand any account for the wrongs which I have sustained at
your hands, nor for the deceit or treachery you have practiced, nor for the
advantage which you have derived from me in the past. For I placed my
very life, so to say, in your hands, yet you have treated me with as much
guile as if it had been your business to guard yourself against an enemy.
Yet if you knew this decision of ours to be profitable, you ought not to
have avoided the gain: if on the contrary injurious, you should have saved
me also from the loss, as you always said that you esteemed me before
every one else. But you have done everything to make me fall into the
snare: and you had no need of guile and hypocrisy in dealing with one who
was wont to display the utmost sincerity and candor in speech and action
towards thee. Nevertheless, as I said, I do not now accuse you of any of
these things, or reproach you for the lonely position in which you have
placed me by breaking off those conferences from which we often derived

no small pleasure and profit; but all these things I pass by, and bear in
silence and meekness, not that thou hast acted meekly in transgressing
against me, but because from the day that I cherished thy friendship I laid
it down as a rule for myself, that whatever sorrow you might cause me I
would never force you to the necessity of an apology. For you know
yourself that you have inflicted no small loss on me if at least you
remember what we were always saying ourselves, and the outside world
also said concerning us, that it was a great gain for us to be of one mind
and be guarded by each other's friendship. Every one said, indeed, that our
concord would bring no small advantage to many besides ourselves; I never
perceived, however, so far as I am concerned, how it could be of advantage
to others: but I did say that we should at least derive this benefit from it:
that those who wished to contend with us would find us difficult to
master. And I never ceased reminding you of these things: saying the age is
a cruel one, and designing men are many, genuine love is no more, and the
deadly pest of envy has crept into its place: we walk in the midst of
snares, and on the edge of battlements; those who are ready to rejoice in
our misfortunes, if any should befall us, are many and beset us from many
quarters: whereas there is no one to condole with us, or at least the number
of such may be easily counted. Beware that we do not by separation incur
much ridicule, and damage worse than ridicule. Brother aided by brother is
like a strong city, and well fortified kingdom. Do not dissolve this genuine
intimacy, nor break down the fortress. Such things and more I was
continually saying, not indeed that I ever suspected anything of this kind,
but supposing you to be entirely sound in your relation towards me, I did
it as a superfluous precaution, wishing to preserve in health one who was
already sound; but unwittingly, as it seems, I was administering medicines
to a sick man: and even so I have not been fortunate enough to do any
good, and have gained nothing by my excess of forethought. For having
totally cast away all these considerations, without giving them a thought,
you have turned me adrift like an unballasted vessel on an untried ocean,
taking no heed of those fierce billows which I must encounter. For if it
should ever be my lot to undergo calumny, or mockery, or any other kind
of insult or menace (and such things must frequently occur), to whom shall
I fly for refuge: to whom shall I impart my distress, who will be willing to
succor me and drive back my assailants and put a stop to their assaults?
who will solace me and prepare me to bear the coarse ribaldry which may

yet be in store for me. There is no one since you stand aloof from this
terrible strife, and cannot even hear my cry. Seest thou then what mischief
thou hast wrought? now that thou hast dealt the blow, dost thou perceive
what a deadly wound thou hast inflicted? But let all this pass: for it is
impossible to undo the past, or to find a path through pathless difficulties.
What shall I say to the outside world? what defense shall I make to their
accusations.

8. CHRYSOSTOM: Be of good cheer, I replied, for I am not only ready
to answer for myself in these matters, but I will also endeavor as well as I
am able to render an account of those for which you have not held me
answerable. Indeed, if you wish it, I will make them the starting-point of
my defense. For it would be a strange piece of stupidity on my part if,
thinking only of praise from the outside public, and doing my best to
silence their accusations, I were unable to convince my dearest of all
friends that I am not wronging him, and were to treat him with indifference
greater than the zeal which he has displayed on my behalf, treating me
with such forbearance as even to refrain from accusing me of the wrongs
which he says he has suffered from me, and putting his own interests out
of the question in consideration for mine.

What is the wrong that I have done thee, since I have determined to
embark from this point upon the sea of apology? Is it that I misled you
and concealed my purpose? Yet I did it for the benefit of thyself who wast
deceived, and of those to whom I surrendered you by means of this deceit.
For if the evil of deception is absolute, and it is never right to make use of
it, I am prepared to pay any penalty you please: or rather, as you will
never endure to inflict punishment upon me, I shall subject myself to the
same condemnation which is pronounced by judges on evil-doers when
their accusers have convicted them. But if the thing is not always harmful,
but becomes good or bad according to the intention of those who practice
it, you must desist from complaining of deceit, and prove that it has been
devised against you for a bad purpose; and as long as this proof is wanting
it would only be fair for those who wish to conduct themselves prudently,
not only to abstain from reproaches and accusation, but even to give a
friendly reception to the deceiver. For a well-timed deception, undertaken
with an upright intention, has such advantages, that many persons have
often had to undergo punishment for abstaining from fraud. And if you

investigate the history of generals who have enjoyed the highest reputation
from the earliest ages, you will find that most of their triumphs were
achieved by stratagem, and that such are more highly commended than
those who conquer in open fight. For the latter conduct their campaigns
with greater expenditure of money and men, so that they gain nothing by
the victory, but suffer just as much distress as those who have been
defeated, both in the sacrifice of troops and the exhaustion of funds. But,
besides this, they are not even permitted to enjoy all the glory which
pertains to the victory; for no small part of it is reaped by those who have
fallen, because in spirit they were victorious, their defeat was only a
bodily one: so that had it been possible for them not to fall when they
were wounded, and death had not come and put the finishing stroke to
their labors, there would have been no end of their prowess. But one who
has been able to gain the victory by stratagem involves the enemy in
ridicule as well as disaster. Again, in the other case both sides equally
carry off the honors bestowed upon valor, whereas in this case they do
not equally obtain those which are bestowed on wisdom, but the prize
falls entirely to the victors, and, another point no less important is that
they preserve the joy of the victory for the state unalloyed; for abundance
of resources and multitudes of men are not like mental powers: the former
indeed if continually used in war necessarily become exhausted, and fail
those who possess them, whereas it is the nature of wisdom to increase
the more it is exercised. And not in war only, but also in peace the need of
deceit may be found, not merely in reference to the affairs of the state, but
also in private life, in the dealings of husband with wife and wife with
husband, son with father, friend with friend, and also children with a
parent. For the daughter of Saul would not have been able to rescue her
husband out of Saul's hands' except by deceiving her father. And her
brother, wish-bag to save him whom she had rescued when he was again in
danger, made use of the same weapon as the wife?

BASIL: But none of these cases apply to me: for I am not an enemy, nor
one of those who are striving to injure thee, but quite the contrary. For I
entrusted all my interests to your judgment, and always followed it
whenever you bid me.

CHRYSOSTOM: But, my admirable and excellent Sir, this is the very
reason why I took the precaution of saying that it was a good thing to

employ this kind of deceit, not only in war, and in dealing with enemies,
but also in peace, and in dealing with our dearest friends. For as a proof
that it is beneficial not only to the deceivers, but also to those who are
deceived; if you go to any of the physicians and ask them how they relieve
their patients from disease, they will tell you that they do not depend
upon their professional skill alone, but sometimes conduct the sick to
health by availing themselves of deceit, and blending the assistance which
they derive from it with their art. For when the waywardness of the
patient and the obstinacy of the complaint baffle the counsels of the
physicians, it is then necessary to put on the mask of deceit in order that,
as on the stage, they may be able to hide what really takes place. But, if
you please, I will relate to you one instance of stratagem out of many
which I have heard of being contrived by the sons of the healing art. A man
was once suddenly attacked by a fever of great severity; the burning heat
increased, and the patient rejected the remedies which could have reduced
it and craved for a draught of pure wine, passionately entreating all who
approached to give it him and enable him to satiate this deadly craving - I
say deadly, for if any one had gratified this request he would not only
have exasperated the fever, but also have driven the unhappy man frantic.
Thereupon, professional skill being baffled, and at the end of its resources
and utterly thrown away, stratagem stepped in and displayed its power in
the way which I will now relate. For the physician took an earthen cup
brought straight out of the furnace, and having steeped it in wine, then
drew it out empty, filled it with water, and, having ordered the chamber
where the sick man lay to be darkened with curtains that the light might
not reveal the trick, he gave it him to drink, pretending that it was filled
with undiluted wine. And the man, before he had taken it in his hands,
being deceived by the smell, did not wait to examine what was given him,
but convinced by the odor, and deceived by the darkness, eagerly gulped
down the draught, and being satiated with it immediately shook off the
feeling of suffocation and escaped the imminent peril. Do you see the
advantage of deceit? And if any one were to reckon up all the tricks of
physicians the list would run on to an indefinite length. And not only
those who heal the body but those also who attend [to the diseases of the
soul may be found continually making use of this remedy. Thus the
blessed Paul attracted those multitudes of Jews: with this purpose he
circumcised Timothy, although he warned the Galatians in his letter that

Christ would not profit those who were circumcised. For this cause he
submitted to the law, although he reckoned the righteousness which came
from the law but loss after receiving the faith in Christ. For great is the
value of deceit, provided it be not introduced with a mischievous intention.
In fact action of this kind ought not to be called deceit, but rather a kind of
good management, cleverness and skill, capable of finding out ways where
resources fail, and making up for the defects of the mind. For I would not
call Phinees a murderer, although he slew two human beings with one
stroke: nor yet Elias after the slaughter of the 100 soldiers, and the
captain, and the torrents of blood which he caused to be shed by the
destruction of those who sacrificed to devils. For if we were to concede
this, and to examine the bare deeds in themselves apart from the intention
of the doers, one might if he pleased judge Abraham guilty of child-murder
and accuse his grandson and descendant of wickedness and guile. For the
one got possession of the birthright, and the other transferred the wealth
of the Egyptians to the host of the Israelites. But this is not the case:
away with the audacious thought! For we not only acquit them of blame,
but also admire them because of these things, since even God commended
them for the same. For that man would fairly deserve to be called a
deceiver who made an unrighteous use of the practice, not one who did so
with a salutary purpose. And often it is necessary to deceive, and to do
the greatest benefits by means of this device, whereas he who has gone by
a straight course has done great mischief to the person whom he has not
deceived.

1. THAT it is possible then to make use of deceit for a good purpose, or
rather that in such a case it ought not to be called deceit, but a kind of good
management worthy of all admiration, might be proved at greater length;
but since what has already been said suffices for demonstration, it would
be irksome and tedious to lengthen out my discourse upon the subject.
And now it will remain for you to pave whether I have not employed this
art to your advantage.

BASIL: And what kind of advantage have I derived from this piece of
good management, or wise policy, or whatever you may please to call it,
so as to persuade me that I have not been deceived by you?

CHRYSOSTOM: What advantage, pray, could be greater than to be seen
doing those things which Christ with his own lips declared to be proofs of
love to Himself? For addressing the leader of the apostles He said, "Peter,
lovest thou me?" and when he confessed that he did, the Lord added, "if
thou lovest me tend my sheep." The Master asked the disciple if He was
loved by him, not in order' to get information (how should He who
penetrates the hearts of all men?), but in order to teach us how great an
interest He takes in the superintendence of these sheep. This being plain,
it will likewise be manifest that a great and unspeakable reward will be
reserved for him whose labors are concerned with these sheep, upon which
Christ places such a high value. For when we see any one bestowing care
upon members of our household, or upon our flocks, we count his zeal for
them as a sign of love towards ourselves: yet all these things are to be
bought for money: - with how great a gift then will He requite those who
tend the flock which He purchased, not with money, nor anything of that
kind, but by His own death, giving his own blood as the price of the herd.
Wherefore when the disciple said, "Thou knowest Lord that I love Thee,"
and invoked the beloved one Himself as a witness of his love, the Savior
did not stop there, but added that which was the token of love. For He did
not at that time wish to show how much Peter loved Him, but how much
He Himself loved His own Church, and he desired to teach Peter and all of
us that we also should bestow much zeal upon the same. For why did God
not spare His only-begotten Son, but delivered Him up, although the only

one He had? It was that He might reconcile to Himself those who were
disposed towards Him as enemies, and make them His peculiar people.
For what purpose did He shed His blood? It was that He might win these
sheep which He entrusted to Peter and his successors. Naturally then did
Christ say, "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord
shall make ruler over His household." Again, the words are those of one
who is in doubt, yet the speaker did not utter them in doubt, but just as
He asked Peter whether he loved Him, not from any need to learn the
affection of the disciple, but from a desire to show the exceeding depth of
his own love: so now also when He says, "Who then is the faithful and
wise servant?" he speaks not as being ignorant who is faithful and wise,
but as desiring to set forth the rarity of such a character, and the greatness
of this office. Observe at any rate how great the reward is - "He will
appoint him," he says, "ruler over all his goods."

2. Will you, then, still contend that you were not rightly deceived, when
you are about to superintend the things which belong to God, and are
doing that which when Peter did the Lord said he should be able to surpass
the rest of the apostles, for His words were, "Peter, lovest thou me more
than these?" Yet He might have said to him, "If thou lovest me practice
fasting, sleeping on the ground, and prolonged vigils, defend the wronged,
be as a father to orphans, and supply the place of a husband to their
mother." But as a matter of fact, setting aside all these things, what does
He say? "Tend my sheep." For those things which I have already
mentioned might easily be performed by many even of those who are
under authority, women as well as men; but when one is required to
preside over the Church, and to be entrusted with the care of so many
souls, the whole female sex must retire before the magnitude of the task,
and the majority of men also; and we must bring forward those who to a
large extent surpass all others, and soar as much above them in excellence
of spirit as Saul overtopped the whole Hebrew nation in bodily stature: or
rather far more. For in this case let me not take the height of shoulders as
the standard of inquiry; but let the distinction between the pastor and his
charge be as great as that between rational man and irrational creatures, not
to say even greater, inasmuch as the risk is concerned with things of far
greater importance. He indeed who has lost sheep, either through the
ravages of wolves, or the attacks of robbers, or through murrain, or any

other disaster befalling them, might perhaps obtain some indulgence from
the owner of the flock; and even if the latter should demand satisfaction
the penalty would be only a matter of money: but he who has human
beings entrusted to him, the rational flock of Christ, incurs a penalty in the
first place for the loss of the sheep, which goes beyond material things and
touches his own life: and in the second place he has to carry on a far
greater and more difficult contest. For he has not to contend with wolves,
nor to dread robbers, nor to consider how he may avert pestilence from the
flock. With whom then has he to fight? with whom has he to wrestle?
Listen to the words of St. Paul. "We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness
of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." Do you see the
terrible multitude of enemies, and their fierce squadrons, not steel clad, but
endued with a nature which is of itself an equivalent for a complete suit of
armor. Would you see yet another host, stern and cruel, beleaguering this
flock? This also you shall behold from the same post of observation. For
he who has discoursed to us concerning the others, points out these
enemies also to us, speaking in a certain place on this wise: "The works of
the flesh are manifest, which are these, fornication, adultery, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath,
strife, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults," and many more
besides; for he did not make a complete list, but left us to understand the
rest from these. Moreover, in the case of the shepherd of irrational
creatures, those who wish to destroy the flock, when they see the guardian
take to flight, cease making war upon him, and are contented with the
seizure of the cattle: but in this case, even should they capture the whole
flock, they do not leave the shepherd unmolested, but attack him all the
more, and wax bolder, ceasing not until they have either overthrown him,
or have themselves been vanquished. Again, the afflictions of sheep are
manifest, whether it be famine, or pestilence, or wounds, or whatsoever
else it may be which distresses them, and this might help not a little
towards the relief of those who are oppressed in these ways. And there is
yet another fact greater than this which facilitates release from this kind of
infirmity. And what is that? The shepherds with great authority compel
the sheep to receive the remedy when they do not willingly submit to it.
For it is easy to bind them when cautery or cutting is required, and to keep
them inside the fold for a long time, whenever it is expedient, and to bring

them one kind of food instead of another, and to cut them off from their
supplies of water, and all other things which the shepherds may decide to
be conducive to their health they perform with great ease.

3. But in the case of human infirmities, it is not easy in the first place for a
man to discern them, for no man "knoweth the things of a man, save the
spirit of man which is in him." How then can any one apply the remedy
for the disease of which he does not know the character, often indeed being
unable to understand it even should he happen to sicken with it himself?
And even when it becomes manifest, it causes him yet more trouble: for it
is not possible to doctor all men with the same authority with which the
shepherd treats his sheep. For in this case also it is necessary to bind and
to restrain from food, and to use cautery or the knife: but the reception of
the treatment depends on the will of the patient, not of him who applies
the remedy. For this also was perceived by that wonderful man (St. Paul)
when he said to the Corinthians - "Not for that we have dominion over
your faith, but are helpers of your joy." For Christians above all men are
not permitted forcibly to correct the failings of those who sin. Secular
judges indeed, when they have captured malefactors under the law, show
their authority to be great, and prevent them even against their will from
following their own devices: but in our case the wrong-doer must be made
better, not by force, but by persuasion. For neither has authority of this
kind for the restraint of sinners been given us by law, nor, if it had been
given, should we have any field for the exercise of our power, inasmuch as
God rewards those who abstain from evil by their own choice, not of
necessity. Consequently much skill is required that our patients may be
induced to submit willingly to the treatment prescribed by the physicians,
and not only this, but that they may be grateful also for the cure. For if
any one when he is bound becomes restive (which it is in his power to be),
he makes the mischief worse; and if he should pay no heed to the words
which cut like steel, he inflicts another wound by means of this contempt,
and the intention to heal only becomes the occasion of a worse disorder.
For it is not possible for any one to cure a man by compulsion against his
will.

4. What then is one to do? For if you deal too gently with him who needs
a severe application of the knife, and do not strike deep into one who
requires such treatment, you remove one Dart of the sore but leave the

other: and if on the other hand you make the requisite incision
unsparingly, the patient driven to desperation by his sufferings, will often
fling everything away at once, both the remedy and the bandage, and
throw himself down headlong, "breaking the yoke and bursting the band."
I could tell of many who have run into extreme evils because the due
penalty of their sins was exacted. For we ought not, in applying
punishment, merely to proportion it to the scale of the offense, but rather
to keep in view the disposition of the sinner, lest whilst wishing to mend
what is torn, you make the rent worse, and in your zealous endeavors to
restore what is fallen, you make the ruin greater. For weak and careless
characters, addicted for the most part to the pleasures of the world, and
having occasion to be proud on account of birth and position, may yet, if
gently and gradually brought to repent of their errors, be delivered,
partially at least, if not perfectly, from the evils by which they are
possessed: but if any one were to inflict the discipline all at once, he
would deprive them of this slight chance of amendment. For when once
the soul has been forced to put off shame it lapses into a callous condition,
and neither yields to kindly words nor bends to threats, nor is susceptible
of gratitude, but becomes far worse than that city which the prophet
reproached, saying, "thou hadst the face of a harlot, refusing to be
ashamed before all men." Therefore the pastor has need of much
discretion, and of a myriad eyes to observe on every side the habit of the
soul. For as many are uplifted to pride, and then sink into despair of their
salvation, from inability to endure severe remedies, so are there some, who
from paying no penalty equivalent to their sins, fall into negligence, and
become far worse, and are impelled to greater sins. It behooves the priest
therefore to leave none of these things unexamined, but, after a thorough
inquiry into all of them, to apply such remedies as he has appositely to
each case, lest his zeal prove to be in vain. And not in this matter only, but
also in the work of knitting together the severed members of the Church,
one can see that he has much to do. For the pastor of sheep has his flock
following him, wherever he may lead them: and if any should stray out of
the straight path, and, deserting the good pasture, feed in unproductive or
rugged place, a loud shout suffices to collect them and bring back to the
fold those who have been parted from it: but if a human being wanders
away from the right faith, great exertion, perseverance and patience tare
required; for he cannot be dragged back by force, nor constrained by fear,

but must be led back by persuasion to the truth from which be originally
swerved. The pastor therefore ought to be of a noble spirit, so as not to
despond, or to despair of the salvation of wanderers from the fold, but
continually to reason with himself and say, "Peradventure God will give
them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and that they may
recover themselves out of the snare of the devil." Therefore the Lord,
when addressing His disciples, said, "Who then is the faithful and wise
servant?" For he indeed who disciplines himself compasses only his own
advantage, but the benefit of the pastoral function extends to the whole
people. And one who dispenses money to the needy, or otherwise succors
the oppressed, benefits his neighbors to some extent, but so much less
than the priest in proportion as the body is inferior to the soul. Rightly
therefore did the Lord say that zeal for the flock was a token of love for
Himself.

BASIL: But thou thyself - dost thou not love Christ?

CHRYSOSTOM: Yea, I love Him, and shall never cease loving Him; but
I fear lest I should provoke Him whom I love.

BASIL: But what riddle can there be more obscure than this - Christ has
commanded him who loves Him to tend His sheep, and yet you say that
you decline to tend them because you love Him who gave this command?

CHRYSOSTOM: My saying is no riddle, but very intelligible and
simple, for if I were well qualified to administer this office, as Christ
desired it, and then shunned it, my remark might be open to doubt, but
since the infirmity of my spirit renders me useless for this ministry, why
does my saying deserve to be called in question? For I fear lest if I took
the flock in hand when it was in good condition and well nourished, and
then wasted it through my unskilfulness, I should provoke against myself
the God who so loved the flock as to give Himself up for their salvation
and ransom.

BASIL: You speak in jest: for if you were in earnest I know not how you
would have proved me to be justly grieved otherwise than by means of
these very words whereby you have endeavored to dispel my dejection. I
knew indeed before that you had deceived and betrayed me, but much
more now, when you have undertaken to clear yourself of my accusations,

do I plainly perceive and understand the extent of the evils into which you
have led me. For if you withdrew yourself from this ministry because you
were conscious that your spirit was not equal to the burden of the task, I
ought to have been rescued from it before you, even if I had chanced to
have a great desire for it, to say nothing of having confided to you the
entire decision of these matters: but as it is, you have looked solely to
your own interest and neglected mine. Would indeed you had entirely
neglected them; then I should have been well content: but you plotted to
facilitate my capture by those who wished to seize me. For you cannot
take shelter in the argument that public opinion deceived you and induced
you to imagine great and wonderful things concerning me. For I was none
of your wonderful and distinguished men, nor, had this been the case,
ought you to have preferred public opinion to truth. For if I had never
permitted you to enjoy my society, you might have seemed to have a
reasonable pretext for being guided in your vote by public report; but if
there is no one who has such thorough knowledge of my affairs, if you are
acquainted with my character better than my parents and those who
brought me up, what argument can you employ which will be convincing
enough to persuade your hearers that you did not purposely thrust me
into this danger: say, what answer shall I make to your accusers?

CHRYSOSTOM: Nay! I will not proceed to those questions until I have
resolved such as concern yourself alone, if you were to ask me ten
thousand times to dispose of these charges. You said indeed that ignorance
would bring me forgiveness, and that I should have been free from all
accusation if I had brought you into your present position not knowing
anything about you, but that as I did not betray you in ignorance, but was
intimately acquainted with your affairs, I was deprived of all reasonable
pretext and excuse. But I say precisely the reverse: for in such matters
there is need of careful scrutiny, and he who is going to present any one as
qualified for the priesthood ought not to be content with public report
only, but should also himself, above all and before all, investigate the
man's character. For when the blessed Paul says, "He must also have a
good report of them which are without," he does not dispense with an
exact and rigorous inquiry, nor does he assign to such testimony
precedence over the scrutiny required in such cases. For after much
previous discourse, he mentioned this additional testimony, proving that

one must not be contented with it alone for elections of this kind, but take
it into consideration along with the rest. For public report often speaks
false; but when careful investigation precedes, no further danger need be
apprehended from it. On this account, after the other kinds of evidence he
places that which comes from those who are without. For he did not
simply say, "he must have a good report," but added the words, "from
them which are without," wishing to show that before the report of those
without he must be carefully examined. Inasmuch, then, as I myself knew
your affairs better than your parents, as you also yourself acknowledged, I
might deserve to be released from all blame.

BASIL: Nay this is the very reason why you could not escape, if any one
chose to indite you. Do you not remember hearing from me, and often
learning from my actual conduct, the feebleness of my character? Were
you not perpetually taunting me for my pusillanimity, because I was so
easily dejected by ordinary cares?

5. CHRYSOSTOM: I do indeed remember often hearing such things said
by you; I would not deny it. But if I ever taunted you, I did it in sport and
not in serious truth. However, I do not now dispute about these matters,
and I claim the same degree of forbearance from you while I wish to make
mention of some of the good qualities which you possess. For if you
attempt to convict me of saying what is untrue, I shall not spare you, but
shall drove that you say these things rather by way of self - depreciation
than with a view to truth, and I will employ no evidence but your own
words and deeds to demonstrate the truth of my assertion. And now the
first question I wish to ask of you is this: do you know how great the
power of love is? For omitting all the miracles which were to be wrought
by the apostles, Christ said, "Hereby shall men know that ye are my
disciples if ye love one another," and Paul said that it was the fulfilling of
the law, and that in default of it no spiritual gift had any profit. Well, this
choice good, the distinguishing mark of Christ's disciples, the gift which is
higher than all other gifts, I perceived to be deeply implanted in your soul,
and teeming with much fruit.

BASIL: I acknowledge indeed that the matter is one of deep concern to
me, and that I endeavor most earnestly to keep this commandment, but
that I have not even half succeeded in so doing, even you yourself would

bear me witness if you would leave off talking out of partiality, and
simply respect the truth.

6. CHRYSOSTOM: Well, then, I shall betake myself to my evidences,
and shall now do what I threatened, proving that you wish to disparage
yourself rather than to speak the truth. But I will mention a fact which has
only just occurred, that no one may suspect me of attempting to obscure
the truth by the great lapse of time in relating events long past, as oblivion
would then prevent any objection being made to the things which I might
say with a view to gratification. For when one of our intimate friends,
having been falsely accused of insult and folly, was in extreme peril, you
then flung yourself into the midst of the danger, although you were not
summoned by any one, or appealed to by the person who was about to be
involved in danger. Such was the fact: but that I may convict you out of
your own mouth, I will remind you of the words you uttered: for when
some did not approve of this zeal, while others commended and admired
it, "How can I help myself?" you said to those who accused you, "for I do
not know how otherwise to love than by giving up my life when it is
necessary to save any of my friends who is in danger:" thus repeating, in
different words, indeed, but with the same meaning, what Christ said to
his disciples when he laid down the definition of perfect love. "Greater
love," He said, "hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his
friends." If then it is impossible to find greater love than this, you have
attained its limit, and both by your deeds and words have crowned the
summit. This is why I betrayed you, this is why I contrived that plot. Do
I now convince you that it was not from any malicious intent, nor from
any desire to thrust you into danger, but from a persuasion of your future
usefulness that I dragged you into this course?

BASIL: Do you then suppose that love is sufficient for the correction of
one's fellowmen?

CHRYSOSTOM: Certainly it would contribute in a great measure to this
end. But if you wish me to produce evidence of your practical wisdom
also, I will proceed to, do so, and will prove that your understanding
exceeds your loving-kindness.

At these remarks he blushed scarlet and said, "Let my character be now
dismissed: for it was not about this that I originally demanded an

explanation; but if you have any just answer to make to those who are
without, I would gladly hear what you have to say. Wherefore, abandoning
this vain contest, tell me what defense I shall make, both to those who
have honored you and to those who are distressed on their account,
considering them to be insulted.

7. CHRYSOSTOM: This is just the point to which I am finally
hastening, for as my explanation to you has been completed I shall easily
turn to this part of my defense. What then is the accusation made by these
persons, and what are their charges? They say that they have been
insulted and grievously wronged by me because I have not accepted the
honor which they wished to confer upon me. Now in the first place I say
that no account should be taken of the insult shown to men, seeing that by
paying honor to them I should be compelled to offend God. And I should
say to those who are displeased that it is not safe to take offense at these
things, but does them much harm. For I think that those who stay
themselves on God and look to Him alone, ought to be so religiously
disposed as not to account such a thing an insult, even if they happened to
be a thousand times dishonored. But that I have not gone so far as even to
think of daring anything of this kind is manifest from what I am about to
say. For if indeed I had been induced by arrogance and vainglory, as you
have often said some slanderously affirm, to assent to my accusers, I
should have been one of the most iniquitous: of mankind, having treated
great and excellent men, my benefactors moreover, with contempt. For if
men ought to be punished for wronging those who have never wronged
them, how ought we to honor those who have spontaneously preferred to
honor us? For no one could possibly say that they were requiting me for
any benefits small or great which they had received at my hands. How
great a punishment then would one deserve if one requited them in the
contrary manner. But if such a thing never entered my mind, and I declined
the heavy burden with quite a different intention, why do they refuse to
pardon me (even if they do not consent to approve), but accuse me of
having selfishly spared my own soul? For so far from having insulted the
men in question I should say that I had even honored them by my refusal.

And do not be surprised at the paradoxical nature of my remark, for I shall
supply a speedy solution of it.

8. For had I accepted the office, I do not say all men, but those who take
pleasure in speaking evil, might have suspected and said many things
concerning myself who had been elected and concerning them, the electors:
for instance, that they regarded wealth, and admired splendor of rank; or
had been induced by flattery to promote me to this honor: indeed I cannot
say whether some one might not have suspected that they were bribed by
money. Moreover, they would have said, "Christ called fishermen,
tentmakers, and publicans to this dignity whereas these men reject those
who support themselves by daily labor: but if there be any one who
devotes himself to secular learning, and is brought up in idleness, him they
receive and admire. For why, pray, have they passed by men who have
undergone innumerable toils in the service of the Church, and suddenly
dragged into this dignity one who has never experienced any labors of this
kind, but has spent all his youth in the vain study of secular learning."
These things and more they might have said had I accepted the office: but
not so now. For every pretext for maligning is now cut away from them,
and they can neither accuse me of flattery, nor the others of receiving
bribes, unless some choose to act like mere madmen. For how could one
who used flattery and expended money in order to obtain the dignity, have
abandoned it to others when he might have obtained it? For this would be
just as if a man who had bestowed much labor upon the ground in order
that the corn field might be laden with abundant produce, and the presses
overflow with wine, after innumerable toils and great expenditure of
money were to surrender the fruits to others just when it was time to reap
his corn and gather in his vintage. Do you see that although what was said
might be far from the truth, nevertheless those who wished to calumniate
the electors would then have had a pretext for alleging that the choice was
made without fair judgment and consideration. But as it is I have
prevented them from being open mouthed, or even uttering a single word
on the subject. Such then and more would have been their remarks at the
outset. But after undertaking the ministry I should not have been able day
by day to defend myself against accusers, even if I had done everything
faultlessly, to say nothing of the many mistakes which I must have made
owing to my youth and inexperience. But now I have saved the electors
from this kind of accusation also, whereas in the other case I should have
involved them in innumerable reproaches. For what would not the world
have said? "They have committed affairs of such vast interest and

importance to thoughtless youths, they have defiled the flock of God, and
Christian affairs have become a jest and a laughingstock." But now "all
iniquity shall stop her mouth." For although they may say these things on
your account, you will speedily teach them by your acts that
understanding is not to be estimated by age, and the gray head is not to be
the test of an elder - that the young man ought not to be absolutely
excluded from the ministry, but only the novice: and the difference
between the two is great.

BOOK 3

1. CHRYSOSTOM: As regards the insult to those who have done me
honor, what I have already said might be sufficient to prove that in
avoiding this office I had no desire to put them to shame; but I will now
endeavor to make it evident, to the best of my ability, that I was not
puffed up by arrogance of any kind. For if the choice of a generalship or a
kingdom had been submitted to me, and I had then formed this resolution,
any one might naturally have suspected me of this fault, or rather I should
have been found guilty by all men, not of arrogance, but of senseless folly.
But when the priesthood is offered to me, which exceeds a kingdom as
much as the spirit differs from the flesh, will any one dare to accuse me of
disdain? And is it not preposterous to charge with folly those who reject
small things, but when any do this in matters of preeminent importance, to
exempt such persons from accusations of mental derangement, and yet
subject them to the charge of pride? It is just as if one were to accuse, not
of pride, but of insanity, a man who looked with contempt on a herd of
oxen and refused to be a herdsman, and yet were to say that a man who
declined the empire of the world, and the command of all the armies of the
earth, was not mad, but inflated with pride. But this assuredly is not the
case; and they who say such things do not injure me more than they injure
themselves. For merely to imagine it possible for human nature to despise
this dignity is an evidence against those who bring this charge of the
estimate which they have formed of the office. For if they did not consider
it to be an ordinary thing of no great account, such a suspicion as this
would never have entered their heads. For why is it that no one has ever
dared to entertain such a suspicion with reference to the dignity of the
angels, and to say that arrogance is the reason why human nature would
not aspire to the rank of the angelic nature? It is because we imagine great
things concerning those powers, and this does not suffer us to believe that
a man can conceive anything greater than that honor. Wherefore one might
with more justice indite those persons of arrogance who accuse me of it.
For they would never have suspected this of others if they had not
previously depreciated the matter as being of no account. But if they say
that I have done this with a view to glory, they will be convicted of
fighting openly against themselves and falling into their own snare; for I do

not know what kind of arguments they could have sought in preference to
these if they had wished to release me from the charge of vainglory.

2. For if this desire had ever entered my mind, I ought to have accepted the
office rather than avoided it. Why? because it would have brought me
much glory. For the fact that one of my age, who had so recently
abandoned secular pursuits, should suddenly be deemed by all worthy of
such admiration as to be advanced to honor before those who have spent
all their life in labors of this kind, and to obtain more votes than all of
them, might have persuaded all men to anticipate great and marvelous
things of me. But, as it is, the greater part of the Church does not know me
even by name: so that even my refusal of the office will not be manifest to
all, but only to a few, and I am not sure that all even of these know it for
certain; but probably many of them either imagine that I was not elected at
all, or that I was rejected after the election, being considered unsuitable,
not that I avoided the office of my own accord.

3. BASIL: But those who do know the truth will be surprised.

CHRYSOSTOM: And lo! these are they who, according to you, falsely
accuse me of vainglory: and pride. Whence then am I to hope for praise?
From the many? They do not know the actual fact. From the few? Here
again the matter is perverted to my disadvantage. For the only reason why
you have come here now is to learn what answer ought to be given to them
And what shall I now certainly say on account of these things? For wait a
little, and you will clearly perceive that even if all know the truth they
ought not to condemn me for pride and love of glory. And in addition to
this there is another consideration: that not only those who make this
venture, if there be any such (which for my part I do not believe), but also
those who suspect it of others, will be involved in no small danger.

4. For the priestly office is indeed discharged on earth, but it ranks
amongst heavenly ordinances; and very naturally so: for neither man, nor
angel, nor archangel, nor any other created power, but the Paraclete
Himself, instituted this vocation, and persuaded men while still abiding in
the flesh to represent the ministry of angels. Wherefore the consecrated
priest ought to be as pure as if he were standing in the heavens themselves
in the midst of those powers. Fearful, indeed, and of most awful import,
were the things which were used before the dispensation of grace, as the

bells, the pomegranates, the stones on the breastplate and on the ephod,
the girdle, the miter, the long robe, the plate of gold, the holy of holies, the
deep silence within. But if any one should examine the things which belong
to the dispensation of grace, he will find that, small as they are, yet are
they fearful and full of awe, and that what was spoken concerning the law
is true in this case also, that "what has been made glorious hath no glory in
this respect by reason of the glory which excelleth." For when thou seest
the Lord sacrificed, and laid upon the altar, and the priest standing and
praying over the victim, and all the worshippers empurpled with that
precious blood, canst thou then think that thou art still amongst men, and
standing upon the earth? Art thou not, on the contrary, straightway
translated to Heaven, and casting out every carnal thought from the soul,
dost thou not with disembodied spirit and pure reason contemplate the
things which are in Heaven? Oh! what a marvel! what love of God to man!
He who sitteth on high with the Father is at that hour held in the hands of
all, and gives Himself to those who are willing to embrace and grasp Him.
And this all do through the eyes of faith! Do these things seem to you fit
to be despised, or such as to make it possible for any one to be uplifted
against them?

Would you also learn from another miracle the exceeding sanctity of this
office? Picture Elijah and the vast multitude standing around him, and the
sacrifice laid upon the altar of stones, and all the rest of the people hushed
into a deep silence while the prophet alone offers up prayer: then the
sudden rush of fire from Heaven upon the sacrifice: - these are marvelous
things, charged with terror. Now then pass from this scene to the rites
which are celebrated in the present day; they are not only marvelous to
behold, but transcendent in terror. There stands the priest, not bringing
down fire from Heaven, but the Holy Spirit: and he makes prolonged
supplication, not that some flame sent down from on high may consume
the offerings, but that grace descending on the sacrifice may thereby
enlighten the souls of all, and render them more refulgent than silver
purified by fire. Who can despise this most awful mystery, unless he is
stark mad and senseless? Or do you not know that no human soul could
have endured that fire in the sacrifice, but all would have been utterly
consumed, had not the assistance of God's grace been great.

5. For if any one will consider how great a thing it is for one, being a man,
and compassed with flesh and blood, to be enabled to draw nigh to that
blessed and pure nature, he will then clearly see what great honor the grace
of the Spirit has vouchsafed to priests; since by their agency these rites are
celebrated, and others nowise inferior to these both in respect of our
dignity and our salvation. For they who inhabit the earth and make their
abode there are entrusted with the administration of things which are in
Heaven, and have received an authority which God has not given to angels
or archangels. For it has not been said to them, "Whatsoever ye shall bind
on earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth
shall be loosed in Heaven." They who rule on earth have indeed authority
to bind, but only the body: whereas this binding lays hold of the soul and
penetrates the heavens; and what priests do here below God ratifies above,
and the Master confirms the sentence of his servants. For indeed what is it
but all manner of heavenly authority which He has given them when He
says, "Whose sins ye remit they are remitted, and whose sins ye retain
they are retained?" What authority could be greater than this? "The Father
hath committed all judgment to the Son?" But I see it all put into the hands
of these men by the Son. For they have been conducted to this dignity as
if they were already translated to Heaven, and had transcended human
nature, and were released from the passions to which we are liable.
Moreover, if a king should bestow this honor upon any of his subjects,
authorizing him to cast into prison whom he pleased and to release them
again, he becomes an object of envy and respect to all men; but he who has
received from God an authority as much greater as heaven is more precious
than earth, and souls more precious than bodies, seems to some to have
received so small an honor that they are actually able to imagine that one
of those who have been entrusted with these things will despise the gift.
Away with such madness! For transparent madness it is to despise so
great a dignity, without which it is not possible to obtain either our own
salvation, or the good things which have been promised to us. For if no
one can enter into the kingdom of Heaven except he be regenerate through
water and the Spirit, and he who does not eat the flesh of the Lord and
drink His blood is excluded from eternal life, and if all these things are
accomplished only by means of those holy hands, I mean the hands of the
priest, how will any one, without these, be able to escape the fire of hell,
or to win those crowns which are reserved for the victorious?

6. These verily are they who are entrusted with the pangs of spiritual
travail and the birth which comes through baptism: by their means we put
on Christ, and are buried with the Son of God, and become members of
that blessed Head. Wherefore they might not only be more justly feared
by us than rulers and kings, but also be more honored than parents; since
these begat us of blood and the will of the flesh, but the others are the
authors of our birth from God, even that blessed regeneration which is the
true freedom and the sonship according to grace. The Jewish priests had
authority to release the body from leprosy, or, rather, not to release it but
only to examine those who were already released, and you know how
much the office of priest was contended for at that time. But our priests
have received authority to deal, not with bodily leprosy, but spiritual
uncleanness - not to pronounce it removed after examination, but
actually and absolutely to take it away. Wherefore they who despise these
priests would be far more accursed than Dathan and his company, and
deserve more severe punishment. For the latter, although they laid claim to
the dignity which did not belong to them, nevertheless had an excellent
opinion concerning it, and this they evinced by the great eagerness with
which they pursued it; but these men, when the office has been better
regulated, and has received so great a development, have displayed an
audacity which exceeds that of the others, although manifested in a
contrary way. For there is not an equal amount of contempt involved in
aiming at an honor which does not pertain to one, and in despising such
great advantages, but the latter exceeds the former as much as scorn differs
from admiration. What soul then is so sordid as to despise such great
advantages? None whatever, I should say, unless it were one subject to
some demoniacal impulse. For I return once more to the point from which
I started: not in the way of chastising only, but also in the way of
benefiting, God has bestowed a power on priests greater than that of our
natural parents. The two indeed differ as much as the present and the
future life. For our natural parents generate us unto this life only, but the
others unto that which is to come. And the former would not be able to
avert death from their offspring, or to repel the assaults of disease; but
these others have often saved a sick soul, or one which was on the point of
perishing, procuring for some a milder chastisement, and preventing others
from falling altogether, not only by instruction and admonition, but also
by the assistance wrought through prayers. For not only at the time of

regeneration, but afterwards also, they have authority to forgive sins. "Is
any sick among you?" it is said, "let him call for the elders of the Church
and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up:
and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him." Again: our
natural parents, should their children come into conflict with any men of
high rank and great power in the world, are unable to profit them: but
priests have reconciled, not rulers and kings, but God Himself when His
wrath has often been provoked against them. Well! after this will any one
venture to condemn me for arrogance? For my part, after what has been
said, I imagine such religious fear will possess the souls of the hearers that
they will no longer condemn those who avoid the office for arrogance and
temerity, but rather those who voluntarily come forward and are eager to
obtain this dignity for themselves. For if they who have been entrusted
with the command of cities, should they chance to be wanting in discretion
and vigilance, have sometimes destroyed the cities and ruined themselves
in addition, how much power think you both in himself and from above
must he need, to avoid sinning, whose business it is to beautify the Bride
of Christ?

7. No man loved Christ more than Paul: no man exhibited greater zeal, no
man was counted worthy of more grace: nevertheless, after all these great
advantages, he still has fears and tremblings concerning this government
and those who were governed by him. "I fear," he says, "lest by any
means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds
should be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ." And again, "I
was with you in fear and in much trembling;" and this was a man who had
been caught up to the third Heaven, and made partaker of the unspeakable
mysteries of God, and had endured as many deaths as he had lived days
after he became a believer - a man, moreover, who would not use the
authority given him from Christ lest any of his converts should be
offended. If, then, he who went beyond the ordinances of God, and
nowhere sought his own advantage, but that of those whom he governed,
was always so full of fear when he considered the greatness of his
government, what shall our condition be who in many ways seek our own,
who not only fail to go beyond the commandments of Christ, but for the
most part transgress them? "Who is weak," he says, "and I am not weak?

who is offended and I burn not?" Such an one ought the priest to be, or,
rather, not such only: for these are small things, and as nothing compared
with what I am about to say. And what is this? "I could wish," he says,
"that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen
according to the flesh." If any one can utter such a speech, if any one has
the soul which attains to such a prayer, he might justly be blamed if he
took to flight: but if any one should lack such excellence as much as I do,
he would deserve to be hated, not if he avoided the office, but if he
accepted it. For if an election to a military dignity was the business in
hand, and they who had the right of conferring the honor were to drag
forward a brazier, or a shoemaker, or some such artisan, and entrust the
army to his hands, I should not praise the wretched man if he did not take
to flight, and do all in his power to avoid plunging into such manifest
trouble. If, indeed, it be sufficient to bear the name of pastor, and to take
the work in hand hap-hazard, and there be no danger in this, then let
whoso pleases accuse me of vainglory; but if it behooves one who
undertakes this care to have much understanding, and, before
understanding, great grace from God, and uprightness of conduct, and
purity of life and superhuman virtue, do not deprive me of forgiveness if I
am unwilling to perish in vain without a cause.

Moreover, if any one in charge of a full-sized merchant ship, full of
rowers, and laden with a costly freight, were to station me at the helm and
bid me cross the Aegean or the Tyrrhene sea, I should recoil from the
proposal at once: and if any one asked me why? I should say, "Lest I
should sink the ship." Well, where the loss concerns material wealth, and
the danger extends only to bodily death, no one will blame those who
exercise great prudence; but where the shipwrecked are destined to fall, not
into the ocean, but into the abyss of fire, and the death which awaits them
is not that which severs the soul from the body, but one which together
with this dismisses it to eternal punishment, shall I incur your wrath and
hate because I did not plunge headlong into so great an evil?

8. Do not thus, I pray and beseech you. I know my own soul, how feeble
and puny it is: I know the magnitude of this ministry, and the great
difficulty of the work; for more stormy billows vex the soul of the priest
than the gales which disturb the sea.

9. And first of all is that most terrible rock of vainglory, more dangerous
than that of the Sirens, of which the fable-mongers tell such marvelous
tales: for many were able to sail past that and escape unscathed; but this is
to me so dangerous that even now, when no necessity of any kind impels
me into that abyss, I am unable to keep clear of the snare: but if any one
were to commit this charge to me, it would be all the same as if he tied my
hands behind my back, and delivered me to the wild beasts dwelling on
that rock to rend me in pieces day by day. Do you ask what those wild
beasts are? They are wrath, despondency, envy, strife, slanders,
accusations, falsehood, hypocrisy, intrigues, anger against those who have
done no harm, pleasure at the indecorous acts of fellow, ministers, sorrow
at their prosperity, love of praise, desire of honor (which indeed most of
all drives the human soul headlong to perdition), doctrines devised to
please, servile flatteries, ignoble fawning, contempt of the poor, paying
court to the rich, senseless and mischievous honors, favors attended with
danger both to those who offer and those who accept them, sordid fear
suited only to the basest of slaves, the abolition of plain speaking, a great
affectation of humility, but banishment of truth, the suppression of
convictions and reproofs, or rather the excessive use of them against the
poor, while against those who are invested with power no one dare open
his lips.

For all these wild beasts, and more than these, are bred upon that rock of
which I have spoken, and those whom they have once captured are
inevitably dragged down into such a depth of servitude that even to please
women they often do many things which it is well not to mention. The
divine law indeed has excluded women from the ministry, but they
endeavor to thrust themselves into it; and since they can effect nothing of
themselves, they do all through the agency of others; and they have
become invested with so much power that they can appoint or eject
priests at their will: things in fact are turned upside down, and the
proverbial saying may be seen realized - "The ruled lead the rulers:" and
would that it were men who do this instead of women, who have not
received a commission to teach. Why do I say teach? for the blessed Paul
did not suffer them even to speak in the Church. But I have heard some
one say that they have obtained such a large privilege of free speech, as

even to rebuke the prelates of the Churches, and censure them more
severely than masters do their own domestics.

10. And let not any one suppose that I subject all to the aforesaid charges:
for there are some, yea many, who are superior to these entanglements,
and exceed in number those who have been caught by them. Nor would I
indeed make the priesthood responsible for these evils: far be such
madness from me. For men of understanding do not say that the sword is
to blame for murder, nor wine for drunkenness, nor strength for outrage,
nor courage for foolhardiness, but they lay the blame on those who make
an improper use of the gifts which have been bestowed upon them by
God, and punish them accordingly. Certainly, at least, the priesthood may
justly accuse us if we do not rightly handle it. For it is not itself a cause of
the evils already mentioned, but we, who as far as lies in our power have
defiled it with so many pollutions, by entrusting it to commonplace men
who readily accept what is offered them, without having first acquired a
knowledge of their own souls, or considered the gravity of the office, and
when they have entered on the work, being blinded by inexperience,
overwhelm with innumerable evils the people who have been committed to
their care. This is the very thing which was very nearly happening in my
case, had not God speedily delivered me from those dangers, mercifully
sparing his Church and my own soul. For, tell me, whence do you think
such great troubles are generated in the Churches? I, for my part, believe
the only source of them to be the inconsiderate and random way in which
prelates are chosen and appointed. For the head ought to be the strongest
part, that it may be able to regulate and control the evil exhalations which
arise from the rest of the body below; but when it happens to be weak in
itself, and unable to repel those pestiferous attacks, it becomes feebler
itself than it really is, and ruins the rest of the body as well. And to
prevent this now coming to pass, God kept me in the position of the feet,
which was the rank originally assigned to me. For there are very many
other qualities, Basil, besides those already mentioned, which the priest
ought to have, but which I do not possess; and, above all, this one: - his
soul ought to be thoroughly purged from any lust after the office: for if he
happens to have a natural inclination for this dignity, as soon as he attains
it a stronger flame is kindled, and the man being taken completely captive
will endure innumerable evils in order to keep a secure hold upon it, even

to the extent of using flattery, or submitting to something base and ignoble,
or expending large sums of money. For I will not now speak of the
murders with which some have filled the Churches, or the desolation
which they have brought upon cities in contending for the dignity, lest
some persons should think what I say incredible. But I am of opinion one
ought to exercise so much caution in the matter, as to shun the burden of
the office, and when one has entered upon it, not to wait for the judgment
of others should any fault be committed which warrants deposition, but to
anticipate it by ejecting oneself from the dignity; for thus one might
probably win mercy for himself from God: but to cling to it in defiance of
propriety is to deprive oneself of all forgiveness, or rather to kindle the
wrath of God, by adding a second error more offensive than the first.

11. But no one will always endure the strain; for fearful, truly fearful is the
eager desire after this honor. And in saying this I am not in opposition to
the blessed Paul, but in complete harmony with his words. For what says
he? "If any than desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work."
Now I have not said that it is a terrible thing to desire the work, but only
the authority and power. And this desire I think one ought to expel from
the soul with all possible earnestness, not permitting it at the outset to be
possessed by such a feeling, so that one may be able to do everything with
freedom. For he who does not desire to be exhibited in possession of this
authority, does not fear to be deposed from it, and not fearing this will be
able to do everything with the freedom which becomes Christian men:
whereas they who fear and tremble lest they should be deposed undergo a
bitter servitude, filled with all kinds of evils, and are often compelled to
offend against both God and man. Now the soul ought not to be affected in
this way; but as in warfare we see those soldiers who are noble-spirited
fight willingly and fall bravely, so they who have attained to this
stewardship should be contented to be consecrated to the dignity or
removed from it, as becomes Christian men, knowing that deposition of
this kind brings its reward no less than the discharge of the office. For
when any one suffers anything of this kind, in order to avoid submitting to
something which is unbecoming or unworthy of this dignity, he procures
punishment for those who wrongfully depose him, and a greater reward
for himself." Blessed," says our Lord, "are ye when men shall revile you
and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for

my sake; rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven."
And this, indeed, is the case when any one is expelled by those of his own
rank either on account of envy, with a view to the favor of others, or
through hatred, or from any other wrong motive: but when it is the lot of
any one to experience this treatment at the hand of opponents, I do not
think a word is needed to prove what great gain they confer upon him by
their wickedness.

It behooves us, then, to be on the watch on all sides, and to make a careful
search lest any spark of this desire should be secretly smoldering
somewhere. For it is much to be wished that those who are originally free
from this passion, should also be able to avoid it when they have lighted
upon this office. But if any one, before he obtains the honor, cherishes in
himself this terrible and savage monster, it is impossible to say into what a
furnace he will fling himself after he has attained it. Now I possessed this
desire in a high degree (and do not suppose that I would ever tell you what
was untrue in self-disparagement): and this, combined with other reasons,
alarmed me not a little, and induced me to take flight. For just as lovers of
the human person, as long as they are permitted to be near the objects of
their affection, suffer more severe torment from their passion, but when
they remove as far as possible from these objects of desire, they drive
away the frenzy: even so when those who desire this dignity are near it,
the evil becomes intolerable: but when they cease to hope for it, the desire
is extinguished together with the expectation.

12. This single motive then is no slight one: and even taken by itself it
would have sufficed to deter me from this dignity: but, as it is, another
must be added not less than the former. And what is this? A priest ought
to be sober minded, and penetrating in discernment, and possessed of
innumerable eyes in every direction, as one who lives not for himself alone
but for so great a multitude. But that I am sluggish and slack, and scarcely
able to bring about my own salvation, even you yourself would admit,
who out of love to me art especially eager to conceal my faults. Talk not
to me in this connection of fasting, and watching, or sleeping on the
ground, and other hard discipline of the body: for you know how defective
I am in these matters: and even if they had been carefully practiced by me
they could not with my present sluggishness have been of any service to
me with a view to this post of authority. Such things might be of great

service to a man who was shut up in a cell, and caring only for his own
concerns: but when a man is divided among so great a multitude, and enters
separately into the private cares of those who are under his direction, what
appreciable help can be given to their improvement unless he possesses a
robust and exceedingly vigorous character?

13. And do not be surprised if, in connection with such endurance, I seek
another test of fortitude in the soul. For to be indifferent to food and drink
and a soft bed, we see is to many no hard task, especially at least to such
as are of a rough habit of life and have been brought up in this way from
early youth, and to many others also; bodily discipline and custom
softening the severity of these laborious practices: but insult, and abuse,
and coarse language, and gibes from inferiors whether wantonly or justly
uttered, and rebukes vainly and idly spoken both by rulers and the ruled
- this is what few can bear, in fact only one or two here and there; and
one may see men, who are strong in the former exercises, so completely
upset by these things, as to become more furious than the most savage
beasts. Now such men especially we should exclude from the precincts of
the priesthood. For if a prelate did not loathe food, or go barefoot, no harm
would be done to the common interests of the Church; but a furious
temper causes great disasters both to him who possesses it, and to his
neighbors. And there is no divine threat against those who fail to do the
things referred to, but hell and hell-fire are threatened against those who
are angry without a cause. As then the lover of vainglory, when he takes
upon him the government of numbers, sup plies additional fuel to the fire,
so he who by himself, or in the company of a few, is unable to control his
anger, but readily carried away by it, should he be entrusted with the
direction of a whole multitude, like some wild beast goaded on all sides by
countless tormentors, would never be able to live in tranquillity himself,
and would cause incalculable mischief to those who have been committed
to his charge.

14. For nothing clouds the purity of the reason, and the perspicuity of the
mental vision so much as undisciplined wrath, rushing along with violent
impetuosity. "For wrath," says one, "destroys even the prudent." For the
eye of the soul being darkened as in some nocturnal battle is not able to
distinguish friends from foes, nor the honorable from the unworthy, but
handles them all in turn in the same way; even if some harm must be

suffered, readily enduring everything, in order to satisfy the pleasure of
the soul. For the fire of wrath is a kind of pleasure, and tyrannizes over
the soul more harshly than pleasure, completely upsetting its healthy
organization. For it easily impels men to arrogance, and unseasonable
enmities, and unreasonable hatred, and it continually makes them ready to
commit wanton and vain offenses; and forces them to say and do many
other things of that kind, the soul being swept along by the rush of
passion, and having nothing on which to fasten its strength and resist so
great an impulse.

BASIL: I will not endure this irony of yours any longer: for who knows
not how far removed you are from this infirmity?

CHRYSOSTOM: Why then, my good friend, do you wish to bring me
near the pyre, and to provoke the wild beast when he is tranquil? Are you
not aware that I have achieved this condition, not by any innate virtue, but
by my love of retirement? and that when one who is so constituted
remains contented by himself, or only associates with one or two friends,
he is able to escape the fire which arises from this passion, but not if he
has plunged into the abyss of all these cares? for then he drags not only
himself but many others with him to the brink of destruction, and renders
them more indifferent to all consideration for mildness. For the mass of
people under government are generally inclined to regard the manners of
those who govern as a kind of model type, and to assimilate themselves to
them. How then could any one put a stop to their fury when he is swelling
himself with rage? And who amongst the multitude would straightway
desire to become moderate when he sees the ruler irritable? For it is quite
impossible for the defects of priests to be concealed, but even trifling ones
speedily become manifest. So an athlete, as long as he remains at home,
and contends with no one, can dissemble his weakness even if it be very
great, but when he strips for the contest he is easily detected. And thus for
some who live this private and inactive life, their isolation serves as a veil
to hide their defects; but when they have been brought into public they are
compelled to divest themselves of this mantle of seclusion, and to lay bare
their souls to all through their visible movements. As therefore their right
deeds profit many, by provoking them to equal zeal, so their shortcomings
make men more indifferent to the practice of virtue, and encourage them to
indolence in their endeavors after what is excellent. Wherefore his soul

ought to gleam with beauty on every side, that it maybe able to gladden
and to enlighten the souls of those who behold it. For the faults of
ordinary men, being committed as it were in the dark, ruin only those who
practice them: but the errors of a man in a conspicuous position, and
known to many, inflicts a common injury upon all, rendering those who
have fallen more supine in their efforts for good, and driving to desperation
those who wish to take heed to themselves. And apart from these things,
the faults of insignificant men, even if they are exposed, inflict no injury
worth speaking of upon any one: but they who occupy the highest seat of
honor are in the first place plainly visible to all, and if they err in the
smallest matters these trifles seem great to others: for all men measure the
sin, not by the magnitude of the offense, but by the rank of the offender.
Thus the priest ought to be protected on all sides by a kind of adamantine
armor, by intense earnestness, and perpetual watchfulness concerning his
manner of life, lest some one discovering an exposed and neglected spot
should inflict a deadly wound: for all who surround him are ready to smite
and overthrow him: not enemies only and adversaries, but many even of
those who profess friendship.

The souls therefore of men elected to the priesthood ought to be endued
with such power as the grace of God bestowed on the bodies of those
saints who were cast into the Babylonian furnace. Faggot and pitch and
tow are not the fuel of this fire, but things far more dreadful: for it is no
material fire to which they are subjected, but the all-devouring flame of
envy encompasses them, rising up on every side, and assailing them, and
putting their life to a more searching test than the fire then was to the
bodies of those young men. When then it finds a little trace of stubble, it
speedily fastens upon it; and this unsound part it entirely consumes, but
all the rest of the fabric, even if it be brighter than the sunbeams, is
scorched and blackened by the smoke. For as long as the life of the priest
is well regulated in every direction, it is invulnerable to plots; but if he
happens to overlook some trifle, as is natural in a human being, traversing
the treacherous ocean of this life, none of his other good deeds are of any
avail in enabling him to escape the mouths of his accusers; but that little
blunder overshadows all the rest. And all men are ready to pass judgment
on the priest as if he was not a being clothed with flesh, or one who
inherited a human nature, but like an angel, and emancipated from every

species of infirmity. And just as all men fear and flatter a tyrant as long as
he is strong, because they cannot put him down, but when they see his
affairs going adversely, those who were his friends a short time before
abandon their hypocritical respect, and suddenly become his enemies and
antagonists, and having discovered all his weak points, make an attack
upon him, and depose him from the government; so is it also in the case of
priests. Those who honored him and paid court to him a short time before,
while he was strong, as soon as they have found some little handle eagerly
prepare to depose him, not as a tyrant only, but something far more
dreadful than that. And as the tyrant fears his body guards, so also does
the priest dread most of all his neighbors and fellow-ministers. For no
others covet his dignity so much, or know his affairs so well as these; and
if anything occurs, being near at hand, they perceive it before others, and
even if they slander him, can easily command belief, and, by magnifying
trifles, take their victim captive. For the apostolic saying is reversed,
"whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one
member be honored, all the members rejoice with it;" unless indeed a man
should be able by his great discretion to stand his ground against
everything.

Are you then for sending me forth into so great a warfare? and did you
think that my soul would be equal to a contest so various in character and
shape? Whence did you learn this, and from whom? If God certified this to
you, show me the oracle, and I obey; but if you cannot, and form your
judgment from human opinion only, please to set yourself free from this
delusion. For in what concerns my own affairs it is fairer to trust me than
others; inasmuch as "no man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit
of man which is in him." That I should have made myself and my electors
ridiculous, had I accepted this office, and should with great loss have
returned to this condition of life in which I now am, I trust I have now
convinced you by these remarks, if not before. For not malice only, but
something much stronger - the lust after this dignity - is wont to arm
many against one who possesses it. And just as avaricious children are
oppressed by the old age of their parents, so some of these, when they see
the priestly office held by any one for a protracted time - since it would
be wickedness to destroy him - hasten to depose him from it, being all

desirous to take his place, and each expecting that the dignity will be
transferred to himself.

15. Would you like me to show you yet another phase of this strife,
charged with innumerable dangers? Come, then, and take a peep at the
public festivals when it is generally the custom for elections to be made to
ecclesiastical dignities, and you will then see the priest assailed with
accusations as numerous as the people whom he rules. For all who have
the privilege of conferring the honor are then split into many parties; and
one can never find the council of elders of one mind with each other, or
about the man who has won the prelacy; but each stands apart from the
others, one preferring this man, another that. Now the reason is that they
do not all look to one thing, which ought to be the only object kept in
view, the excellence of the character; but other qualifications are alleged as
recommending to this honor; for instance, of one it is said, "let him be
elected because he belongs to an illustrious family," of another "because he
is possessed of great wealth, and would not need to be supported out of
the revenues of the Church," of a third "because he has come over from the
camp of the adversary;" one is eager to give the preference to a man who is
on terms of intimacy with himself, another to the man who is related to
him by birth, a third to the flatterer, but no one will look to the man who
is really qualified, or make some test of his character. Now I am so far
from thinking these things trustworthy criteria of a man's fitness for the
priesthood, that even if any one manifested great piety, which is no small
help in the discharge of that office, I should not venture to approve him on
that account alone, unless he happened to combine good abilities with his
piety. For I know many men who have exercised perpetual restraint upon
themselves, and consumed themselves with fastings, who, as long as they
were suffered to be alone, and attend to their own concerns, have been
acceptable to God, and day by day have made no small addition to this
kind of learning; but as soon as they entered public life, and were
compelled to correct the ignorance of the multitude, have, some of them,
proved from the outset incompetent for so great a task, and others when
forced to persevere in it, have abandoned their former strict way of living,
and thus inflicted great injury on themselves without profiting others at
all. And if any one spent his whole time in the lowest rank of the ministry,
and reached extreme old age, I would not, merely out of reverence for his

years, promote him to the higher dignity; for what if, after arriving at that
time of life, he should still remain unfit for the office? And I say this now,
not as wishing to dishonor the gray head, nor as laying down a law
absolutely to exclude from this authority those who come from the
monastic circle (for there are instances of many who issued from that
body, having shone conspicuously in this dignity); but the point which I
am anxious to prove is, that if neither piety of itself, nor advanced age,
would suffice to show that a man who had obtained the priesthood really
deserved it, the reasons formerly alleged would scarcely effect this. There
are also men who bring forward other pretexts yet more absurd; for some
are enrolled in the ranks of the clergy, that they may not range themselves
among opponents, and others on account of their evil disposition, lest
they should do great mischief if they are overlooked. Could anything be
more contrary to right rule than this? that bad men, laden with iniquity,
should be courted on account of those things for which they ought to be
punished, and ascend to the priestly dignity on account of things for
which they ought to be debarred from the very threshold of the Church.
Tell me, then, shall we seek any further the cause of God's wrath when we
expose things so holy and awful to be defiled by men who are either
wicked or worthless? for when some men are entrusted with the
administration of things which are not at all suitable to them, and others of
things which exceed their natural power, they make the condition of the
Church like that of Euripus.

Now formerly I used to deride secular rulers, because in the distribution of
their honors they are not guided by considerations of moral excellence, but
of wealth, and seniority, and human distinction; but when I heard that this
kind of folly had forced its way into our affairs also, I no longer regarded
their conduct as so atrocious. For what wonder is it that worldly men,
who love the praise of the multitude, and do everything for the sake of
gain, should commit these sins, when those who affect at least to be free
from all these influences are in no wise better disposed than they, but
although engaged in a contest for heavenly things, act as if the question
submitted for decision was one which concerned acres of land, or
something else of that kind? for they take commonplace men off-hand, and
set them to preside over those things, for the sake of which the only
begotten Son of God did not refuse to empty Himself of His glory and

become man, and take the form of a servant, and be spat upon, and
buffeted, and die a death of reproach in the flesh. Nor do they stop even
here, but add to these offenses others still more monstrous; for not only
do they elect unworthy men, but actually expel those who are well
qualified. As if it were necessary to ruin the safety of the Church on both
sides, or as if the former provocation were not sufficient to kindle the
wrath of God, they have contrived yet another not less pernicious. For I
consider it as atrocious to expel the useful men as to force in the useless.
And this in fact takes place, so that the flock of Christ is unable to find
consolation in any direction, or draw its breath freely. Now do not such
deeds deserve to be punished by ten thousand thunder-bolts, and a
hell-fire hotter than that with which we are threatened [in Holy Scripture]?
Yet these monstrous evils are born with by Him who willeth not the death
of a sinner, that he may be converted and live. And how can one
sufficiently marvel at His lovingkindness, and be amazed at His mercy?
They who belong to Christ destroy the property of Christ more than
enemies and adversaries, yet the good Lord still deals gently with them,
and calls them to repentance. Glory be to Thee, O Lord! Glory to Thee!
How vast is the depth of Thy lovingkindness! how great the riches of Thy
forbearance! Men who on account of Thy name have risen from
insignificance and obscurity to positions of honor and distinction, use the
honor they enjoy against Him who has bestowed it, do deeds of
outrageous audacity, and insult holy things, rejecting and expelling men of
zeal in order that the wicked may ruin everything at their pleasure in much
security, and with the utmost fearlessness. And if you would know the
causes of this dreadful evil, you will find that they are similar to those
which were mentioned before; for they have one root and mother, so to
say - namely, envy; but this is manifested in several different forms: For
one we are told is to be struck out of the list of candidates, because he is
young; another because he does not know how to flatter; a third because
he has offended such and such a person; a fourth lest such and such a man
should be pained at seeing one whom he has presented rejected, and this
man elected; a fifth because he is kind and gentle; a sixth because he is
formidable to the sinful; a seventh for some other like reason; for they are
at no loss to find as many pretexts as they want, and can even make the
abundance of a man's wealth an objection when they have no other. Indeed
they would be capable of discovering other reasons, as many as they wish,

why a man ought not to be brought suddenly to this honor, but gently and
gradually. And here I should like to ask the question, "What, then, is the
prelate to do, who has to contend with such blasts? How shall he hold his
ground against such billows? How shall he repel all these assaults?"

For if he manages the business upon upright principles, all those who are
enemies and adversaries both to him and to the candidates do everything
with a view to contention, provoking daily strife, and heaping infinite
scorn upon the candidates, until they have got them struck off the list, or
have introduced their own favorites. In fact it is just as if some pilot had
pirates sailing with him in his ship, perpetually plotting every hour against
him, and the sailors, and marines. And if he should prefer favor with such
men to his own salvation, accepting unworthy candidates, he will have
God for his enemy in their stead; and what could be more dreadful than
that? And yet his relations with them will be more embarrassing than
formerly, as they will all combine with each other, and thereby become
more powerful than before. For as when fierce winds coming from
opposite directions clash with one another, the ocean, hitherto calm,
becomes suddenly furious and raises its crested waves, destroying those
who are sailing over it, so also when the Church has admitted corrupt men,
its once tranquil surface is covered with rough surf and strewn with
shipwrecks.

16. Consider, then, what kind of man he ought to be who is to hold out
against such a tempest, and to manage skillfully such great hindrances to
the common welfare; for he ought to be dignified yet free from arrogance,
formidable yet kind, apt to command yet sociable, impartial yet courteous,
humble yet not servile, strong yet gentle, in order that he may contend
successfully against all these difficulties. And he ought to bring forward
with great authority the man who is properly qualified for the office, even
if all should oppose him, and with the same authority to reject the man
who is not so qualified, even if all should conspire in his favor, and to keep
one aim only in view, the building up of the Church, in nothing actuated
either by enmity or favor. Well, do you now think that I acted reasonably
in declining the ministry of this office? But I have not even yet gone
through all my reasons with you; for I have some others still to mention.
And do not grow impatient of listening to a friendly and sincere man, who
wishes to clear himself from your accusations; for these statements are not

only serviceable for the defense which you have to make on my behalf, but
they will also prove of no small help for the due administration of the
office. For it is necessary for one who is going to enter upon this path of
life to investigate all matters thoroughly well, before he sets his hand to
the ministry. Do you ask why? Because one who knows all things clearly
will have this advantage, if no other, that he will not feel strange when
these things befall him. Would you like me then to approach the question
of superintending widows, first of all, or of the care of virgins, or the
difficulty of the judicial function. For in each of these cases there is a
different kind of anxiety, and the fear is greater than the anxiety.

Now in the first place, to start from that subject which seems to be
simpler than the others, the charge of widows appears to cause anxiety to
those who take care of them only so far as the expenditure of money is
concerned; but the case is otherwise, and here also a careful scrutiny is
needed, when they have to be enrolled, for infinite mischief has been
caused by putting them on the list without due discrimination. For they
have ruined households, and severed marriages, and have often been
detected in thieving and pilfering and unseemly deeds of that kind. Now
that such women should be supported out of the Church's revenues
provokes punishment from God, and extreme condemnation among men,
and abates the zeal of those who wish to do good. For who would ever
choose to expend the wealth which he was commanded to give to Christ
upon those who defame the name of Christ? For these reasons a strict and
curate scrutiny ought to be made so as to prevent the supply of the
indigent being wasted, not only by the women already mentioned, but also
by those who are able to provide for themselves. And this scrutiny is
succeeded by no small anxiety of another kind, to ensure an abundant and
unfailing stream of supply as from a fountain; for compulsory poverty is
an insatiable kind of evil, querulous and ungrateful. And great discretion
and great zeal is required so as to stop the mouths of complainers,
depriving them of every excuse. Now most men, when they see any one
superior to the love of money, forthwith represent him as well qualified
for this stewardship. But I do not think that this greatness of soul is ever
sufficient of itself, although it ought to be possessed prior to all other
qualities; for without this a man would be a destroyer rather than a
protector, a wolf instead of a shepherd; nevertheless, combined with this,

the possession of another quality also should be demanded. And this
quality is forbearance, the cause of all good things in men, impelling as it
were and conducting the soul into a serene haven. For widows are a class
who, both on account of their poverty, their age and natural disposition,
indulge in unlimited freedom of speech (so I had best call it); and they
make an unseasonable clamor and idle complaints and lamentations about
matters for which they ought to be grateful, and bring accusations
concerning things which they ought contentedly to accept. Now the
superintendent should endure all these things in a generous spirit, and not
be provoked either by their unreasonable annoyance or their unreasonable
complaints. For this class of persons deserve to be pitied for their
misfortunes, not to be insulted; and to trample upon their calamities, and
add the pain of insult to that which poverty brings, would be an act of
extreme brutality. On this account one of the wisest of men, having regard
to the avarice and pride of human nature, and considering the nature of
poverty and its terrible power to depress even the noblest character, and
induce it often to act in these same respects without shame, in order that a
man should not be irritated when accused, nor be provoked by continual
importunity to become an enemy where he ought to bring aid, he instructs
him to be affable and accessible to the suppliant, saying, "Incline thine ear
to a poor man and give him a friendly answer with meekness." And
passing by the case of one who succeeds in exasperating (for what can one
say to him who is overcome?), he addresses the man who is able to bear
the other's infirmity, exhorting him before he bestows his gift to correct
the suppliant by the gentleness of his countenance and the mildness of his
words. But if any one, although he does not take the property (of these
widows), nevertheless loads them with innumerable reproaches, and
insults them, and is exasperated against them, he not only fails through his
gift to alleviate the despondency produced by poverty, but aggravates the
distress by his abuse. For although they may be compelled to act very
shamelessly through the necessity of hunger, they are nevertheless
distressed at this compulsion. When, then, owing to the dread of famine,
they are constrained to beg, and owing to their begging are constrained to
put off shame, and then again on account of their shamelessness are
insulted, the power of despondency becoming of a complex kind, and
accompanied by much gloom, settles down upon the soul. And one who
has the charge of these persons ought to be so long-suffering, as not only

not to increase their despondency by his fits of anger, but also to remove
the greater part of it by his exhortation. For as the man who has been
insulted, although he is in the enjoyment of great abundance, does not feel
the advantage of his wealth, on account of the blow which he has received
from the insult; so on the other hand, the man who has been addressed
with kindly words, and for whom the gift has been accompanied with
encouragement, exults and rejoices all the more, and the thing given
becomes doubled in value through the manner in which it is offered. And
this I say not of myself, but borrow from him whose precept I quoted just
now: "My son, blemish not thy good deeds, neither use uncomfortable
words when thou givest anything. Shall not the dew assuage the heat? So
is a word better than a gift. Lo! is not a word better than a gift? but both
are with a gracious man."

But the superintendent of these persons ought not only to be gentle and
forbearing, but also skillful in the management of property; for if this
qualification is wanting, the affairs of the poor are again involved in the
same distress. One who was entrusted not long ago with this ministry, and
got together a large hoard of money, neither consumed it himself, nor
expended it with a few exceptions upon those who needed it, but kept the
greater part of it buried in the earth until a season of distress occurred,
when it was all surrendered into the bands of the enemy. Much
forethought, therefore, is needed, that the resources of the Church should
be neither over abundant, nor deficient, but that all the supplies which are
provided should be quickly distributed among those who require them, and
the treasures of the Church stored up in the hearts of those who are under
her rule.

Moreover, in the reception of strangers, and the care of the sick, consider
how great an expenditure of money is needed, and how much exactness
and discernment on the part of those who preside over these matters. For
it is often necessary that this expenditure should be even larger than that
of which I spoke just now, and that he who presides over it should
combine prudence and wisdom with skill in the art of supply, so as to
dispose the affluent to be emulous and ungrudging in their gifts, lest while
providing for the relief of the sick, he should vex the souls of those who
supply their wants. But earnestness and zeal need to be displayed here in
a far higher degree; for the sick are difficult creatures to please, and prone

to languor; and unless great accuracy and care are used, even a slight
oversight is enough to do the patient great mischief.

17. But in the care of virgins, the fear is greater in proportion as the
possession is more precious, and this flock is of a nobler character than the
others. Already, indeed, even into the band of these holy ones, an infinite
number of women have rushed full of innumerable bad qualities; and in this
case our grief is greater than in the other; for there is just the same
difference between a virgin and a widow going astray, as between a
free-born damsel and her handmaid. With widows, indeed, it has become a
common practice to trifle, and to rail at one another, to flatter or to be
impudent, to appear everywhere in public, and to perambulate the
market-place. But the virgin has striven for nobler aims, and eagerly sought
the highest kind of philosophy, and professes to exhibit upon earth the life
which angels lead, and while yet in the flesh proposes to do deeds which
belong to the incorporeal powers. Moreover, she ought not to make
numerous or unnecessary journeys, neither is it permissible for her to utter
idle and random words; and as for abuse and flattery, she should not even
know them by name. On this account she needs the most careful
guardianship, and the greater assistance. For the enemy of holiness is
always surprising and lying in wait for these persons, ready to devour any
one of them if she should slip and fall; many men also there are who lay
snares for them; and besides all these things there is the passionateness of
their own human nature, so that, speaking generally, the virgin has to
equip herself for a twofold war, one which attacks her from without, and
the other which presses upon her from within. For these reasons he who
has the superintendence of virgins suffers great alarm, and the danger and
distress is yet greater, should any of the things which are contrary to his
wishes occur, which God forbid. For if a daughter kept in seclusion is a
cause of sleeplessness to her father, his anxiety about her depriving him of
sleep, where the fear is so great lest she should be childless, or pass the
flower of her age (unmarried), or be hated (by her husband), what will he
suffer whose anxiety is not concerned with any of these things, but others
far greater? For in this, case it is not a man who is rejected, but Christ
Himself, nor is this barrenness the subject merely of reproach, but the evil
ends in the destruction of the soul; "for every tree," it is said, "which
bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire." And for

one who has been repudiated by the divine Bridegroom, it is not sufficient
to receive a certificate of divorce and so to depart, but she has to pay the
penalty of everlasting punishment. Moreover, a father according to the
flesh has many things which make the custody of his daughter easy; for
the mother, and nurse, and a multitude of handmaids share in helping the
parent to keep the maiden safe. For neither is she permitted to be
perpetually hurrying into the market-place, nor when she does go there is
she compelled to show herself to any of the passers-by, the evening
darkness concealing one who does not wish to be seen no less than the
walls of the house. And apart from these things, she is relieved from every
cause which might otherwise compel her to meet the gaze of men; for no
anxiety about the necessaries of life, no menaces of oppressors, nor
anything of that kind reduces her to this unfortunate necessity, her father
acting in her stead in all these matters; while she herself has only one
anxiety, which is to avoid doing or saying anything unworthy the modest
conduct which becomes her. But in the other case there are many things
which make the custody of the virgin difficult, or rather impossible for the
father; for he could not have her in his house with himself, as dwelling
together in that way would be neither seemly nor safe. For even if they
themselves should suffer no loss, but continue to preserve their innocence
unsullied, they would have to give an account for the souls which they
have offended, just as much as if they happened to sin with one another.
And it being impossible for them to live together, it is not easy to
understand the movements of the character, and to suppress the impulses
which are ill regulated, or train and improve those which are better ordered
and tuned. Nor is it an easy thing to interfere in her habits of walking out;
for her poverty and want of a guardian does not permit him to become an
exact investigator of the propriety of her conduct. For as she is compelled
to manage all her affairs she has many pretexts for going out, if at least she
is not inclined to be self-controlled. Now he who commands her to stay
always at home ought to cut off these pretexts, providing for her
independence in the necessaries of life, and giving her some woman who
will see to the management of these things. He must also keep her away
from funeral obsequies, and nocturnal festivals; for that artful serpent
knows only too well how to scatter his poison through the medium even
of good deeds. And the maiden must be fenced on every side, and rarely go
out of the house during the whole year, except when she is constrained by

inexorable necessity. Now if any one should say that none of these things
is the proper work of a bishop to take in hand, let him be assured that the
anxieties and the reasons concerning what takes place in every case have to
be referred to him. And it is far more expedient that he should manage
everything, and so be delivered from the complaints which he must
otherwise undergo on account of the faults of others, than that he should
abstain from the management, and then have to dread being called to
account for things which other men have done. Moreover, he who does
these things by himself, gets through them all with great ease; but he who
is compelled to do it by converting every one's opinion does not get relief
by being saved from working single-handed, equivalent to the trouble and
turmoil which he experiences through those who oppose him and combat
his decisions. However, I could not enumerate all the anxieties concerned
with the care of virgins; for when they have to be entered on the list, they
occasion no small trouble to him who is entrusted with this business.

Again, the judicial department of the bishop's office involves innumerable
vexations, great consumption of time, and difficulties exceeding those
experienced by men who sit to judge secular affairs; for it is a labor to
discover exact justice, and when it is found, it is difficult to avoid
destroying it. And not only loss of time and difficulty are incurred, but
also no small danger. For ere now, some of the weaker brethren having
plunged into business, because they have not obtained patronage have
made shipwreck concerning the faith. For many of those who have
suffered wrong, no less than those who have inflicted wrong, hate those
who do not assist them, and they will not take into account either the
intricacy of the matters in question, or the difficulty of the times, or the
limits of sacerdotal authority, or anything of that kind; but they are
merciless judges, recognizing only one kind of defense - release from the
evils which oppress them. And he who is unable to furnish this, although
he may allege innumerable excuses, will never escape their condemnation.

And talking of patronage, let me disclose another pretext for fault-finding.
For if the bishop does not pay a round of visits every day, more even than
the idle men about town, unspeakable offense ensues. For not only the
sick, but also the whole, desire to be looked after, not that piety prompts
them to this, but rather that in most cases they pretend claims to honor
and distinction. And if he should ever happen to visit more constantly one

of the richer and more powerful men, under the pressure of some
necessity, with a view to the common benefit of the Church, he is
immediately stigmatized with a character for fawning and flattery. But
why do I speak of patronage and visiting? For merely from their mode of
accosting persons, bishops have to endure such a load of reproaches as to
be often oppressed and overwhelmed by despondency; in fact, they have
also to undergo a scrutiny of the way in which they use their eyes. For the
public rigorously criticize their simplest actions, taking note of the tone of
their voice, the cast of their countenance, and the degree of their laughter.
He laughed heartily to such a man, one will say, and accosted him with a
beaming face, and a clear voice, whereas to me he addressed only a slight
and passing remark. And in a large assembly, if he does not turn his eyes
in every direction when he is conversing, the majority declare that his
conduct is insulting.

Who, then, unless he is exceedingly strong, could cope with so many
accusers, so as either to avoid being indited altogether, or, if he is indited,
to escape? For he must either be without any accusers, or, if this is
impossible, purge himself of the accusations which are brought against
him; and if this again is not an easy matter, as some men delight in making
vain and wanton charges, he must make a brave stand against the dejection
produced by these complaints. He, indeed, who is justly accused, may
easily tolerate the accuser, for there is no bitterer accuser than conscience;
wherefore, if we are caught first by this most terrible adversary, we can
readily endure the milder ones who are external to us. But he who has no
evil thing upon his conscience, when he is subjected to an empty charge, is
speedily excited to wrath, and easily sinks into dejection, unless he
happens to have practiced beforehand how to put up with the follies of
the multitude. For it is utterly impossible for one who is falsely accused
without cause, and condemned, to avoid feeling some vexation and
annoyance at such great injustice.

And how can one speak of the distress which bishops undergo, whenever
it is necessary to cut some one off from the full communion of the
Church? Would indeed that the evil went no further than distress! but in
fact the mischief is not trifling. For there is a fear lest the man, if he has
been punished beyond what he deserves, should experience that which
was spoken of by the blessed Paul and "be swallowed up by overmuch

sorrow." The nicest accuracy, therefore, is required in this matter also, lest
what is intended to be profitable should become to him an occasion of
greater damage. For whatever sins he may commit after such a method of
treatment, the wrath caused by each of them must be shared by the
physician who so unskillfully applied his knife to the wound. What severe
punishment, then, must be expected by one who has not only to render an
account of the offenses which he himself has separately committed, but
also incurs extreme danger on account of the sins committed by others?
For if we shudder at undergoing judgment for our own misdeeds, believing
that we shall not be able to escape the fire of the other world, what must
one expect to suffer who has to answer for so many others? To prove the
truth of this, listen to the blessed Paul, or rather not to him, but to Christ
speaking in him, when he says "Obey them that have the rule over you,
and submit, for they watch for your souls as they that shall give account."
Can the dread of this threat be slight? It is impossible to say: but these
considerations are sufficient to convince even the most incredulous and
obdurate that I did not make this escape under the influence of pride or
vainglory, but merely out of fear for my own safety, and consideration of
the gravity of the office.

BOOK 4

BASIL heard this, and after a little pause thus replied:

If thou wert thyself ambitious of obtaining this office, thy fear would have
been reasonable; for in being ambitious of undertaking it, a man confesses
himself to be qualified for its administration, and if he fail therein, after it
has been entrusted to him, he cannot take refuge in the plea of
inexperience, for he has deprived himself of this excuse beforehand, by
having hurriedly seized upon the ministry, and whoever willingly and
deliberately enters upon it, can no longer say, "I have sinned in this matter
against my will - and against my will I have ruined such and such a soul;"
for He who will one day judge him, will say to him, "Since then thou wert
conscious of such inexperience, and hadst not ability for undertaking this
matter without incurring reproach, why wert thou so eager and
presumptuous as to take in hand what was so far beyond thy power?
Who compelled thee to do so? Didst thou shrink or fly, and did any one
drag thee on by force?" But thou wilt hear nothing like this, for thou canst
have nothing of this kind to condemn thyself for; and it is evident to all
that thou wert in no degree ambitious of this dignity, for the
accomplishment of the matter was due to the action of others. Hence,
circumstances which leave those who are ambitious of this office no
chance of pardon when they err therein, afford thee ample ground for
excuse.

CHRYSOSTOM: At this I shook my head and smiled a little, admiring
the simple-mindedness of the man, and thus addressed him: I could wish
indeed that matters were as thou sayest, most excellent of men, but not in
order that I might be able to accept that office from which I lately fled. For
if, indeed, no chastisement were to await me for undertaking the care of the
flock of Christ without consideration and experience, yet to me it would
be worse than all punishment, after being entrusted with so great a charge,
to have seemed so base towards Him who entrusted me with it. For what
reason, then, did I wish that thou wert not mistaken in this opinion of
thine? truly for the sake of those wretched and unhappy beings (for so
must I call them, who have not found out how to discharge the duties of
this office well though thou weft to say ten thousand times over that they

had been driven to undertake it, and that, therefore, their errors therein are
sins of ignorance) - for the sake, I say, of such that they might succeed in
escaping that unquenchable fire, and the outer darkness and the worm that
dieth not and the punishment of being cut asunder, and perishing together
with the hypocrites.

But what am I to do for thee? It is not as thou sayest; no, by no means.
And if thou wilt, I will give thee a proof of what I maintain, from the case
of a kingdom, which is not of such account with God as the priesthood.
Saul, that son of Kish, was not himself at all ambitious of becoming a king,
but was going in quest of his asses, and came to ask the prophet about
them. The prophet, however, proceeded to speak to him of the kingdom,
but not even then did he run greedily after it, though he heard about it from
a prophet, but drew back and deprecated it, saying, "Who am I, and what
is my father's house." What then? When he made a bad use of the honor
which had been given him by God, were those words of his able to rescue
him from the wrath of Him who had made him king? And was he able to
say to Samuel, when rebuked by him: "Did I greedily run and rush after
the kingdom and sovereign power? I wished to lead the undisturbed and
peaceful life of ordinary men, but thou didst drag me to this post of honor.
Had I remained in my low estate I should easily have escaped all these
stumbling blocks, for were I one of the obscure multitude, I should never
have been sent forth on this expedition, nor would God have committed to
my hands the war against the Amalekites, and if I had not had it
committed to me, I should not have sinned this sin." But all such
arguments are weak as excuses, and not only weak, but perilous, inasmuch
as they rather kindle the wrath of God. For he who has been promoted to
great honor by God, must not advance the greatness of his honor as an
excuse for his errors, but should make God's special favor towards him the
motive for further improvement; whereas he who thinks himself at liberty
to sin because he has obtained some uncommon dignity, what does he but
study to show that the lovingkindness of God is the cause of his personal
transgression, which is always the argument of those who lead godless and
careless lives. But we ought to be on no account thus minded, nor to fall
away into the insane folly of such people, but be ambitious at all times to
make the most of such powers as we have, and to be reverent both in
speech and thought.

For (to leave the kingdom and to come to the priesthood, which is the
more immediate subject of our discourse) neither was Eli ambitious of
obtaining his high office, yet what advantage was this to him when he
sinned therein? But why do I say obtain it? not even had he wished could
he have avoided it, because he was under a legal necessity to accept it. For
he was of the tribe of Levi, and was bound to undertake that high office
which descended to him from his forefathers, notwithstanding which even
he paid no small penalty for the lawlessness of his sons. And the very
first High Priest of the Jews, concerning whom God spake so many words
to Moses, when he was unable to withstand alone the frenzy of so great a
multitude, was he not very nearly being destroyed, but for the intercession
of his brother, which averted the wrath of God? And since we have
mentioned Moses, it will be well to show the truth of what we are saying
from what happened to him. For this same saintly Moses was so far from
grasping at the leadership of the Jews as to deprecate the offer, and to
decline it when God commanded him to take it, and so to provoke the
wrath of Him who appointed him; and not only then, but afterwards when
he entered upon his rule, he would gladly have died to have been set free
from it: "Kill me," saith he, "if thou art going to deal thus with me." But
what then? when he sinned at the waters of strife, could these repeated
refusals be pleaded in excuse for him? Could they prevail with God to
grant him pardon? And wherefore was he deprived of the promised land?
for no other reason, as we all know, than for this sin of his, for which that
wondrous man was debarred from enjoying the same blessings which those
over whom he ruled obtained; but after many labors and sufferings, after
that unspeakable wandering, after so many, battles fought and victories
won, he died outside the land to reach which he had undergone so much
toil and trial; and though he had weathered the storms of the deep, he
failed to enjoy the blessings of the haven after all. From hence then thou
seest that not only they who grasp at this office are left without excuse for
the sins they commit in the discharge thereof, but they too who come to it
through the ambitious desire of others; for truly if those persons who have
been chosen for this high office by God himself, though they have never so
often refused it, have paid such heavy penalties, and if nothing has availed
to deliver any of them from this danger, neither Aaron nor Eli, nor that
holy man the Saint, the prophet, the wonder worker, the meek above all
the men which were upon the face of the earth, who spake with God, as a

man speaketh unto his friend, hardly shall we who fall so infinitely short
of the excellence of that great man, be able to plead as a sufficient excuse
the consciousness that we have never been ambitious of the dignity, more
especially when many of the ordinations now-a-days do not proceed from
the grace of God, but are due to human ambition. God chose Judas, and
counted him one of the sacred band, and committed to him, as to the rest,
the dignity of the apostolic office; yea he gave him somewhat beyond the
others, the stewardship of the money. But what of that? when he
afterwards abused both these trusts, betraying Him whom he was
commissioned to preach, and misapplying the money which he should
have laid out well; did he escape punishment? nay for this very reason he
even brought upon himself greater punishment, and very reasonably too.
For we must not use the high honors given to us by God so as to offend
Him, but so as to please Him better. But he who claims exemption from
punishment where it is due, because he has been exalted to higher honor
than others, acts very much like one of those unbelieving Jews, who after
hearing Christ say, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not
had sin, "If I had not done among them the works which none other did,
they had not had sin," should reproach the Savior and benefactor of
mankind by replying," Why, then, didst thou come and speak? why didst
thou work miracles? was it that thou mightest punish us the more?" But
these are the words of madness and of utter senselessness. For the Great
Physician came not to give thee over, but to heal thee - not to pass thee
by when thou wert sick, but to rid thee entirely of disease. But thou hast
of thine own accord withdrawn thyself from his hands; receive therefore
the sorer punishment. For as thou wouldest have been freed from thy
former maladies if thou hadst yielded to his treatment, so if, when thou
sawest him coming to thine aid thou reddest from him, thou wilt no longer
be able to cleanse thyself of these infirmities, and as thou art unable, thou
wilt both suffer punishment for them, and also because for thy part thou
madest God's solicitude for thy good of none effect. Therefore we who act
like this are not subjected to the same torment after as before we received
honor at God's hands, but far severer torment after than before. For he
who has not become good even by being well treated, deserves all the
bitterer punishment. Since, then, this excuse of thine has been shown to be
weak, and not only fails to save those who take refuge in it, but exposes

them so much the more, we must provide ourselves with some other
means of safety.

BASIL: Tell me of what nature is that? since, as for me, I am at present
scarce master of myself, thou hast reduced me to such a state of fear and
trembling by what thou hast said.

CHRYSOSTOM: Do not, I beseech and implore thee, do not be so
downcast. For while there is safety for us who are weak, namely, in not
undertaking this office at all, there is safety for you too who are strong,
and this consists in making your hopes of salvation depend, next to the
grace of God, on avoiding every act unworthy of this gift, and of God who
gave it. For they certainly would be deserving of the greatest punishment
who, after obtaining this dignity through their own ambition, should then
either on account of sloth, or wickedness, or even inexperience, abuse the
office. Not that we are to gather from this that there is pardon in store for
those who have not been thus ambitious. Yea, even they too are deprived
of all excuse. For in my judgment, if ten thousand were to entreat and urge,
a man should pay them no attention, but should first of all search his own
heart, and examine the whole matter carefully before yielding to their
importunities. Now no one would venture to undertake the building of a
house were he not an architect, nor will any one attempt the cure of sick
bodies who is not a skilled physician; but even though many urge him, will
beg off, and will not be ashamed to own his ignorance; and shall he who is
going to have the care of so many souls entrusted to him, not examine
himself beforehand? will he accept this ministry even though he be the
most inexperienced of men, because this one commands him, or that man
constrains him, or for fear of offending a third? And if so, how will he
escape casting himself together with them into manifest misery. Had he
continued as he was, it were possible for him to be saved, but now he
involves others in his own destruction. For whence can he hope for
salvation? whence to obtain pardon? Who will then successfully intercede
for us? they who are now perhaps urging us and forcibly dragging us on?
But who will save these same at such a moment? For even they too will
stand in need in their turn of intercession, that they may escape the fire.
Now, that I say not these things to frighten thee, but as representing the
matter as in truth it is, hear what the holy Apostle Paul saith to Timothy
his disciple, his own and beloved son, "Lay hands suddenly on no man,

neither be partaker of other men's sins." Dost thou not see from what
great blame, yea and vengeance, we, so far as in us lies, have delivered
those who were ready to put us forward for this office.

2. For as it is not enough for those who are chosen to say in excuse for
themselves, "I did not summon myself to this office, nor could I avoid
what I did not see beforehand;" so neither will it be a sufficient plea for
those who ordain them to say that they did not know him who was
ordained. The charge against them becomes greater on account of their
ignorance of him whom they brought forward, and what seems to excuse
them only serves to accuse them the more. For how absurd a thing, is it
not? that they who want to buy a slave, show him to the physician, and
require sureties for the sale, and information about him from their
neighbors, and after all this do not yet venture on his purchase without
asking for some time for a trial of him; while they who are going to admit
any one to so great an office as this, give their testimonial and their
sanction loosely and carelessly, without further investigation, just because
some one wishes it, or to court the favor, or to avoid the displeasure of
some one else. Who shall then successfully intercede for us in that day,
when they who ought to defend us stand themselves in need of defenders?
He who is going to ordain, therefore, ought to make diligent inquiry, and
much more he who is to be ordained. For though they who ordain him
share his punishment, for any sins which he may commit in his office, yet
so far from escaping vengeance he will even pay a greater penalty than
they - save only if they who chose him acted from some worldly motive
contrary to what seemed justifiable to themselves. For if they should be
detected so doing, and knowing a man to be unworthy have brought him
forward on some pretext or other, the amount of their punishment shall be
equivalent to his, nay perhaps the punishment shall be even greater for
them who appointed the unfit man. For he who gives authority to any one
who is minded to destroy the Church, would be certainly to blame for the
outrages which that person commits. But if he is guilty of no such thing,
and says that he has been misled by the opinions of others, even then he
shall not altogether remain unpunished, but his punishment shall be a little
lighter than his who has been ordained. What then? It is possible that they
who elect may come to the election deceived by a false report. But he who
is elected could not say, "I am ignorant of myself," as others were of him.

As one who will receive therefore a sorer punishment than they who put
him forward, so should he make his scrutiny of himself more careful than
that which they make of him; and if they in ignorance drag him on, he
ought to come forward and instruct them carefully about any matters
whereby he may stop their being misled; and so having shown himself
unworthy of trial may escape the burden of so high an office.

For what is the reason why, in the arts of war, and merchandise, and
husbandry, and other departments of this life, when some plan is
proposed, the husbandman will not undertake to navigate the ship, nor the
soldier to till the ground, nor the pilot to lead an army, under pain of ten
thousand deaths? Is it not plainly this? that each foresees the danger which
would attend his incompetence? Well, where the loss is concerned with
trifles shall we use so much forethought, and refuse to yield to the
pressure of compulsion, but where the punishment is eternal, as it is for
those who know not how to handle the Priesthood, shall we wantonly and
inconsiderately run into so great danger, and then advance, as our excuse,
the pressing entreaties of others? But He who one day will judge us will
entertain no such plea as this. For we ought to show far more caution in
spiritual matters than in carnal. But now we are not found exhibiting as
much caution. For tell me: if supposing a man to be an artificer, when he is
not so, we invited him to do a piece of work, and he were to respond to
the call, and then having set his hand to the material prepared for the
building, were to spoil the wood and spoil the stone, and so to build the
house that it straightway fell to pieces, would it be sufficient excuse for
him to allege that he had been urged by others and did not come of his own
accord? in no wise; and very reasonably and justly so. For he ought to
have refused even at the call of others. So for the man who only spoils
wood and stone, there will be no escape from paying the penalty, and is he
who destroys souls, and builds the temple of God carelessly, to think that
the compulsion of others is his warrant for escaping punishment? Is not
this very absurd? For I omit the fact as yet that no one is able to compel
the man who is unwilling. But be it that he was subjected to excessive
pressure and divers artful devices, and then fell into a snare; will this
therefore rescue him from punishment? I beseech thee, let us not deceive
ourselves, and pretend that we know not what is obvious to a mere child.
For surely this pretense of ignorance will not be able to profit in the day

of reckoning. Thou wert not ambitious, thou sayest, of receiving this high
office, conscious of thine own weakness. Well and good. Then thou
oughtest, with the same mind, to have declined the solicitation of others;
or, when no one called thee, wast thou weak and incapable, but when
those were found ready to offer thee this dignity, didst thou suddenly
become competent? What ludicrous nonsense! worthy of the extremest
punishment. For this reason also the Lord counsels the man who wishes to
build a tower, not to lay the foundation before he has taken his own ability
to build into account, lest he should give the passers by innumerable
opportunities of mocking at him. But in his case the penalty only consists
in becoming a laughing-stock; while in that before us the punishment is
that of fire unquenchable, and of an undying worm, gnashing of teeth,
outer darkness, and being cut asunder, and having a portion with the
hypocrites.

But my accusers are unwilling to consider any of these things. For
otherwise they would cease to blame a person who is unwilling to perish
without cause. It is not the management of corn and barley, oxen or sheep,
that is now under our consideration, nor any such like matters, but the
very Body of Jesus. For the Church of Christ, according to St. Paul, is
Christ's Body, and he who is entrusted with' its care ought to train it up
to a state of healthiness, and beauty unspeakable, and to look everywhere,
lest any spot or wrinkle, or other like blemish should mar its vigor and
comeliness. For what is this but to make it appear worthy, so far as
human power can, of the incorruptible and ever-blessed Head which is set
over it? If they who are ambitious of reaching an athletic condition of body
need the help of physicians and trainers, and exact diet, and constant
exercise, and a thousand other rules (for the omission of the merest trifle
upsets and spoils the whole), how shall they to whose lot falls the care of
the body, which has its conflict not against flesh and blood, but against
powers unseen, be able to keep it sound and healthy, unless they far
surpass ordinary human virtue, and are versed in all healing proper for the
soul?

3. Pray, art thou not aware that that body is subject to more diseases and
assaults than this flesh of ours, is more quickly corrupted, and more slow
to recover? and by those who have the healing of these bodies, divers
medicines have been discovered, and an apparatus of different instruments,

and diet suitable for the sick; and often the condition of the atmosphere is
of itself enough for the recovery of a sick man; and there are instances of
seasonable sleep having saved the physician all further labor. But in the
case before us, it is impossible to take any of these things into
consideration; nay there is but one method and way of healing appointed,
after we have gone wrong, and that is, the powerful application of the
Word. This is the one instrument, the only diet, the finest atmosphere.
This takes the place of physic, cautery and cutting, and if it be needful to
sear and amputate, this is the means which we must use, and if this be of
no avail, all else is wasted; with this we both rouse the soul when it sleeps,
and reduce it when it is inflamed; with this we cut off excesses, and fill up
defects, and perform all manner of other operations which are requisite for
the soul's health. Now as regards the ordering of our daily life for the best,
it is true that the life of another may provoke us to emulation. But in the
matter of spurious doctrine, when any soul is diseased thereby, then there
is great need of the Word, not only in view of the safety of our own
people, but in view of the enemy without. If, indeed, one had the sword of
the spirit, and the shield of faith, so as to be able to work miracles, and by
means of these marvels to stop the mouths of impudent gainsayers, one
would have little need of the assistance of the Word; still in the days of
miracles the Word was by no means useless, but essentially necessary. For
St. Paul made use of it himself, although he was everywhere so great an
object of wonder for this miracles; and another of those who belonged to
the "glorious company of the Apostles" exhorts us to apply ourselves to
acquiring this power, when he says: "Be ready always to give an answer
to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you,"
and they all, with one accord, committed the care of the poor widows to
Stephen, for no other reason than that they themselves might have leisure
"for the ministry of the Word." To this we ought equally to apply
ourselves, unless indeed we are endued with a power of working miracles.
But if there is not the least sign of such a power being left us, while on
every side many enemies are constantly attacking us, why then it
necessarily follows that we should arm ourselves with this weapon, both
in order that we may not be wounded ourselves with the darts of the
enemy, and in order that we may wound him.

4. Wherefore it should be our ambition that the Word of Christ dwell in us
richly. For it is not for one kind of battle only that we have to be
prepared. This warfare is manifold, and is engaged with a great variety of
enemies; neither do all these use the same weapons, nor do they practice
the same method of attack; and he who has to join battle with all, must
needs know the artifices of all, and be at once both archer and slinger,
captain and general, in the ranks and in command, on foot and on
horseback, in sea-fight and in siege. In common warfare, indeed, each man
repels the enemy by discharging the particular duty which he has
undertaken. But here it is otherwise; and if any one wishes to come off
conqueror in this warfare, he must understand all forms of the art, as the
devil knows well how to introduce his own assailants through any one
spot which may happen to be unguarded, and to carry off the sheep. But
not so where he perceives the shepherd coming equipped with accurate
knowledge at all points, and well acquainted with his plottings. Wherefore
we ought to be well-guarded in all parts: for a city, so long as it happens to
be surrounded with a wall, laughs to scorn the besiegers, abiding in great
security; but if any one makes a breach in the wall, though but of the size
of a gate, the rest of the circuit is of no use, although the whole of it stand
quite securely; so it is with the city of God: so long as the presence of
mind and wisdom of the shepherd, which answers to the wall, protect it
on all sides, all the enemy's devices end in his confusion and ridicule, and
they who dwell within the wall abide unmolested, but wherever any one
has been able to demolish a single part, though the rest stand never so fast,
through that breach ruin will enter upon the whole. For to what purpose
does a man contend earnestly with the Greeks, if at the same time he
becomes a prey to the Jews? or get the better of both these and then fall
into the clutches of the Manichaeans? or after he has proved himself
superior to them even, if they who introduce fatalism enter in, and make
havoc of the flock? But not to enumerate all the heresies of the devil, it
will be enough to say that unless the shepherd is well skilled in refuting
them all, the wolf, by means of any one of them, can enter, and devour the
greater part of the flock. In ordinary warfare we must always look for
victory being won or defeat sustained by the soldiers who are on the field
of battle. But in the spiritual warfare the case is quite different. For there it
often happens that the combat with one set of enemies secures a victory
for others who never engaged in battle at all, nor took any trouble, but

were sitting still all the while; and he who has not much experience in such
occurrences will get pierced, so to say, with his own sword, and become
the laughing-stock of friends and foes alike. I will try by an example to
make clear what I am saying. They who receive the wild doctrines of
Valentinus and Marcion, and of all whose minds are similarly diseased,
exclude the Law given by God to Moses from the catalogue of the Divine
Scriptures. But Jews so revere the Law, that although the time has come
which annuls it, they still contend for the observance of all its contents,
contrary to the purpose of God. But the Church of God, avoiding either
extreme, has trodden a middle path, and is neither induced on the one hand
to place herself under its yoke, nor on the other does she tolerate its being
slandered, but commends it, though its day is over, because of its
profitableness while its season lasted. Now it is necessary for him who is
going to fight with both these enemies, to be fully conversant with this
middle course, For if in wishing to teach the Jews that they are out of date
in clinging to the old law, he begins to find fault with it unsparingly, he
gives no little handle to those heretics who wish to pull it to pieces; and if
in his ambition to stop their mouths he extols it immoderately, and speaks
of it with admiration, as necessary for this present time, he unseals the
lips of the Jews. Again they who labor under the frenzy of Sabellius and
the craze of Arius, have both fallen from a sound faith for want of
observing a middle course. The name of Christian is applied to both these
heretics; but if any one examines their doctrines, he will find the one sect
not much better than the Jews, and differing from them only in name, and
the other very nearly holding the heresy of Paul of Samosata, and that
both are very wide of the truth. Great, therefore, is the danger in such
cases, and the way of orthodoxy is narrow and hemmed in by threatening
crags on either side, and there is no little fear, test when intending to strike
at one enemy we should be wounded by the other. For if any one assert
the unity of the Godhead, Sabellius straightway turns that expression to
the advantage of his own mental vagary, and if he distinguish the Persons,
and say that the Father is one, and the Son another, and the Holy Spirit a
third, up gets Arius, ready to wrest that distinction of Persons into a
difference of substance; so we must turn and flee both from the impious
confounding of the Persons by the one, and the senseless division of the
substance by the other, confessing, indeed, that the Godhead of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, is all one, while we add thereunto a

Trinity of Persons. For then we shall be able to fortify ourselves against
the attacks of both heretics. I might tell thee besides these, of several other
adversaries against which, except we contend bravely and carefully, we
shall leave the field covered with wounds.

5. Why should any one describe the silly chatter of our own people? For
these are not less than the attacks upon us from without, while they give
the teacher even more trouble. Some out of an idle curiosity are rashly bent
upon busying themselves about matters which are neither possible for
them to know, nor of any advantage to them if they could know them.
Others again demand from God an account of his judgments, and force
themselves to sound the depth of that abyss which is unfathomable. "For
thy judgments," saith the Scriptures, "are a great deep," and about their
faith and practice thou wouldest find few of them anxious, but the
majority curiously inquiring into matters which it is not possible to
discover, and the mere inquiry into which provokes God. For when we
make a determined effort to learn what He does not wish us to know, we
fail to succeed (for how should we succeed against the will of God?); and
there only remains for us the danger arising from our inquiry. Now, though
this be the case, whenever any one authoritatively stops the search, into
such fathomless depths, he gets himself the reputation of being proud and
ignorant; so that at such times much tact is needed on the Bishop's part,
so as to lead his people away from these unprofitable questions, and
himself escape the above-named censures. In short, to meet all these
difficulties, there is no help given but that of speech, and if any be
destitute of this power, the souls of those who are put under his charge (I
mean of the weaker and more meddlesome kind) are no better off than
ships continually storm tossed. So that the Priest should do all that in him
lies, to gain this means of strength.

6. BASIL: "Why, then, was not St. Paul ambitious of becoming perfect in
this art? He makes no secret of his poverty of speech, but distinctly
confesses himself to be unskilled, even telling the Corinthians so, who
were admired for their eloquence, and prided themselves upon it."

CHRYSOSTOM: This is the very thing which has ruined many and
made them remiss in the study of true doctrine. For while they failed to
fathom the depths of the apostle's mind, and to understand the meaning of

his words, they passed all their time slumbering and yawning, and paying
respect not to that ignorance which St. Paul acknowledges, but to a kind
from which he was as free as any man ever was in the world.

But leaving this subject to await our consideration, I say this much in the
meantime. Granting that St. Paul was in this respect as unskilled as they
would have him to be, what has that to do with the men of today? For he
had a greater power by far than power of speech, power which brought
about greater results too; which was that his bare presence, even though he
was silent, was terrible to the demons. But the men of the present day, if
they were all collected in one place, would not be able, with infinite
prayers and tears, to do the wonders that once were done by the
handkerchief of St. Paul. He too by his prayers raised the dead, and
wrought such other miracles, that he was held to be a God by heathen; and
before he was removed from this life, he was thought worthy to be caught
up as far as the third heaven, and to share in such converse as it is not
lawful for mortal ears to hear. But the men of today - not that I would
say anything harsh or severe, for indeed I do not speak by way of insult to
them, but only in wonder - how is it that they do not shudder when they
measure themselves with so great a man as this? For if we leave the
miracles and turn to the life of this blessed saint, and look into his angelic
conversation, it is in this rather than in his miracles that thou wilt find this
Christian athlete a conqueror. For how can one describe his zeal and
forbearance, his constant perils, his continual cares, and incessant anxiety
for the Churches; his sympathy with the weak, his many afflictions, his
unwonted persecutions, his deaths daily? Where is the spot in the world,
where is the continent or sea, that is a stranger to the labors of this
righteous man? Even the desert has known his presence, for it often
sheltered him in time of danger. For he underwent every species of attack,
and achieved every kind of victory, and there was never any end to his
contests and his triumphs.

Yet, all unawares, I have been led to do this man an injury. For his exploits
are beyond all powers of description, and beyond mine in particular, just
as the masters of eloquence surpass me. Nevertheless, since that holy
apostle will judge us, not by the issue, but by the motive, I shall not
forbear till I have stated one more circumstance which surpasses anything
yet mentioned, as much as he himself surpasses all his fellow men. And

what is this? After so many exploits, after such a multitude of victories, he
prayed that he might go into hell, and be handed over to eternal
punishment, if so be that those Jews, who had often stoned him, and done
what they could to make away with him, might be saved, and come over to
Christ. Now who so longed for Christ? If, indeed, his feelings towards him
ought not to be described as something nobler than longing; shall we then
any more compare ourselves with this saint, after so great grace was
imparted to him from above, after so great virtue was manifested in
himself? What could be more presumptuous?

Now, that he was not so unskilled, as some count him to be, I shall try to
show in what follows. The unskilled person in men's estimation is not
only one who is unpracticed in the tricks of profane oratory, but the man
who is incapable of contending for the defense of the right faith, and they
are right. But St. Paul did not say that he was unskilled in both these
respects, but in one only; and in support of this he makes a careful
distinction, saying that he was "rude in speech, but not in knowledge."
Now were I to insist upon the polish of Isocrates, the weight of
Demosthenes, the dignity of Thucydides, and the sublimity of Plato, in
any one bishop, St. Paul would be a strong evidence against me. But I pass
by all such matters and the elaborate ornaments of profane oratory; and I
take no account of style or of delivery; yea let a man's diction be poor and
his composition simple and unadorned, but let him not be unskilled in the
knowledge and accurate statement of doctrine; nor in order to screen his
own sloth, deprive that holy apostle of the greatest of his gifts, and the
sum of his praises.

7. For how was it, tell me, that he confounded the Jews which dwelt at
Damascus, though he had not yet begun to work miracles? How was it
that he wrestled with the Grecians and threw them? and why was he sent
to Tarsus? Was it not because he was so mighty and victorious in the
word, and brought his adversaries to such a pass that they, unable to
brook their defeat, were provoked to seek his life? At that time, as I said,
he had not begun to work miracles, nor could any one say that the masses
looked upon him with astonishment on account of any glory belonging to
his mighty works, or that they who contended with him were
overpowered by the force of public opinion concerning him. For at this
time he conquered by dint of argument only. How was it, moreover, that

he contended and disputed successfully with those who tried to Judaize in
Antioch? and how was it that that Areopagite, an inhabitant of Athens,
that most devoted of all cities to the gods, followed the apostle, he and his
wife? was it not owing to the discourse which they heard? And when
Eutychus fell from the lattice, was it not owing to his long attendance even
until midnight to St. Paul's preaching? How do we find him employed at
Thessalonica and Corinth, in Ephesus and in Rome itself? Did he not
spend whole nights and days in interpreting the Scriptures in their order?
and why should any one recount his disputes with the Epicureans and
Stoics. For were we resolved to enter into every particular, our story
would grow to an unreasonable length.

When, therefore, both before working miracles, and after, St. Paul appears
to have made much use of argument, how can any one dare to pronounce
him unskillful whose sermons and disputations were so exceedingly
admired by all who heard them? Why did the Lycaonians imagine that he
was Hermes? The opinion that he and Barnabas were gods indeed, arose
out of the sight of their miracles; but the notion that he was Hermes did
not arise from this, but was a consequence of his speech. In what else did
this blessed saint excel the rest of the apostles? and how comes it that up
and down the world he is so much on every one's tongue? How comes it
that not merely among ourselves, but also among Jews and Greeks, he is
the wonder of wonders? Is it not from the power of his epistles? whereby
not only to the faithful of today, but from his time to this, yea and up to
the end, even the appearing of Christ, he has been and will be profitable,
and will continue to be so as long as the human race shall last. For as a wall
built of adamant, so his writings fortify all the Churches of the known
world, and he as a most noble champion stands in the midst, bringing into
captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ, casting down
imaginations, and every high thing which exalts itself against the
knowledge of God, and all this he does by those epistles which he has left
to us full of wonders and of Divine wisdom. For his writings are not only
useful to us, for the overthrow of false doctrine and the confirmation of
the true, but they help not a little towards living a good life. For by the use
of these, the bishops of the present day fit and fashion the chaste virgin,
which St. Paul himself espoused to Christ, and conduct her to the state of
spiritual beauty; with these, too, they drive away from her the noisome

pestilences which beset her, and preserve the good health thus obtained.
Such are the medicines and such their efficacy left us by this so-called
unskillful man, and they know them and their power best who constantly
use them. From all this it is evident that St. Paul had given himself to the
study of which we have been speaking with great diligence and zeal.

8. Hear also what he says in his charge to his disciple: "Give heed to
reading, to exhortation, to teaching," and he goes on to show the usefulness
of this by adding, "For in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them
that hear thee." And again he says, "The Lord's servant must not strive,
but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing;" and he proceeds to say,
"But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been
assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them, and that from a babe
thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto
salvation," and again, "Every Scripture is inspired of God, and also
profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is
in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete." Hear what he
adds further in his directions to Titus about the appointment of bishops.
"The bishop," he says, "must be holding to the faithful word which is
according to the teaching, that he may be able to convict the gain-sayers."
But how shall any one who is unskillful as these men pretend, be able to
convict the gainsayers and stop their mouths? or what need is there to give
attention to reading and to the Holy Scriptures, if such a state of
unskillfulness is to be welcome among us? Such arguments are mere
makeshifts and pretexts, the marks of idleness and sloth. But some one
will say, "it is to the priests that these charges are given:" - certainly, for
they are the subjects of our discourse. But that the apostle gives the same
charge to the laity, hear what he says in another epistle to other than the
priesthood: "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom,"
and again, "Let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt, that
ye may know how ye ought to answer each one," and there is a general
charge to all that they "be ready to" render an account of their faith, and to
the Thessalonians, he gives the following command: "Build each other up,
even as also ye do." But when he speaks of priests he says, "Let the
elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those
who labor in the word, and in teaching." For this is the perfection of
teaching when the teachers both by what they do, and by what they say

as well, bring their disciples to that blessed state of life which Christ
appointed for them. For example alone is not enough to instruct others.
Nor do I say this of myself; it is our Savior's own word. "For whosoever
shall do and teach them, he shall be called great. Now if doing were the
same as teaching, the second word here would be superfluous; and it had
been enough to have said "whosoever shall do" simply. But now by
distinguishing the two, he shows that practice is one thing, and doctrine
another, and that each needs the help of the others in order to complete
edification. Thou hearest too what the chosen vessel of Christ says to the
Ephesian elders: "Wherefore watch ye, remembering that for the space of
three years, I ceased not to admonish every one, night and day, with
tears." But what need was there for his tears or for admonition by word of
mouth, while his life as an apostle was so illustrious? His holy life might
be a great inducement to men to keep the commandments, yet I dare not
say that it alone could accomplish everything.

9. But when a dispute arises concerning matters of doctrine, and all take
their weapons from the same Scriptures, of what weight will any one's life
be able to prove? What then will be the good of his many austerities, when
after such painful exercises, any one from the Priest's great unskillfulness
in argument fall into heresy, and be cut off from the body of the Church, a
misfortune which I have myself seen many suffering. Of what profit then
will his patience be to him? None; no more than there will be in a sound
faith if the life is corrupt. Wherefore, for this reason more than for all
others, it concerns him whose office it is to teach others, to be experienced
in disputations of this kind. For though he himself stands safely, and is
unhurt by the gainsayers, yet the simple multitude under his direction,
when they see their leader defeated, and without any answer for the
gainsayers, will be apt to lay the blame of his discomfiture not on his own
weakness, but on the doctrines themselves, as though they were faulty;
and so by reason of the inexperience of one, great numbers are brought to
extreme ruin; for though they do not entirely go over to the adversary, yet
they are forced to doubt about matters in which formerly they firmly
believed, and those whom they used to approach with unswerving
confidence, they are unable to hold to any longer steadfastly, but in
consequence of their leader's defeat, so great a storm settles down upon
their souls, that the mischief ends in their shipwreck altogether. But how

dire is the destruction, and how terrible the fire which such a leader brings
upon his own wretched head for every soul which is thus lost, thou wilt
not need to learn from me, as thou knowest all this perfectly. Is this then
pride, is this vainglory in me, to be unwilling to be the cause of the
destruction of so many souls? and of procuring for myself greater
punishment in the world to come, than that which now awaits me there?
Who would say so? surely no one, unless he should wish to find fault
where there is none, and to moralize over other men's calamities.

BOOK 5

1. How great is the skill required for the teacher in contending earnestly for
the truth, has been sufficiently set forth by us. But I have to mention one
more matter beside this, which is a cause of numberless dangers, though
for my own part I should rather say that the thing itself is not the cause,
but they who know not how to use it rightly, since it is of itself a help to
salvation and to much good besides, whenever thou findest that earnest
and good men have the management of it. What then, do I mean by this?
The expenditure of great labor upon the preparation of discourses to be
delivered in public. For to begin with, the majority of those who are under
the preachers' charge are not minded to behave towards them as towards
teachers, but disdaining the part of learners, they assume instead the
attitude of those who sit and look on at the public games; and just as the
multitude there is separated into parties, and some attach themselves to
one, and some to another, so here also men are divided, and become the
partisans now of this teacher, now of that, listening to them with a view to
favor or spite. And not only is there this hardship, but another quite as
great. For if it has occurred to any preacher to weave into his sermons any
part of other men's works, he is exposed to greater disgrace than those
who steal money. Nay, often where he has not even borrowed anything
from any one, but is only suspected, he has suffered the fate of a thief.
And why do I speak of the works of others when it is not permitted to
him to use his own resources without variety? For the public are
accustomed to listen not for profit, but for pleasure, sitting like critics of
tragedies, and of musical entertainments, and that facility of speech against
which we declaimed just now, in this case becomes desirable, even more
than in the case of barristers, where they are obliged to contend one against
the other. A preacher then should have loftiness of mind, far exceeding my
own littleness of spirit, that he may correct this disorderly and
unprofitable pleasure on the part of the multitude, and be able to lead them
over to a more useful way of hearing, that his people may follow and yield
to him, and that he may not be led away by their own humors, and this it
is not possible to arrive at, except by two means: indifference to their
praise, and the power of preaching well.

2. For if either of these be lacking the remaining one becomes useless,
owing to its divorce from the other, for if a preacher be indifferent to
praise, and yet cannot produce the doctrine "which is with grace seasoned
with salt," he becomes despised by the multitude, while he gains nothing
from his own nobleness of mind; and if on the other hand he is successful
as a preacher, and is overcome by the thought of applause, harm is equally
done in turn, both to himself and the multitude, because in his desire for
praise he is careful to speak rather with a view to please than to profit.
And as he who neither lets good opinion influence him, nor is skillful in
speaking, does not yield to the pleasure of the multitude, and is unable to
do them any good worth mentioning, because he has nothing to say, so he
who is carried away with desire for praise, though he is able to render the
multitude better service, rather provides in place of this such food as will
suit their taste, because he purchases thereby the tumult of acclamation.

3. The best kind of Bishop must, therefore, be strong in both these points,
so that neither may supplant the other. For if when he stands up in the
congregation and speaks words calculated to make the careless wince, he
then stumbles, and stops short, and is forced to blush at his failure, the
good of what he has spoken is immediately wasted. For they who are
rebuked, being galled by what has been told them, and unable to avenge
themselves on him otherwise, taunt him, with jeers at this ignorance of his,
thinking to screen their own reproach thereby. Wherefore he ought, like
some very good charioteer, to come to an accurate judgment about both
these good things, in order that he may be able to deal with both as he may
have need; for when he is irreproachable in the eyes of all, then he will be
able, with just so much authority as he wishes, both to correct and to
remit from correction all those who are under his rule. But without this it
will not be easy for him to do so. But this nobleness of soul should be
shown not only up to the limit of indifference to praise, but should go
further in order that the gain thus gotten may not in its turn be fruitless.

4. To what else ought he then to be indifferent? Slander and envy.
Unseasonable evil speaking, however (for of course the Bishop undergoes
some groundless censure), it is well that he should neither fear nor tremble
at excessively, nor entirely pass over; but we ought, though it happen to
be false, or to be brought against us by the common herd, to try and
extinguish it immediately. For nothing so magnifies both an evil and a good

report as the undisciplined mob. For accustomed to hear and to speak
without stopping to make inquiry, they repeat at random everything
which comes in their way, without any regard to the truth of it. Therefore
the Bishop ought not to be unconcerned about the multitude, but
straightway to nip their evil surmisings in the bud; persuading his
accusers, even if they be the most unreasonable of all men, and to omit
nothing which is able to dispel an ill-favored report. But if, when we do all
this, they who blame us will not be persuaded, thenceforward we should
give them no concern. Since if any one be too quick to be dejected by these
accidents, he will not be able at any time to produce anything noble and
admirable. For despondency and constant cares are mighty for destroying
the powers of the mind, and for reducing it to extreme weakness. Thus
then must the Priest behave towards those in his charge, as a father would
behave to his very young children; and as such are not disturbed either by
their insults or their blows, or their lamentations, nor even if they laugh
and rejoice with us, do we take much account of it; so should we neither be
puffed up by the promises of these persons nor cast down at their
censure, when it comes from them unseasonably. But this is hard, my
good friend; and perhaps, methinks, even impossible. For I know not
whether any man ever succeeded in the effort not to be pleased when he is
praised, and the man who is pleased at this is likely also to desire to enjoy
it, and the man who desires to enjoy it will, of necessity, be altogether
vexed and beside himself whenever he misses it. For as they who revel in
being rich, when they fall into poverty are grieved, and they who have
been used to live luxuriously cannot bear to live shabbily; so, too, they
who long for applause, not only when they are blamed without a cause,
but when they are not constantly being praised, become, as by some
famine, wasted in soul, particularly when they happen themselves to have
been used to praise, or if they hear others being praised. He who enters
upon the trial of preaching with desires of this kind, how many
annoyances and how many pangs dost thou think that he has? It is no
more possible for the sea to be without waves than that man to be without
cares and grief.

5. For though the preacher may have great ability (and this one would only
find in a few), not even in this case is he released from perpetual toil. For
since preaching does not come by nature, but by study, suppose a man to

reach a high standard of it, this will then forsake him if he does not
cultivate his power by constant application and exercise. So that there is
greater labor for the wiser than for the unlearned. For there is not the same
degree of loss attending negligence on the part of the one and the other, but
the loss is in exact proportion to the difference between the two
possessions. For the latter no one would blame, as they furnish nothing
worth regarding. But the former, unless they are constantly producing
matter beyond the reputation in which all hold them, great censure attends
on all hands; and besides these things, the latter would meet with
considerable praise, even for small performances, while the efforts of the
former, unless they be specially wonderful and startling, not only fail to
win applause, but meet with many fault-finders. For the audience set
themselves to be critics, not so much in judgment of what is said as of the
reputation of the speaker, so that whenever any one excels all others in
oratorical powers, then especially of all others does he need laborious
study. For this man is not allowed to avail himself of the usual plea which
human nature urges, that one cannot succeed in everything; but if his
sermons do not throughout correspond to the greatness of the expectations
formed, he will go away without having gained anything but countless
jeers and censures; and no one takes this into consideration about him, that
dejection and pain, and anxiety, and often anger, may step in, and dim the
clearness of his thoughts and prevent his productions from coming from
him unalloyed, and that on the whole, being but a man, he cannot be
constantly the same, nor at all times acquit himself successfully, but
naturally must sometimes fall short of the mark, and appear on a lower
level of ability than usual. None of these things, as I said, are they willing
to take into consideration, but charge him with faults as if they were
sitting in judgment on an angel; though in other cases, too, a man is apt to
overlook the good performances of his neighbor, though they be many and
great, and if anywhere a defect appears, even if it be accidental, even if it
only occur at long intervals, it is quickly perceived, and always
remembered, and thus small and trifling matters have often lessened the
glory of many and great doings.

6. Thou seest, my excellent friend, that the man who is powerful in
preaching has peculiar need of greater study than others; and besides
study, of forbearance also greater than what is needed by all those whom I

have already mentioned. For thus are many constantly springing up
against him, in a vain and senseless spirit, and having no fault to find with
him, but that he is generally approved of, hate him; and he must bear their
bitter malice nobly, for as they are not able to hide this cursed hatred,
which they so unreasonably entertain, they both revile, and censure, and
slander in private, and defame in public, and the mind which has begun to
be pained and exasperated, on every one of these occasions, will not
escape being corrupted by grief. For they will not only revenge themselves
upon him by their own acts, but will try to do so by means of others, and
often having chosen some one of those who are unable to speak a word,
will extol him with their praises and admire him beyond his worth. Some
do this through ignorance alone, some through ignorance and envy, in order
that they may ruin the reputation of the other, not that they may prove
the man to be wonderful who is not so, and the noble-minded man has not
only to struggle against these, but often against the ignorance of the whole
multitude; for since it is not possible that all those who come together
should consist of learned men, but the chances are that the larger part of
the congregation is composed of unlearned people, and that even the rest,
who are clearer headed than they, fall as far short of being able to criticize
sermons as the remainder again fall short of them; so that only one or two
are seated there who possess this power; it follows, of necessity, that he
who preaches better than others carries away less applause, and possibly
goes home without being praised at all, and he must be prepared to meet
such anomalies nobly, and to pardon those who commit them in ignorance,
and to weep for those who acquiesce in them on account of envy as
wretched and pitiable creatures, and not to consider that his powers have
become less on either of these accounts. For if a man, being a
pre-eminently good painter, and superior to all in his art, sees the portrait
which he has drawn with great accuracy held up to ridicule, he ought not
to be dejected, and to consider the picture poor, because of the judgment
of the ignorant; as he would not consider the drawing that is really poor to
be something wonderful and lovely, because of the astonishment of the
inartistic.

7. For let the best artificer be himself the critic of his own designs, and let
his performances be determined to be good or poor, according as the mind
which designed them gives sentence upon them. But let him not even

consider the opinion, so erroneous and inartistic, of the outside world. Let,
therefore, the man who undertakes the strain of teaching never give heed to
the good opinion of the outside world, nor be dejected in soul on account
of such persons; but laboring at his sermons so that he may please God,
(For let this alone be his rule and determination, in discharging this best
kind of workmanship, not acclamation, nor good opinions,) if, indeed, he
be praised by men, let him not repudiate their applause, and when his
hearers do not offer this, let him not seek it, let him not be grieved. For a
sufficient consolation in his labors, and one greater than all, is when he is
able to be conscious of arranging and ordering his teaching with a view to
pleasing God.

8. For if he be first carried away with the desire for indiscriminate praise,
he will reap no advantage from his labors, or from his power in preaching,
for the mind being unable to bear the senseless censures of the multitude is
dispirited, and casts aside all earnestness about preaching. Therefore it is
especially necessary to be trained to be indifferent to all kinds of praise.
For to know how to preach is not enough for the preservation of that
power, if this be not added: and if any one would examine accurately the
man who is destitute of this art, he will find that he needs to be indifferent
to praise no less than the other, for he will be forced to do many wrong
things in placing himself under the control of popular opinion. For not
having the energy to equal those who are in repute for the quality of their
preaching, he will not refrain from forming ill designs against them, from
envying them, and from blaming them without reason, and from many
such discreditable practices, but will venture everything, even if it be
needful to ruin his own soul, for the sake of bringing down their fame to
the level of his own insignificance. And in addition to this, he will leave off
his exertions about his work; a kind of numbness, as it were, spreading
itself over his mind. For much toil, rewarded by scanty praise, is sufficient
to cast down a man who cannot despise praise, and put him into a deep
lethargy, since the husbandman even when he spends time over some
sorry piece of land, and is forced to till a rock, quickly desists from his
work, unless he is possessed of much earnestness about the matter, or has
a fear of famine impending over him. For if they who are able to speak
with considerable power, need such constant exercise for the preservation
of their talent, he who collects no materials at all, but is forced in the midst

of his efforts to meditate; what difficulty, what confusion, what trouble
will he experience, in order that he may be able at great labor to collect a
few ideas! and if any of those clergy who are under his authority, and who
are placed in the inferior order, be able in that position to appear. to better
advantage than he; what a divine mind must he have, so as not to be seized
with envy or cast down by despondency. For, for one to be placed in a
station of higher dignity, and to be surpassed by his inferior in rank, and to
bear this nobly, would not be the part of any ordinary mind, nor of such
as my own, but of one as hard as adamant; and if, indeed, the man who is
in greater repute be very for-bearing and modest, the suffering becomes so
much the more easily born. But if he is bold and boastful and vainglorious,
a daily death would be desirable for the other; he will so embitter his life,
insulting him to his face, and laughing at him behind his back, wresting
much of his authority from him, and wishing to be everything himself. But
he is possessed of the greatest security, in all these circumstances, who
has fluency in preaching, and the earnest attention of the multitude about
him, and the affection of all those who are under his charge. Dost not thou
know what a passion for sermons has burst in upon the minds of
Christians now-a-days? and that they who practice themselves in
preaching are in especial honor, not only among the heathen, but among
them of the household of the faith? How then could any one bear such
disgrace as to find that all are mute when he is preaching, and think that
they are oppressed, and wait for the end of the sermon, as for some release
from work; while they listen to another with eagerness though he preach
long, and are sorry when he is about to conclude; and almost angry when it
is his purpose to be silent. If these matters seem to thee to be small, and
easily to be despised, it is because of thine inexperience. They are truly
enough to quench zeal, and to paralyze the powers of the mind, unless a
man withdraw himself from all human passions, and study to frame his
conduct after the pattern of those incorporeal powers, who are neither
pursued by envy, nor by longing for fame, nor by any other morbid
feeling. If then there be any man so constituted as to be able to subdue this
wild beast, so difficult to capture, so unconquerable, so fierce; that is to
say, public fame, and to cut off its many heads, or rather to forbid their
growth altogether; he will easily be able to repel these many violent
assaults, and to enjoy a kind of quiet haven of rest. But he who has not
freed himself from this monster, involves his soul in struggles of various

kinds, and perpetual agitation, and the burden both of despondency and of
other passions. But why need I detail the rest of these difficulties, which
no one will be able to describe, or to learn unless he has had actual
experience of them.

BOOK 6

1. OUR condition here, indeed, is such as thou hast heard. But our
condition hereafter how shall we endure, when we are compelled to give
our account for each of those who have been entrusted to us? For our
penalty is not limited to shame, but everlasting chastisement awaits us as
well. As for the passage, "Obey them that have the rule over you, and
submit to them, for they watch in behalf of your souls as they that shall
give account; though I have mentioned it once already, yet I will break
silence about it now, for the fear of its warning is continually agitating my
soul. For if for him who causes one only, and that the least, to stumble, it
is profitable that "a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and
that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea;" and if they who wound the
consciences of the brethren, sin against Christ Himself, what then will
they one day suffer, what kind of penalty will they pay, who destroy not
one only, or two, or three, but so many multitudes? For it is not possible
for inexperience to be urged as an excuse, nor to take refuge in ignorance,
nor for the plea of necessity or force to be put forward. Yea, if it were
possible, one of those under their charge could more easily make use of
this refuge for his own sins than bishops in the case of the sins of others.
Dost thou ask why? Because he who has been appointed to rectify the
ignorance of others, and to warn them beforehand of the conflict with the
devil which is coming upon them, will not be able to put forward ignorance
as his excuse, or to say, "I have never heard the trumpet sound, I did not
foresee the conflict." For he is set for that very purpose, says Ezekiel, that
he may sound the trumpet for others, and warn them of the dangers at
hand. And therefore his chastisement is inevitable, though he that perishes
happen to be but one. "For if when the sword comes, the watchman does
not sound the trumpet to the people, nor give them a sign, and the sword
come and take any man away, he indeed is taken away on account of his
iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hands."

2. Cease then to urge us on to a penalty so inevitable; for our discourse is
not about an army, or a kingdom; but about an office which needs the
virtues of an angel. For the soul of the Priest ought to be purer than the
very sunbeams, in order that the Holy Spirit may not leave him desolate,

in order that he may be able to say, "Now I live; and yet no longer I, but
Christ liveth in me." For if they who dwell in the desert, and are removed
far from the city and the market-place, and the tumult therein, and who
enjoy all their time a haven of rest, and of peacefulness, are not willing to
rely on the security of that manner of life, but add to it numberless other
safeguards, hedging themselves round on every side, and studying both to
speak and to act with great circumspection, so that to the utmost extent of
human power they may draw near to God with assurance, and with
unstained purity, what power and strength, thinkest thou, does the
ordained Priest need so as to be able to tear his soul away from every
defilement, and to keep its spiritual beauty unsullied? For he has need of
far greater purity than they; and whoever has need of greater purity, he
too is subject to more pressing temptations than they, which are able to
defile him, unless by using constant self-denial and much labor, he renders
his soul inaccessible to them. For beauty of face, elegance of movement, an
affected gait and lisping voice, penciled eyebrows and enameled cheeks,
elaborate braiding and dyeing of hair, costliness of dress, variety of golden
ornaments, and the glory of precious stones, the scent of perfumes, and all
those other matters to which womankind devote themselves, are enough to
disorder the mind, unless it happen to be hardened against them, through
much austerity of self restraint. Now to be disturbed indeed by such
things is nothing wonderful. But on the other hand, that the devil should
be able to hit and shoot down the souls of men by the opposite of these
- this is a matter which fills us with astonishment and perplexity.

3. For ere now some men who have escaped these snares, have been caught
by others widely differing from these. For even a neglected appearance,
unkempt hair, squalid dress, and an unpainted face, simple behavior, and
homely language, unstudied gait, and unaffected voice, a life of poverty, a
despised, unpatronized and lonely condition, have first drawn on the
beholder to pity, and next to utter ruin; and many who have escaped the
former nets, in the way of gold ornaments and perfumes, and apparel, and
all the rest, of which I have spoken as connected with them, have easily
fallen into these so widely differing from them, and have perished. When
then both by poverty and by riches, both by the adornment and the
neglect of the personal appearance, both by studied and unaffected
manners, in short by all those means which I have enumerated, war is

kindled in the soul of the beholder, and its artifices surround him on every
side, how will he be able to breathe freely while so many snares
encompass him? and what hiding-place will he be able to find - I do not
say so as to avoid being forcibly seized by them (for this is not altogether
difficult) - but so as to keep his own soul undisturbed by polluting
thoughts?

And I pass by honors, which are the cause of countless evils. For those
which come from the hands of women are ruinous to the vigor of
self-restraint, and often overthrow it when a. man does not know how to
watch constantly against such designs; while those which come from the
hands of men, unless a man receive them with much nobleness of mind, he
is seized with two contrary emotions, servile flattery and senseless pride.
To those who patronize him, he is obliged to cringe; and towards his
inferiors he is puffed up, on account of the honors which the others
confer, and is driven into the gulf of arrogance. We have mentioned these
matters indeed, but how harmful they actually are, no one could well learn
without experience. For not only these snares, but greater and more
delusive than these, he must needs encounter, who has his conversation in
the world. But he who is content with solitude, has freedom from all this,
and if at any time a strange thought creates a representation of this kind,
the image is weak, and capable of being speedily subdued, because there is
no fuel added to the flame from without, arising from actual sight. For the
recluse has but himself to fear for; or should he be forced to have the care
of others they are easily counted: and if they be many, yet they are less
than those in our Churches, and they give him who is set over them much
lighter anxiety about them, not only on account of their fewness, but
because they are all free from worldly concerns, and have neither wife nor
children, nor any such thing to care about; and this makes them very
deferential to their rulers, and allows them to share the same abode with
them, so that they are able to take in their failings accurately at a glance
and correct them, seeing that the constant supervision of a teacher is no
little help towards advance in virtue.

4. But of those who are subject to the Priest, the greater number are
hampered with the cares of this life, and this makes them the slower in the
performance of spiritual duties. Whence it is necessary for the teacher to
sow every day (so to speak), in order that by its frequency at least, the

word of doctrine may be able to be grasped by those who hear. For
excessive wealth, and an abundance of power, and sloth the offspring of
luxury, and many other things beside these, choke the seeds which have
been let fall. Often too the thick growth of thorns does not suffer the seed
to drop even upon the surface of the soil. Again, excess of trouble, stress
of poverty, constant insults, and other such things, the reverse of the
foregoing, take the mind away from anxiety about things divine; and of
their people's sins, not even the smallest part can become apparent; for
how should it, in the case of those the majority of whom they do not
know even by sight?

The Priest's relations with his people involve thus much difficulty. But if
any inquire about his relations with God, he will find the others to be as
nothing, since these require a greater and more thorough earnestness. For
he who acts as an ambassador on behalf of the whole city - but why do I
say the city? on behalf of the whole world indeed - prays that God
would be merciful to the sins of all, not only of the living, but also of the
departed. What manner of man ought he to be? For my part I think that
the boldness of speech of Moses and Elias, is insufficient for such
supplication. For as though he were entrusted with the whole world and
were himself the father of all men, he draws near to God, beseeching that
wars may be extinguished everywhere, that tumults may be quelled; asking
for peace and plenty, and a swift deliverance from all the ills that beset
each one, publicly and privately; and he ought as much to excel in every
respect all those on whose behalf he prays, as rulers should excel their
subjects.

And whenever he invokes the Holy Spirit, and offers the most dread
sacrifice, and constantly handles the common Lord of all, tell me what rank
shall we give him? What great purity and what real piety must we demand
of him? For consider what manner of hands they ought to be which
minister in these things, and of what kind his tongue which utters such
words, and ought not the soul which receives so great a spirit to be purer
and holier than anything in the world? At such a time angels stand by the
Priest; and the whole sanctuary, and the space round about the altar, is
filled with the powers of heaven, in honor of Him who lieth thereon. For
this, indeed, is capable of being proved from the very rites which are being
then celebrated. I myself, moreover, have heard some one once relate, that

a certain aged, venerable man, accustomed to see revelations, used to tell
him, that he being thought worthy of a vision of this kind, at such a time,
saw, on a sudden, so far as was possible for him, a multitude of angels,
clothed in shining robes, and encircling the altar, and bending down, as one
might see soldiers in the presence of their King, and for my part I believe
it. Moreover another told me, without learning it from some one else, but
as being himself thought worthy to be both an ear and eye witness of it,
that, in the case of those who are about to depart hence, if they happen to
be partakers of the mysteries, with a pure conscience, when they are about
to breathe their last, angels keep guard over them for the sake of what they
have received, and bear them hence. And dost thou not yet tremble to
introduce a soul into so sacred a mystery of this kind, and to advance to
the dignity of the Priesthood, one robed in filthy raiment, whom Christ
has shut out from the rest of the band of guests? The soul of the Priest
should shine like a light beaming over the whole world. But mine has so
great darkness overhanging it, because of my evil conscience, as to be
always cast down and never able to look up with confidence to its Lord.
Priests are the salt of the earth. But who would easily put up with my
lack of understanding, and my inexperience in all things, but thou, who
hast been wont to love me beyond measure. For the Priest ought not only
to be thus pure as one who has been dignified with so high a ministry, but
very discreet, and skilled in many matters, and to be as well versed in the
affairs of this life as they who are engaged in the world, and yet to be free
from them all more than the recluses who occupy the mountains. For since
he must mix with men who have wives, and who bring up children, who
possess servants, and are surrounded with wealth, and fill public
positions, and are persons of influence, he too should be a many-sided
man - I say many-sided, not unreal, nor yet fawning and hypocritical,
but full of much freedom and assurance, and knowing how to adapt
himself profitably, where the circumstances of the case require it, and to
be both kind and severe, for it is not possible to treat all those under one's
charge on one plan, since neither is it well for physicians to apply one
course of treatment to all their sick, nor for a pilot to know but one way of
contending with the winds. For, indeed, continual storms beset this ship of
ours, and these storms do not assail from without only, but take their rise
from within, and there is need of much condescension, and circumspection,

and all these different matters have one end in view, the glory of God, and
the edifying of the Church.

5. Great is the conflict which recluses undergo, and much their toil. But if
any one compare their exertions with those which the right exercise of the
Priesthood involves, he will find the difference as great as the distance
between a king and a commoner. For there, if the labor is great indeed, yet
the conflict is common to body and soul, or rather the greater part of it is
accomplished by the condition of the body, and if this be not strong, the
inclination remains undeveloped, and is unable to come out into action. For
the habit of intense fasting, and sleeping on the ground, and keeping vigil,
and refraining from the bath, and great toil, and all other means which they
use for the affliction of the body are given up, when the body to be thus
disciplined is not strong. But in this case purity of soul is the business in
hand, and no bodily vigor is required to show its excellence. For what does
strength of body contribute towards our being not self-willed, or proud, or
headstrong, but sober and prudent, and orderly, and all else, wherein St.
Paul filled up the picture of the perfect Priest? But no one could say this
of the virtues of the recluse.

6. But as in the case of wonder-workers, a large apparatus is required, both
wheels and ropes and daggers; while the philosopher has the whole of his
art stored up in his mind not requiring any external appliances: So
accordingly in the case before us. The recluse requires both a good
condition of body, and a place suitable for his course of life, in order that
such may not be settled too far from intercourse with their fellow men,
and may have the tranquillity which belongs to desert places, and yet
further, may not fail to enjoy the most favorable climate. For nothing is so
unbearable to a body worn with fastings as a climate which is not equable.
And what trouble they are compelled to take in the preparation of their
clothing and daily food, as they are themselves ambitious of doing all with
their own hands, I need not speak of now. But the Priest will re quire none
of these things to supply his wants, I but is unconcerned about them, and
participates in all things which are harmless, while he has all his skill
stored up in the treasure-house of his mind. But if any one admire a
solitary life, and retirement from the society of the multitude, I should say
myself that such a life was a token of patience, but not a sufficient proof
of entire fortitude of soul. For the man who sits at the helm in harbor, does

not yet give any certain proof of his art. But if one is able to guide his ship
safely in the midst of the sea, no one would deny him to be an excellent
steersman.

7. It would be, therefore, in no wise excessively surprising to us, that the
recluse, living as he does by himself, is undisturbed and does not commit
many and great sins. For he does not meet with things which irritate and
excite his mind. But if any one who has devoted himself to whole
multitudes, and has been compelled to bear the sins of many, has remained
steadfast and firm, guiding his soul in the midst of the storm as if he were
in a calm, he is the man to be justly applauded and admired of all, for he
has shown sufficient proof of personal manliness. Do not thou, therefore,
for thy part wonder if I, who avoid the market-place and the haunts of the
multitude, have not many to accuse me. For I ought not to wonder, if I
sinned not when asleep, nor fell when I did not wrestle, nor was hit if I did
not fight. For who, tell me, who will be able to speak against me, and
reveal my depravity? Can this roof or cell? Nay, they would not be able to
give tongue? Would my mother, who best of all knows my affairs? Well,
certainly with her I am neither in communication, nor have we ever come
to a quarrel, and if this had happened, no mother is so heartless and
wanting in affection for her child as to revile and accuse before all him
whom she travailed with, and brought forth, and reared, if there were no
reason to constrain her, nor any person to urge her to such an act.
Nevertheless, if any one desires to make a careful inspection of my mind,
he will discover much which is corrupt there. Nor art thou unaware of this
who art specially wont to extol me with praises before all. Now that I do
not say these things out of mere modesty, recollect how often I said to
thee, when this subject was being discussed between us, "If any one were
to give me my choice whether I would rather gain distinction in the
oversight of the Church, or in the life of the recluse, I would vote a
thousand times over for accepting the former. For I have never failed to
congratulate those who have been able to discharge this office well, and no
one will gainsay that what I counted blessed I would not have shunned
were I able to take part in it filly. But what am I to do? There is nothing so
prejudicial to the oversight of the Church as this inactivity and negligence
of mine, which others think to be a sort of self-discipline, but which I hold
to be a veil as it were of my personal infirmity, covering the greater

number of my defects and not suffering them to appear. For he who is
accustomed to enjoy such great freedom from business, and to pass his
time in much repose, even if he be of a noble nature, is confused by his
inexperience, and is disturbed, and his inactivity deprives him of no small
part of his natural ability. But when, besides, he is of slow intellect, and
ignorant also of these severe trials, which I take it is my case, he will carry
on this ministry which he has received no better than a statue. Wherefore
of those who have come to such great trial, out of that school, few shine;
and the greater part betray themselves, and fall, and undergo much
hardship and sufferings; and no wonder. For the trials and the discipline
are not concerned with the same things. The man who is contending in no
wise differs from those who are untrained. He who thus enters this list
should despise glory, be superior to anger, full of great discretion. But for
the exercise of these qualities there is no scope in his case who affects a
secluded life. For he does not have many to provoke him in order that he
may practice chastising, the force of his anger: nor admirers and
applauders in order that he may be trained to despise the praises of the
multitudes. And of the discretion which is required in the Church, there is
no taking account in their case. Whenever, therefore, they come to the
trials of which they have never had practical experience, they get
bewildered, their heads are turned, they fall into a state of helplessness,
and besides adding nothing to their excellence, may have often lost that
which they brought with them.

8. BASIL: What then? shall we set over the administration of the Church
those who move in society, and who are careful about the concerns of this
world, who are adepts at wrangling and vituperation, are full of countless
artifices, and versed in luxurious ways?

CHRYSOSTOM: Hush, dear friend that thou art! Thou shouldest never
entertain in thy thoughts such men as these, when the Priesthood is under
discussion, but only such as are able after mixing and associating with all,
to keep their purity undefiled, and their unworldliness, their holiness,
constancy and sobriety unshaken, and to possess all other virtues which
belong to recluses, in a greater degree than they. He who has many defects,
but is able to hide them, by means of his seclusion, and to make them
ineffectual, because he does not associate with any one, when he comes
into society will gain nothing, but the position of a laughing-stock, and will

run greater risks still, which I was very nearly experiencing myself, had
not the providence of God quickly warded off such fire from my head. For
it is not possible for one in such a position to escape notice when he is so
conspicuously placed, but everything then is detected, and as the fire tests
the material of metals, so too the trial of the clerical office searches the
souls of mortal men; and if any one be passionate or mean, or ambitious of
fame, if he be boastful, or anything else of the kind, it unveils all; and
speedily lays bare his defects, and not only lays them bare, but increases
their painfulness and strength. For the wounds of the body, if they are
galled, become harder to heal, and the emotions of the mind when chafed
and irritated, are naturally more exasperated, and those who possess them
are driven to commit greater sins. For they excite him who does not
restrain them, to love of glory, and to boastfulness, and to desire for this
world's goods, and draw him downwards, both to luxury and laxity of life,
and to laziness, and, little by little, to evils worse than these which result
from them. For many are the circumstances in society which have the
power to upset the balance of the mind, and to hinder its straightforward
course; and first of all is his social intercourse with women. For it is not
possible for the Bishop, and one who is concerned with the whole flock,
to have a care for the male portion of it, but to pass over the female, which
needs more particular forethought, because of its propensity to sins. But
the man who is appointed to the administration of a Bishopric must have a
care for the moral health of these, if not in a greater, at least in no less a
degree than the others. For it is necessary to visit them when they are sick,
to comfort them when they are sorrowful, and to reprove them when they
are idle, and to help them when they are distressed; and in such cases the
evil one would find many opportunities of approach, if a man did not
fortify himself with a very strict guard. For the eye, not only of the
unchaste, but of the modest woman pierces and disturbs the mind.
Flatteries enervate it, and favors enslave it, and fervent love - the spring
one may say of all good - becomes the cause of countless evils to those
who do not make a right use of it. Constant cares too have ere now blunted
the edge of the understanding, and have made that which was buoyant
heavier than lead, while anger has burst in like smoke, and taken
possession of all the inner man.

9. Why should any one speak of the injuries that result from grief, the
insults, the abuse, the censure from superiors, from inferiors, from the
wise, and from fools; for the class who are wanting in right judgment are
particularly fond of censuring, and will never readily allow any excuse. But
the truly excellent Bishop ought neither to think lightly of these, but to
clear himself with all men of the charges which they bring against him,
with great forbearance and meekness, pardoning their unreasonable
fault-finding, rather than being indignant and angry about it. For if St. Paul
feared lest he should incur a suspicion of theft, among his disciples, and
therefore procured others for the management of the money, that "no one"
he says, "should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us,
how ought we not to do all so as to remove evil suspicions, even if they
happen to be false, and most unreasonable, and very foreign to our
thought? For we are not so utterly removed from any sin as St. Paul from
theft; notwithstanding, though so far from this evil practice, he did not,
therefore, slight the suspicion of the world, although it was very absurd,
and even insane. For it was madness to have any such suspicion about that
blessed and admirable character. But none the less does he remove far off
the causes of this suspicion, unreasonable though it was, and such as no
one who was in his senses would entertain, and he neither disdained the
folly of the multitudes, nor did he say, "To whose mind did it ever occur
to suspect such things of us, after the signs which I have wrought, and the
forbearance which has marked my life, and when you all revered and
admired us?" Quite the contrary: he foresaw and expected this base
suspicion, and pulled it up by the roots, or rather did not suffer it to grow
at all. Why? "Because," saith he, "we provide things honest not only
before the Lord, but before all men." So great, yea and far greater zeal must
we use, to uproot and prevent floating reports which are not good, but to
see beforehand from afar whence they come, and to remove beforehand the
causes from which they are produced, not to wait till they are established
and are the common topics in every one's mouth. For then it is not easy in
the future to destroy them, but very difficult, perhaps impossible, and not
without mischief, because this is done after many have been injured. But
how far shall I continue pursuing the unattainable? For to enumerate all the
difficulties in this direction, is nothing more nor less than measuring the
ocean. Even when any one should clear himself from every passion (which
is a thing impossible) in order to correct the failings of others, he is forced

to undergo countless trials, and when his own infirmities are added,
behold, an abyss of toil and care, and all that he must suffer, who wishes
to subdue the evils in himself and in those around him.

10. BASIL: And now, art thou free from toils? hast thou no cares while
thou livest by thyself?

CHRYSOSTOM: I have indeed even now. For how is it possible for one
who is a man, and who is living this toilsome life of ours, to be free from
cares and conflict? But it is not quite the same thing for man to plunge into
a boundless ocean and to cross a river, so great is the difference between
these cares and those. For now, indeed, if I were able to become
serviceable to others, I should wish it myself, and this would be a matter
of prayer with me. But if it is not possible to help another, yet if it be
practicable to save and rescue myself from the waves, I shall be contented.

BASIL: Dost thou then think this to be a great thing? and dost thou fancy
that thou wilt be saved when thou art not profitable to any other?

CHRYSOSTOM: Thou hast spoken well and nobly, for I am not myself
able to believe that it is possible for one who has not labored for the
salvation of his fellow to be saved, nor did it at all profit the wretched man
in the Gospel that he had not diminished his talent; but he perished
through not increasing it and bringing it doubled to his master.
Nevertheless, I think that my punishment will be milder when I am called
to account, because I have not saved others, than it would be if I should
destroy myself and others too by becoming far worse after so great an
honor. For now I trust that my chastisement will be proportioned to the
amount of my sins, but after receiving this office, I fear it would be not
double, or threefold, but manifold, because I should have caused very
many to stumble, and after additional honor should have offended the God
who honored me.

11. For this very cause God accuses the Israelites more vehemently, and
shows that they were worthy of greater chastisement, because they sinned
after so many honors had come to them from Him, saying in one place:
"But you only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore will I
punish you for your iniquities," and again, "and I raised up of your sons
for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites; and before the times

of the prophets, wishing to show that sins receive sorer punishment by far
when they occur in the case of the Priest than in the case of the laity, He
enjoins as great a sacrifice to be offered for the Priest as for the whole
people, and this amounts to a proof on his part, that the wounds of the
Priesthood need more assistance - that is, as great as those of all the
people together, and they would not have needed a greater, except they
were worse; and they are not worse in their nature, but are aggravated
through the dignity of the Priest, who dares to commit them. And why do
I speak of the men who follow this ministration. For the daughters of the
Priests, who have no part in the Priestly office, yet on account of their
father's dignity undergo a far bitterer punishment for the same sins as
others, and the offense is the same in their case and in the daughters of the
laity; namely, fornication in both; yet the penalty is far severer for the
former. Dost thou see with what abundant proof God shows thee that he
demands much greater punishment for the ruler than for the ruled? For no
doubt he who punishes to a greater degree than others the daughter of a
certain man for that man's sake, will not exact the same penalty from the
man who is the cause of her additional chastisement as from others, but a
much heavier one; and very reasonably; for the mischief does not merely
involve himself, but it destroys the souls of the weaker brethren and of
them who look up to him, and Ezekiel, writing to show this, distinguishes
from one another the judgment of the rams and of the sheep.

12. Do we then seem to thee to entertain a reasonable fear? for in addition
to what has been said, although much toil is needful on my part, so that I
should not be completely overwhelmed by the passions of my soul, yet I
endure the toil, and I do not shun the conflict. For even now I am taken
captive by vainglory, but I often recover myself, and I see at a glance that I
have been taken, and there are times when I rebuke my soul, which has
been enslaved; outrageous desires even now come over me, but they kindle
only a languid flame, since in bodily eves cannot fasten upon any fuel to
feed the fire. From speaking ill of any, or from hearing any one evil spoken
of, I am utterly removed, since I have no one to talk with; for surely these
walls would never give tongue; yet it is not altogether in like manner
possible to avoid anger, although there be none to provoke it. For often
when the recollection of outrageous men has come over me, and of the
deeds done by them, it makes my heart swell. But not permanently, for I

quickly subdue its kindling, and persuade it to be quiet, saying that it is
very inexpedient and extremely despicable to leave one's own fault alone,
and to busy one's self about the faults of one's neighbors. But were I to
come among the multitude, and to be involved in countless excitements, I
should not be able to have the benefit of this warning, nor to experience
reflections which take me thus to task. But just as they who are driven
over precipices by a torrent, or in some other way, are able to foresee the
destruction to which they are finally going, and are unable to think of any
means of help, so I, when I have fallen into the great tumult of my
passions, shall be able to see at a glance my chastisement daily increasing.
But to be master of myself as I am now, and to rebuke diseases of this sort
raging on every side, would not be equally easy for me as it was before.
For my soul is weak and puny, and easily mastered, not only by these
passions, but by envy, which is bitterer than all of them. Neither does it
know how to bear insults or honors temperately. But these do exceedingly
elate it, while those depress it. As, then, savage wild beasts, when they are
in good condition, and in full vigor, overcome those that fight with them,
particularly, too, if they be feeble and unskillful; but if any one were to
weaken them by starvation, he will put their rage to sleep, and will
extinguish most of their strength; so that one, not over valiant, might take
up the conflict and battle with them: so also with the passions of the soul.
He who makes them weak, places them in subjection to right reason; but
he who nourishes them carefully, makes his battle with them harder, and
renders them so formidable that he passes all his time in bondage and fear.

What then is the food of these wild beasts? Of vainglory, indeed, it is
honors and applause; of pride, abundance of authority and power; of
envy, the reputation of one's neighbors; of avarice, the munificence of the
generous; of incontinence, luxury and the constant society of women; and
other passions have their proper nutriment? And all these things will
sorely attack me if I come forth into the world, and will tear my soul to
pieces, will be the more formidable and will make my battle with them the
harder. Whereas, while I am established here they will be subdued; and
then, indeed, only with great exertion; yet at the same time, by the Grace
of God, they will be subdued, and there will not be anything worse then
than their bark. For these reasons I keep to this cell, and am inaccessible,
self-contained, and unsociable, and I put up with hearing countless

complaints of this kind, although I would gladly efface them, and have
been vexed and grieved because I cannot; for it is not easy for me to
become sociable, and at the same time to remain in my present security.
Therefore I beseech thee, too, to pity rather than to censure one beset with
such great difficulty.

But we cannot yet persuade thee. Accordingly the time is now come that I
should utter to thee the only thing which I have left spoken. Perhaps it
may seem to many to be incredible, but even so I shall not be ashamed to
bring it before the world, for though what is said is proof of an evil
conscience and of many sins, yet, since God, who is about to judge us,
knows all accurately, what gain will result to us from the ignorance of
men? What then is this, which is yet unspoken? From that day on which
thou didst impart to me the suspicion of the bishopric, my whole system
has often been in danger of being completely unhinged, such was the fear,
such the despondency which seized my soul; for on considering the glory
of the Bride of Christ, the holiness, the spiritual beauty and wisdom, and
comeliness, and then reckoning up my own faults, I used not to cease
bewailing both her and myself, and amidst continual distress and
perplexity, I kept saying - who then made such a suggestion as this?
why has the Church of God made so great a mistake? why has she so
provoked her Master, as to be delivered over to me, the unworthiest of all
men, and to undergo such great disgrace? Considering these things often by
myself, and being unable to bear the thought of so monstrous a thing, I
used to be like thunderstruck people, speechless, and unable either to see
or hear. And when this condition of great helplessness left me, for there
were times when it passed off, tears and despondency succeeded to it, and
after the flood of tears, then fear again, entered in their stead, disturbing,
confusing and agitating my mind. In such a tempest I used to pass the time
that is gone; but thou wast ignorant of it, and thoughtest that I was
spending my time in a perfect tranquillity, but I will now try and unveil to
thee the storm of my soul, for it may be thou wilt henceforth pardon me,
abandoning your accusations. How then shall I unveil this to thee? For if
thou wouldest see this clearly, it is not otherwise possible than by laying
bare my own heart; but as this is impossible, I will try and show you as
well as I can, by a certain faint illustration, the gloom of my despondency,
and from this image please to infer my condition.

Let us suppose that the daughter of the King of all the earth under the sun
is the betrothed of a certain man, and that this damsel has matchless
beauty, transcending that of human nature, and that in this respect she
outstrips by a long distance the whole race of women; also that she has
virtues of the soul, so great as to distance by a long way the whole
generation of men that have been, or that shall be; and that the grace of her
manners transcends all Standards of art, and that the loveliness of her
person is eclipsed by the beauty of her countenance; and that her
betrothed, not only for the sake of these things, is enamored of the maiden,
but apart from these things has an affection for her, and by his ardor
throws into the shade the most passionate of lovers that ever were. Then
let us suppose, whilst he is burning with love, he hears from some quarter
that some mean, abject man, low born, and crippled in body, in fact a
thoroughly bad fellow, was about to wed this wondrous, well-beloved
maiden. Have we then presented to thee some small portion of our grief?
and is it enough to stay my illustration at this point? So far as my
despondency is concerned, I think it is enough; for this was the only
purpose for which I introduced the comparison, but that I may show you
the measure of my fear, and my terror, let me proceed to another
description.

Let there be an armament composed of infantry, cavalry, and marines, and
let a number of triremes cover the sea, and phalanxes of foot and horse
cover most of the plains, and the ridges of the mountains, and let the metal
of their armor reflect the sunshine, and the glitter of the helmets and
shields be reflected by the beams which are emitted from them; let the
clashing of spears and the neighing of horses be born up to the very
heavens, and let neither sea nor land appear, but only brass and iron in
every direction. Let the enemy be drawn up in battle array opposite to
these, fierce and savage men, and let the time of the engagement be now at
hand. Then let some one suddenly seize some young lad, one of those
brought up in the country, knowing nothing but the use of the shepherd's
pipe and crook; let him be clad in brazen armor, and let him be led round
the whole camp and be shown the squadrons and their officers, the
archers, slingers, captains, generals, the foot and horse, the spearmen, the
triremes and their commanders, the dense mass of soldiers in the ships,
and the multitude of engines of war lying ready on board. Let him be

shown, moreover, the whole array of the enemy, their repulsive aspect,
and the varied stores and unusual quantity of their arms; the ravines also
and precipices of the mountains, deep and difficult. Let him be shown
further on the enemies' side, horses flying by some enchantment and
infantry born through the air, and sorcery of every power and form; and
let him consider the calamities of war, the cloud of spears, the hailstorm of
arrows, that rest mist and obscurity that gloomiest night which the
multitude of weapons occasions, eclipsing the sunbeams with their cloud,
the dust no less than the darkness baffling the eyesight. The torrents of
blood, the groanings of the falling, the shouts of the surviving, the heaps of
slain, wheels bathed in blood, horses with their riders thrown headlong
down, owing to the number of corpses, the ground a scene of general
confusion, blood, and bows, and arrows, hoofs of horses and heads of men
lying together, a human arm and a chariot wheel and a helmet, a breast
pierced through, brains sticking to swords, the point of a dart broken off
with an eye transfixed upon it. Then let him reckon up the sufferings of
the naval force, the triremes burning in the midst of the waves, and sinking
with their armed crews, the roaring of the sea, the tumult of the sailors, the
shout of the soldiers, the foam of the waves mixed with blood, and dashing
over into all the ships; the corpses on the decks, some sinking, some
floating, some cast upon the beach, overwhelmed by the waves, and
obstructing the passage of the ships. And when he has been carefully
instructed in all the tragedy of warfare, let the horrors of captivity and of
slavery be added to it, worse than any kind of death; and having told him
all this, bid him mount his horse straightway, and take command of all that
armament.

Dost thou really think that this lad would be equal to more than the mere
description, and would not, at the very first glance, lose heart?

13. Do not think that I have exaggerated the matter by my account, nor
suppose that because we are shut up in this body, as in some prison
house, and are unable to see anything of the invisible world, that what has
been said is overstated. For thou wouldest see a far greater and more
formidable conflict than this, couldest thou ever behold, with these eyes of
thine, the devil's most gloomy battle array, and his frantic onset. For there
is no brass or iron there. No horses, or chariots or wheels, no fire and
darts. These are visible things. But there are other much more fearful

engines than these. One does not need against these enemies breastplate or
shield, sword and spear, yet the sight only of this accursed array is enough
to paralyze the soul, unless it happen to be very noble, and to enjoy in a
high degree as a protection to its own courage the providential care of God.
And if it were possible by putting off this body, or still keeping it, to see
clearly and fearlessly with the naked eye the whole of his battle array, and
his warfare against us, thou wouldest see no torrents of blood, nor dead
bodies, but so many fallen souls, and such disastrous wounds that the
whole of that description of warfare which I just now detailed to thee thou
wouldest think to be mere child's sport and pastime rather than war: so
many are there smitten every day, and the wounds in the two cases do not
bring about the same death, but as great as is the difference between the
soul from the body, so great is the difference between that death and this.
For when the soul receives a wound, and falls, it does not lie as a lifeless
body, but it is thenceforth tormented, being gnawed by an evil conscience;
and after its removal hence, at the time of judgment, it is delivered over to
eternal punishment; and if any one be without grief in regard to the
wounds given by the devil, his danger becomes the greater for his
insensibility. For whoever is not pained by the first wound, will readily
receive a second, and after that a third. For the unclean spirit will not cease
assaulting to the last breath, whenever he finds a soul supine and
indifferent to his first wounds; and if thou wouldest inquire into the
method of attack, thou wouldest find this much more severe and varied.
For no one ever knew so many forms of craft and deceit as that unclean
spirit. By this indeed, he has acquired the greater part of his power, nor
can any one have so implacable a hatred against his worst enemies as the
evil one against the human race. And if any one inquire into the vehemence
with which he fights, here again it would be ludicrous to bring men into
comparison with him. But if any one choose out the fiercest and most
savage of beasts, and is minded to set their fury against his, he will find
that they were meek and quiet in comparison, such rage does he breathe
forth when he attacks our souls; and the period of the warfare indeed in
the former case is brief, and in this brief space there are respites; for the
approach of the night and the fatigue of slaughter, meal-times also, and
many other things, afford a respite to the soldier, so that he can doff his
armor and breathe a little, and refresh himself with food and drink, and in
many other ways recover his former strength. But in the case of the evil

one it is not possible ever to lay aside one's armor, it is not possible even
to take sleep, for one who would remain always unscathed. For one of two
things must be: either to fall and perish unarmed, or to stand equipped and
ever watchful. For he ever stands with his own battle array, watching for
our indolence, and laboring more zealously for our destruction, than we for
our salvation.

And that he is not seen by us, and suddenly assails us, which things are a
source of countless evils to those who are not always on the watch,
proves this kind of war to be harder than the other. Couldest thou wish us,
then, in such a case to command the soldiers of Christ? yea, this were to
command them for the devil's service, for whenever he who ought to
marshal and order others is the most inexperienced and feeble of all men,
by betraying through this inexperience those who have been entrusted to
his charge, he commands them in the devil's interests rather than in
Christ's.

But why dost thou sigh? why weep? For my ease does not now call for
wailing, but for joy and gladness.

BASIL: But not my case, yea this calls for countless lamentations. For I
am hardly able yet to understand to what degree of evil thou hast brought
me. For I came to thee wanting to learn what excuse I should make on thy
behalf to those who find fault with thee; but thou sendest me back after
putting another case in the place of that I had. For I am no longer
concerned about the excuses I shall give them on thy behalf, but what
excuse I shall make to God for myself and my own faults. But I beseech
thee, and implore thee, if my welfare is at all regarded by thee, if there be
any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any bowels, and
mercies, for thou knowest that thyself above all hast brought me into this
danger, stretch forth thine hand, both saying and doing what is able to
restore me, do not have the heart to leave me for the briefest moment, but
now rather than before let me pass my life with thee.

CHRYSOSTOM: But I smiled, and said, how shall I be able to help, how
to profit thee under so great a burden of office? But since this is pleasant
to thee, take courage, dear soul, for at any time at which it is possible for
thee to have leisure amid thine own cares, I will come and will comfort
thee, and nothing shall be wanting of what is in my power.

On this, he weeping yet more, rose up. But I, having embraced him and
kissed his head, led him forth, exhorting him to bear his lot bravely. For I
believe, said I, that through Christ who has called thee, and set thee over
his own sheep, thou wilt obtain such assurance from this ministry as to
receive me also, if I am in danger at the last day, into thine everlasting
tabernacle.

ST. CHRYSOSTOM:

AN EXHORTATION TO
THEODORE AFTER HIS FALL

TRANSLATED WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY

REV. W. R. W, STEPHENS, M.A,

PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER, AND RECTOR OF
WOOLBEDING, SUSSEX.

INTRODUCTION TO THE LETTERS TO THEODORE

THESE two letters, which are the earliest of Chrysostom's extant works,
are addressed to a friend who had been a member of the little ascetic
brotherhood which Chrysostom and Basil formed, soon after they had
abandoned secular life, as described in the first book of the Treatise on the
Priesthood. Theodore, like Maximus, afterwards Bishop of Isaurian
Seleucia, who was another member of the same fraternity, had been a
fellow student with Chrysostom and Basil in the school of Libanius, but
was a few years younger than either of them. The strain upon his powers
of religious devotion had proved too much for him; he had withdrawn from
the ascetic brotherhood, and relapsed for a season into worldly habits,
being fascinated by the beauty of a young lady named Hermione, whom he
was anxious to marry. His fall was regarded with almost as much sorrow
and dismay by his austere friends as if he had plunged into deadly vice.
Prayers were continually offered, and great efforts made for his
restoration, amongst which must be reckoned the two letters which are
here translated. They are the productions of a youthful enthusiast, and as
such allowances must be made for them; but they abound in passages of
great beauty and power, especially upon the infinite love and forbearance
of God, as encouraging to repentance and withholding from despair and
recklessness into which Theodore seems to have been inclined to sink. The
appeal of Chrysostom, combined with the efforts of his other friends, was
not in vain. Theodore once more renounced the world and his matrimonial
intentions, and retired into the seclusion of the fraternity. In A.D. 383,
when he was about thirty-three years of age, he was ordained priest, and
in 392 he became Bishop of Mopsuestia, where he died in A.D. 428 at the
age of seventy-eight. Chrysostom seems to have retained his affection to
him to the last, and during his own exile at Cucusus, A.D. 404-7, wrote a
letter to him which is full of expressions of fervent admiration and regard.
He was a most voluminous writer, and may be regarded as the ablest
representative of the school of Biblical interpretation founded by
Diodorus of Tarsus, under whom he had studied, together with
Chrysostom and Basil. A fierce controversy raged during the fifth and
sixth centuries respecting the orthodoxy of some of his writings which
some accused of preparing the way for Nestorianism. When this had died

down his name was comparatively forgotten, and it is only in modern
times that his great merits as a commentator, who boldly applied the
historical and grammatical methods of examination to the books of Holy
Scripture, have been fully recognized.

Tillemont was of opinion that of the two letters of Chrysostom the
second only was addressed to Theodore, who was afterwards Bishop of
Mopsuestia. Montfaucon, however, Dupin, and Savile, maintain that both
were addressed to him, and their view is confirmed by the fact that
Leontius of Byzantium (in Nest. et. Eutych. lib. in. c. 7) and Isidore of
Seville (de Script. Eccl. c. 6.) mention two letters of Chrysostom to
Theodore of Mopsuestia.

AN EXHORTATION TO
THEODORE AFTER HIS FALL

LETTER 1

"OH! that my head were water, and mine eyes a fountain of tears!" it is
seasonable for me to utter these words now, yea much more than for the
prophet in his time. For although I am not about to mourn over many
cities, or whole nations, yet shall I mourn over a soul which is of equal
value with many such nations, yea even more precious. For if one man
who does the will of God is better than ten thousand transgressors, then
thou wast formerly better than ten thousand Jews. Wherefore no one
would now blame me if I were to compose more lamentations than those
which are contained in the prophet, and to utter complaints yet more
vehement. For it is not the overthrow of a city which I mourn, nor the
captivity of wicked then, but the desolation of a sacred soul, the
destruction and effacement of a Christ-bearing temple. For would not any
one who knew in the days of its glory that well-ordered mind of thine
which the devil has now set on fire, groan, imitating the lamentation of the
prophet; when he hears that barbarian hands have defiled the holy of
holies, and have set fire to all things and burned them up, the cherubim, the
ark, the mercy seat, the tables of stone, the golden pot? For this calamity
is bitterer, yea bitterer than that, in proportion as the pledges deposited in
thy soul were far more precious than those. This temple is holier than
that; for it glistened not with gold and silver, but with the grace of the
Spirit, and in place of the ark and the cherubim, it had Christ, and His
Father, and the Paraclete seated within. But now all is changed, and the
temple is desolate, and bare of its former beauty and comeliness,
unadorned with its divine and unspeakable adornments, destitute of all
security and protection; it has neither door nor bolt, and is laid open to all
manner of soul-destroying and shameful thoughts; and if the thought of
arrogance or fornication, or avarice, or any more accursed than these, wish
to enter in there is no one to hinder them; whereas formerly, even as the

Heaven is inaccessible to all these, so also was the purity of thy soul.
Now perhaps I shall seem to say what is incredible to some who now
witness thy desolation and overthrow; for on this account I wail and
mourn, and shall not cease doing so, until I see thee again established in
thy former luster. For although this seems to be impossible to men, yet to
God all things are possible. For it is He "who raiseth the poor from the
earth, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set him with the
princes, even with the princes of his people." It is He "who makes the
barren woman to dwell at home, a mother rejoicing over her children." Do
not then despair of the most perfect change. For if the devil had such great
power as to cast thee down from that pinnacle and height of virtue into the
extremity of evil doing, much more will God be able to draw thee up again
to thy former confidence; and not only indeed to make you what you were
before, but even much happier. Only be not downcast, nor fling away
good hopes, nor fall into the condition of the ungodly. For it is not the
multitude of sins which is wont to plunge men into despair, but impiety of
soul. Therefore Solomon did not make the unqualified statement "every
one who has entered into the den of the wicked, despiseth;" but only "he
who is ungodly." For it is such persons only who are affected in this way
when they have entered the den of the wicked. And this it is which does
not suffer them to look up, and re-ascend to the position from which they
fell. For this accursed thought pressing down like some yoke upon the
neck of the soul, and so forcing it to stoop, hinders it from looking up to
the Master. Now it is the part of a brave and excellent man to break this
yoke in pieces, to shake off the tormentor fastened upon him; and to utter
the words of the prophet, "As the eyes of a maiden look unto the hands of
her mistress, even so our eyes look unto the Lord our God until He have
mercy upon us. Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us, for we
have been utterly filled with contempt." Truly divine are these precepts,
and decrees of the highest form of spiritual wisdom. We have been filled, it
is said, with contempt, and have undergone countless distresses;
nevertheless we shall not desist from looking up to God, neither shall we
cease praying to him until He has received our petition. For this is the
mark of a noble soul, not to be cast down, nor be dismayed at the
multitude of the calamities which oppress it, nor to withdraw, after
praying many times without success, but to persevere, until He have
mercy upon us, even as the blessed David saith.

2. For the reason why the devil plunges us into thoughts of despair is that
he may cut off the hope which is towards God, the safe anchor, the
foundation of our life, the guide of the way which leads to heaven, the
salvation of perishing souls. "For by hope" it is said, "we are saved." For
this assuredly it is which, like some strong cord suspended from the
heavens, supports our souls, gradually drawing towards that world on high
those who cling firmly to it, and lifting them above the tempest of the evils
of this life. If any one then becomes enervated, and lets go this sacred
anchor, straightway he falls down, and is suffocated, having entered into
the abyss of wickedness. And the Evil One knowing this, when he
perceives that we are ourselves oppressed by the consciousness of evil
deeds, steps in himself and lays upon us the additional burden, heavier
than lead, of anxiety arising from despair; and if we accept it, it follows of
necessity that we are forthwith dragged down by the weight, and having
been parted from that cord, descend into the depth of misery where thou
thyself art now, having forsaken the commandments of the meek and
lowly Master and executing all the injunctions of the cruel tyrant, and
implacable enemy of our salvation; having broken in pieces the easy yoke,
and cast away the light burden, and having put on the iron collar instead of
these things, yea, having hung the ponderous millstone from thy neck.
Where then canst thou find a footing henceforth when thou art submerging
thy unhappy soul, imposing on thyself this necessity of continually
sinking downwards? Now the woman who had found the one coin called
her neighbors to share her joy; saying, "Rejoice with me;" but I shall now
invoke all friends, both mine and thine, for the contrary purpose, saying
not "Rejoice with me" but "Mourn with me," and take up the same strain
of mourning, and utter the same cry of distress with me. For the worst
possible loss has befallen me, not that some given number of talents of
gold, or some large quantity of precious stones have dropped out of my
hand, but that he who was more precious than all these things, who was
sailing over this same sea, this great and broad sea with me, has, I know
not how, slipped overboard, and fallen into the very pit of destruction.

3. Now if any should attempt to divert me from mourning, I shall reply to
them in the words of the prophet, saying "Let me alone, I will weep
bitterly; labor not to comfort me." For the mourning with which I mourn
now is not of a kind to subject me to condemnation for excess in

lamentation, but the cause is one for which even Paul, or Peter, had they
been here, would not have been ashamed to weep and mourn, and reject all
kinds of consolation. For those who bewail that death which is common to
all one might reasonably accuse of much feebleness of spirit; but when in
place of a corpse a dead soul lies before us, pierced with innumerable
wounds, and yet even in its death manifesting its former natural
comeliness, and health, and beauty now extinguished, who can be so harsh
and unsympathetic as to utter words of encouragement in place of wailing
and lamentation? For as in the other world the absence of mourning is a
mark of divine wisdom, so in this world the act of mourning is a mark of
the same. He who had already mounted to the sky, who was laughing to
scorn the vanity of this life, who regarded bodily beauty no more than if it
had been in forms of stone, who despised gold as it had been mud, and
every kind of luxury as mire, even he, having been suddenly overwhelmed
with the feverish longing of a preposterous passion, has ruined his health,
and manly strength, and the bloom of his youth, and become a slave of
pleasure. Shall we not weep then, I pray you, for such a man and bewail
him, until we have got him back again? And where do these things concern
the human soul? It is not possible indeed to discover in this world the
means of release from the death of the body, and yet even this does not
stay the mourners from lamenting; but only in this world is it possible to
bring to naught the death of the soul. "For in Hades" we read, "who will
confess thee?" Is it not then the height of stupidity that they who mourn
the death of the body should do this so earnestly, although they know that
they will not raise the dead man to life by their lamentation; but that we
should not manifest anything of the kind, and this when we know that
often there is hope of conducting the lost soul back to its former life? For
many both now and in the days of our forefathers, having been perverted
from the right position, and fallen headlong out of the straight path, have
been so completely restored as to eclipse their former deeds by the latter,
and to receive the prize, and be wreathed with the garland of victory, and
be proclaimed among the conquerors, and be numbered in the company of
the saints. For as long as any one stands in the furnace of pleasures, even
if he has countless examples of this kind before him, the thing seems to
him to be impossible; but if he once gets a short start upon the way out
from thence, by continually advancing he leaves the fiercer part of the fire
behind him and will see the parts which are in front of him, and before his

footsteps full of dew and much refreshment; only let us not despair or
grow weary of the return; for he who is so affected, even if he has acquired
boundless power and zeal, has acquired it to no purpose. For when he has
once shut the door of repentance against himself, and has blocked the
entrance into the race-course, how will he be able while he abides outside
to accomplish any good thing, either small or great? On this account the
Evil One uses all kinds of devices in order to plant in us this thought (of
despair); for (if he succeeds) he will no longer have to sweat and toil in
contending with us; how should he, when we are prostrate and fallen, and
unwilling to resist him? For he who has been able to slip out of this chain,
will recover his own strength and will not cease struggling against the devil
to his last gasp, and even if he had countless other falls, he will get up
again, and will smite his enemy; but he who is in, bondage to the
cogitations of despair, and has unstrung his own strength, how will he be
able to prevail, and to resist, having on the contrary taken to flight?

4. And speak not to me of those who have committed small sins, but
suppose the case of one who is filled full of all wickedness, and let him
practice everything which excludes him from the kingdom, and let us
suppose that this man is not one of those who were unbelievers from the
beginning, but formerly belonged to the believers, and such as were well
pleasing to God, but afterwards has become a fornicator, adulterer,
effeminate, a thief, a drunkard, a sodomite, a reviler, and everything else of
this kind; I will not approve even of this man despairing of himself,
although he may have gone on to extreme old age in the practice of this
great and unspeakable wickedness. For if the wrath of God were a passion,
one might well despair as being unable to quench the flame which he had
kindled by so many evil doings; but since the Divine nature is passionless,
even if He punishes, even if He takes vengeance, he does this not with
wrath, but with tender care, and much loving-kindness; wherefore it
behooves us to be of much good courage, and to trust in the power of
repentance. For even those who have sinned against Him He is not wont
to visit with punishment for His own sake; for no harm can traverse that
divine nature; but He acts with a view to our advantage, and to prevent our
perverseness becoming worse by our making a practice of despising and
neglecting Him. For even as one who places himself outside the light
inflicts no loss on the light, but the greatest upon himself being shut up in

darkness; even so he who has become accustomed to despise that almighty
power, does no injury to the power, but inflicts the greatest possible
injury upon himself. And for this reason God threatens us with
punishments, and often inflicts them, not as avenging Himself, but by way
of attracting us to Himself. For a physician also is not distressed or vexed
at the insults of those who are out of their minds, but yet does and
contrives everything for the purpose of stopping those who do such
unseemly acts, not looking to his own interests but to their profit; and if
they manifest some small degree of self-control and sobriety he rejoices
and is glad, and applies his remedies much more earnestly, not as revenging
himself upon them for their former conduct, but as wishing to increase
their advantage, and to bring them back to a purely sound state of health.
Even so God when we fall into the very extremity of madness, says and
does everything, not by way of avenging Himself on account of our former
deeds; but because He wishes to release us from our disorder; and by
means of right reason it is quite possible to be convinced of this.

5. Now if any one should dispute with us concerning these things we will
confirm them out of the divine oracles. For who, I ask, became more
depraved than the king of the Babylonians, who after having received such
great experience of God's power as to make obeisance to His prophet, and
command offerings and incense to be sacrificed to Him was again carried
away to his former pride, and cast bound into the furnace those who did
not honor himself before God. Nevertheless this man who was so cruel
and impious, and rather a beast than a human being, God invited to
repentance, and granted him several opportunities of conversion, first of
all the miracle which took place in the furnace, and after that the vision
which the king saw but which Daniel interpreted, a vision sufficient to
bend even a heart of stone; and in addition to these things after the
exhortation derived from events the prophet also himself advised him,
saying "Therefore, O king, let my counsel please thee, and redeem thy sins
by alms, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; it may be that
long suffering will be shown to thy offense." What sayest thou O wise and
blessed man? After so great a fall is there again a way of return? and after
so great a disease is health possible? and after so great a madness is there
again a hope of soundness of mind? The king has deprived himself
beforehand of all hope, first of all by having ignored Him who created him;

and conducted him to this honor, although he had many evidences of His
power and forethought to recount which occurred both in his own case and
in the case of his forefathers; but after this again when he had received
distinct tokens of God's wisdom and foreknowledge, and had seen magic,
and astronomy and the theater of the whole satanic system of jugglery
overthrown, he exhibited deeds yet worse than the former. For things
which the wise magi, the Gazarenes, could not explain, but confessed that
they were beyond human nature, these a captive youth having caused to
be solved for him, so moved him by that miracle that he not only himself
believed, but also became to the whole world a clear herald and teacher of
this doctrine. Wherefore if even before having received such a token it was
unpardonable in him to ignore God, much more so was it after that miracle,
and his confession, and the teaching which was extended to others. For if
he had not honestly believed that He was the only true God he would not
have shown such honor to His servant, or have laid down such laws for
others. But yet after making this kind of confession, he again lapsed into
idolatry, and he who once fell on his face and made obeisance to the
servant of God, broke out into such a pitch of madness, as to cast into the
furnace the servants of God who did not make obeisance to himself. What
then? did God visit the apostate, as he deserved to be visited? No! He
supplied him with greater tokens of His own power, drawing him back
again after so great a display of arrogance to his former condition; and,
what is yet more wonderful, that owing to the abundance of the miracles
he might not again disbelieve what was done, the subject upon which He
wrought the sign was none other than the furnace which the king himself
kindled for the children whom he bound and cast therein. Even to
extinguish the flame would have been a wonderful and strange thing; but
the benign Deity in order to inspire him with greater fear, and increase his
dismay, and undo all his hardness of heart, did what was greater and
stranger than this. For, permitting the furnace to be kindled to as high a
pitch as he desired, He then exhibited his own peculiar power, not by
putting down the devices of his enemies, but by frustrating them when
they were set on foot. And, to prevent any one who saw them survive the
flame from supposing that it was a vision, He suffered those who cast
them in to be burned, thus proving that the thing seen was really fire; for
otherwise it would not have devoured naphtha and tow, and fagots and
such a large number of bodies; but nothing is stronger than His command;

but the nature of all existing things obeys Him who brought them into
being out of nothing; which was just what He manifested at that time; for
the flame having received perishable bodies, held aloof from them as if
they had been imperishable, and restored in safety, with the addition of
much luster, the deposit entrusted to it. For like kings from some royal
court, even so did those children come forth from the furnace, no one
having the patience to look any longer at the king, but all transferring their
eyes from him to the strange spectacle, and neither the diadem nor the
purple robe, nor any other feature of royal pomp, attracted the multitudes
of unbelievers so much as the sight of those faithful ones, who tarried long
in the fire, and then came out of it as men might have done who had
undergone this in a dream. For the most fragile of all our features, I mean
the hair, prevailed more mightily than adamant against the all-devouring
flame. And the fact that when they were cast into the midst of the fire
they suffered no harm was not the only wonder, but the further fact that
they were speaking the whole time. Now all who have witnessed persons
burning are aware, that if they keep their lips fast closed, they can hold
out for a short time at least against the conflagration; but if any one
chances to open his mouth, the soul instantly takes its flight from the
body. Nevertheless after such great miracles had taken place, and all who
were present and beheld were amazed, and those who were absent had
been informed of the fact by means of letters, the king who instructed
others remained himself without amendment, and went back again to his
former wickedness. And yet even then God did not punish him, but was
still long-suffering, counseling him both by means of visions and by His
prophet. But when he was not made anywise better by any of these
things, then at last God inflicted punishment upon him, not by way of
avenging himself on account of his former deeds, but as cutting off the
occasion of future evils, and checking the advance of wickedness, and He
did not inflict even this permanently, but after having chastised him for a
few years, He restored him again to his former honor, without having
suffered any loss from his punishment, but on the contrary having gained
the greatest possible good; a firm hold upon faith in God, and repentance
on account of his former misdeeds.

6. For such is the loving-kindness of God; He never turns his face away
from a sincere repentance, but if any one has pushed on to the very

extremity of wickedness, and chooses to return thence towards the path of
virtue, God accepts and welcomes, and does everything so as to restore
him to his former position. And He does what is yet more merciful; for
even should any one not manifest complete repentance, he does not pass
by one which is small and insignificant, but assigns a great reward even to
this; which is evident from what Esaias the prophet says concerning the
people of the Jews, speaking on this wise: "On account of his sin I put
him to pain for a little while, and smote him, and turned my face away
from him, and he was pained, and walked sorrowfully, and then I healed
him, and comforted him." And we might cite as another witness that most
ungodly king, who was given over to sin by the influence of his wife: yet
when he only sorrowed, and put on sackcloth, and condemned his
offenses, he so won for himself the mercy of God, as to be released from
all the evils which were impending over him. For God said to Elias "Seest
thou how Ahab is pricked in the heart before my face? I will not bring the
evil upon him in his own days, because he hath wept before me." And
after this again, Manasses, having exceeded all in fury and tyranny, and
having subverted the legal form of worship, and shut up the temple, and
caused the deceit of idolatry to flourish, and having become more ungodly
than all who were before him, when he afterwards repented, was ranked
amongst the friends of God. Now if, looking to the magnitude of his own
iniquities, he had despaired of restoration and repentance, he would have
missed all which he afterwards obtained: but as it was, looking to the
boundlessness of God's tender mercy instead of the enormity of his
transgressions, and having broken in sunder the bonds of the devil, he rose
up and contended with him, and finished the good course. And not only
by what was done to these men, but also by the words of the prophet
does God destroy the counsels of despair, speaking. on this wise: "Today,
if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
Now that expression "today," may be uttered at every time of life, even
on the verge of old age, if you desire it: for repentance is judged not by
quantity of time, but by disposition of the soul. For the Ninevites did not
need many days to blot out their sin, but the short space of one day
availed to efface all their iniquity: and the robber also did not take a long
time to effect his entrance into Paradise, but in such a brief moment as one
might occupy in uttering a single word, did he wash off all the sins which
he had committed in his whole life, and received the prize bestowed by the

divine approval even before the Apostles. And we also see the martyrs
obtain glorious crowns for themselves in the course, not of many years,
but of a few days, and often in a single day only.

7. Wherefore we have need of zeal in every direction, and much
preparation of mind: and if we so order our conscience as to hate our
former wickedness, and choose the contrary path with as much energy as
God desires and commands we shall not have anything less on account of
the short space of time: many at least who were last have far outstripped
those who were first. For to have fallen is not a grievous thing, but to
remain prostrate after falling, and not to get up again; and, playing the
coward and the sluggard, to conceal feebleness of moral purpose under the
reasoning of despair. To whom also the prophet spoke in perplexity
saying "Doth he who falleth not rise up, or he who turneth away not turn
back?" But if you inquire of me for instances of persons who have fallen
away after having believed, all these things have been said with reference
to such persons, for he who has fallen belonged formerly to those who
were standing, not to those who were prostrate; for how should one in
that condition fall? But other things also shall be said, partly by means of
parables, partly by plainer deeds and words. Now that sheep which had
got separated from the ninety and nine, and then was brought back again,
represents to us nothing else than the fall and return of the faithful; for it
was a sheep not of some alien flock, but belonging to the same number as
the rest, and was for merely pastured by the same shepherd, and it strayed
on no common straying, but wandered away to the mountains and in
valleys, that is to say some long journey, far distant from the right path.
Did he then suffer it to stray? By no means, but brought it back neither
driving it, nor beating it, but taking it upon his shoulders. For as the best
physicians bring back those who are far gone in sickness with careful
treatment to a state of health, not only treating them according to the laws
of the medical art, but sometimes also giving them gratification: even so
God conducts to virtue those who are much depraved, not with great
severity, but gently and gradually, and supporting them on every side, so
that the separation may not become greater, nor the error more prolonged.
And the same truth is implied in the parable of the prodigal son as well as
in this. For he also was no stranger, but a son, and a brother of the child
who had been well pleasing to the father, and he plunged into no ordinary

vice, but went to the very extremity, so to say, of evil, he the rich and free
and well-bred son being reduced to a more miserable condition than that of
household slaves, strangers, and hirelings. Nevertheless he returned again
to his original condition, and had his former honor restored to him. But if
he had despaired of his life, and, dejected by what had befallen him, had
remained in the foreign land, he would not have obtained what he did
obtain, but would have been consumed with hunger, and so have
undergone the most pitiable death: but since he repented, and did not
despair, he was restored, even after such great corruption, to the same
splendor as before, and was arrayed in the most beautiful robe, and
enjoyed greater honors than his brother who had not fallen. For "these
many years," saith he "do I serve thee, neither transgressed I thy
commandment at any time, and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I
might make merry with my friends; but when this thy son is come who
hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
calf." So great is the power of repentance.

8. Having then such great examples, let us not continue in evil, nor despair
of reconciliation, but let us say also ourselves "I will go to my Father,"
and let us draw nigh to God. For He Himself never turns away from us,
but it is we who put ourselves far off: for "I am a God" we read "at hand
and not a God afar off." And again, when He was rebuking them by the
mouth of this prophet He said "Do not your sins separate between you
and me?" Inasmuch then as this is the cause which puts us far from God,
let us remove this obnoxious barrier, which prevents any near approach
being made.

But now hear how this has actually occurred in real instances. Amongst
the Corinthians some man of mark committed a sin such as was not named
even among the Gentiles. This man was a believer and belonged to the
household of Christ; and some say that he was actually a member of the
priesthood. What then? Did Paul cut him off from the communion of those
who were in the way of salvation. By no means: for he himself it is who
rebukes the Corinthians countless times, backwards and forwards, because
they did not bring the man to a state of repentance: but, desiring to prove
to us that there is no sin which cannot be healed, he said again concerning
the man who had transgressed more grievously than the Gentiles: "Deliver
such an one to Satan for destruction of the flesh that his spirit may be

saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ." Now this was prior to
repentance: but after he had repented "Sufficient," said he, "for such an
one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many "and he charged
them by a letter to console the man again, and to welcome his repentance,
so that he should not be got the better Of by Satan. Moreover when the
whole Galatian people fell after having believed, and wrought miracles, and
endured many trials for the sake of their faith in Christ he sets them up
again. For that they had done miracles he testified when he said: "He
therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among
you:" and that they endured many contests for the sake of the faith, he
also testified when he says: "Have ye suffered so many things in vain if it
be indeed in vain." Nevertheless after making so great an advance they
committed sin sufficient to estrange them from Christ concerning which he
declares saying: "Behold, I Paul tell you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
will profit you nothing:" and again "ye who would be justified by the law
are fallen away from grace:" and yet even after so great a lapse he
welcomes them saying "my little children of whom I am in travail again
until Christ be formed in you" showing that after extreme perversion it is
possible for Christ to be formed again in us: for He doth not desire the
death of a sinner, but rather that he should be convened and live.

9. Let us then turn to Him, my beloved friend, and execute the will of God.
For He created us and brought us into being, that He might make us
partakers of eternal blessings, that He might offer us the kingdom of
Heaven, not that He might cast us into Hell and deliver us to the fire; for
this was made not for us, but for the devil: but for us the kingdom has
been destined and made ready of old time. And by way of indicating both
these truths He saith to those on the right hand, "Come ye blessed of my
Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world:" but to those on the left "Depart from me, ye cursed, into fire
everlasting prepared" (he no longer says "for you" but)"for the devil and
his angels." Thus hell has not been made for us but for him and his angels:
but the kingdom has been prepared for us before the foundation of the
world. Let us not then make ourselves unworthy of entrance into the
bride-chamber: for as long as we are in this world, even if we commit
countless sins it is possible to wash them all away by manifesting
repentance for our offenses: but when once we have departed to the other

world even if we display the most earnest repentance it will be of no avail,
not even if we gnash our teeth, beat our breasts, and utter innumerable
calls for succor, no one with the tip of his finger will apply a drop to our
burning bodies, but we shall only hear those words which the rich man
heard in the parable "Between us and you a great gulf has been fixed." Let
us then, I beseech you, recover our senses here and let us recognize our
Master as He ought to be recognized. For only when we are in Hades
should we abandon the hope derived from repentance: for there only is
this remedy weak and unprofitable: but while we are here even if it is
applied in old age itself it exhibits much strength. Wherefore also the devil
sets everything in motion in order to root in us the reasoning which comes
of despair: for he knows that if we repent even a little we shall not do this
without some reward. But just as he who gives a cup of cold water has his
recompense reserved for him, so also the man who has repented of the
evils which he has done, even if he cannot exhibit the repentance which his
offenses deserve, will have a commensurate reward. For not a single item
of good, however small it may be, will be overlooked by the righteous
judge. For if He makes such an exact scrutiny of our sins, as to require
punishment for both our words and thoughts, much more will our good
deeds, whether they be great or small, be reckoned to our credit at that
day. Wherefore, even if thyself in a slight degree at least from thy present
disorder and excess, even this will not be impossible: only set thyself to
the task at once, and open the entrance into the place of contest; but as
long as thou tarriest outside this naturally seems difficult and
impracticable to thee. For before making the trial even if things are easy
and manageable they are wont to present an appearance of much difficulty
to us: but when we are actually engaged in the trial, and making the venture
the greater part of our distress is removed, and confidence taking the place
of tremor and despair lessens the fear and increases the facility of
operation, and makes our good hopes stronger. For this reason also the
wicked one dragged Judas out of this world lest he should make a fair
beginning, and so return by means of repentance to the point from which
he fell. For although it may seem a strange thing to say, I will not admit
even that sin to be too great for the succor which is brought to us from
repentance. Wherefore I pray and beseech you to banish all this Satanic
mode of thinking from your soul, and to return to this state of salvation.
For if indeed I were commanding you to ascend to your former altitude all

at once, you would naturally complain of there being much difficulty in
doing this: but if all which I now ask you to do is to get up and return
thence in and shrink, and make a retrograde movement? Have you not seen
those who have died in the midst of luxury and drunkenness, and sport
and all the other folly of this life? Were are they now who used to strut
through the market place with much pomp, and a crowd of attendants?
who were clothed in silk and redolent with perfumes, and kept a table for
their musicians, the attentions of flatterers, the loud laughter, the relaxation
of spirit, the enervation of mind, the voluptuous, abandoned, extravagant
manner of life - it has all come to an end. Where now have all these things
taken their flight? What has become of the body which enjoyed so much
attention, and cleanliness. Go thy way to the coffin, behold the dust, the
ashes, the worms, behold the loathsomeness of the place, and groan
bitterly. And would that the penalty were limited to the ashes! but now
transfer thy thought from the coffin and these worms to that undying
worm, to the fire unquenchable, to the gnashing of teeth, to the outer
darkness, to affliction and straitness, to the parable of Lazarus and the rich
man, who although the owner of so much wealth, and clothed in purple
could not become the owner of even a drop of water; and this when he was
placed in a condition of such great necessity. The things of this world are
in their nature no-wise better than dreams For just as those who work in
the mines or suffer some other kind of punishment more severe than this,
when they have fallen asleep owing to their many weary toils and the
extreme bitterness of their life, and in their dreams see themselves living in
luxury and prosperity, are in no wise grateful to their dreams after they
have awaked, even so that rich man having become rich in this present life,
as it were in a dream, after his departure hence was punished with that
bitter punishment. Consider these things, and having contrasted that fire
with the conflagration of desires which now possesses thee, release thyself
from the furnace. For he who has thoroughly quenched this furnace here,
will have no experience of that in the other world: but if a man does not get
the better of this furnace here, the other will lay hold of him more
vehemently when he has departed hence. How long a time dost thou wish
the enjoyment of the present life to be extended? For I do not suppose
indeed that more than fifty years remain to thee so as to reach extreme old
age, nor indeed is even this at all assured to us: for how should they who
cannot be confident about living even to the evening rely upon so many

years as these? And not only is this uncertain, but there is for often when
life has been extended for a long period, the conditions of luxury have not
been extended with it, but have come, and at the same time hastily
departed. However, if pared with the endless ages, and those bitter deed
both good and evil things have an end, and that very speedily: but there,
both are coextensive with immortal ages, and in their quality differ
unspeakably from the things which now are.

10. For when you hear of fire, do not suppose the fire in that world to be
like this: for fire in this world burns up and makes away with anything
which it takes hold of; but that fire is continually burning those who have
once been seized by it, and never ceases: therefore also is it called
unquenchable. For those also who have sinned must put on immortality,
not for honor, but to have a constant supply of material for that
punishment to work upon; and how terrible this is, speech could never
depict, but from the experience of little things it is possible to form some
slight notion of these great ones. For if you should ever be in a bath which
has been heated more than it ought to be, think then, I pray you, on the
fire of hell: or again if you are ever inflamed by some severe fever transfer
your thoughts to that flame, and then you will be able clearly to discern
the difference. For if a bath and a fever so afflict and distress us, what will
our condition be when we have fallen into that river of fire which winds in
front of the terrible judgment-seat. Then we shall gnash our teeth under the
suffering of our labors and intolerable pains: but there will be no one to
succor us: yea we shall groan mightily, as the flame is applied more
severely to us, but we shall see no one save those who are being punished
with us, and great desolation. And how should any one describe the terrors
arising to our souls from the darkness? for just as that fire has no
consuming power so neither has it any power of giving light: for otherwise
there would not be darkness. The dismay produced in us then by this, and
the trembling and the great astonishment can be sufficiently realized in that
day only. For in that world many and various kinds of torment and
torrents of punishment are poured in upon the soul from every side. And
if any one should ask, "and how can the soul bear up against such a
multitude of punishments and continue being chastised through
interminable ages, let him consider what happens in this world, how many
have often born up against a long and severe disease. And if they have

died, this has happened not because the soul was consumed but because
the body was exhausted, so that had the latter not broken down, the soul
would not have ceased being tormented. When then we have received an
incorruptible and inconsumable body there is nothing to prevent the
punishment being indefinitely extended. For here indeed it is impossible
that the two things should coexist. I mean severity of punishment and
permanence and cannot bear the concurrence of both: but when the
imperishable state has supervended, these terrible things will keep their
hold upon us for infinite time with much force. Let us not then so dispose
ourselves now as if the excessive power of the tortures were destructive
together with the soul, in a state of eternal punishment, and there will not
be any end to look to beyond this. How much luxury then, and how much
time will you weigh in the balance against this punishment and vengeance?
Do you propose a period of a hundred years or twice as long? and what is
this compared with the endless ages? For what the dream of a single day is
in the midst of a whole lifetime, that the enjoyment of things here is as
contrasted with the state of things to come. Is there then any one who, for
the sake of seeing a good dream, would elect to be perpetually punished?
Who is so senseless as to have recourse to this kind of retribution? For I
am not yet accusing luxury nor revealing now the bitterness which lurks in
it: for the present is not the proper time for these remarks, but when ye
have been able to escape it. For now, entangled as you are by this passion,
you will suspect me of talking nonsense, if I were to call pleasure bitter:
but when by the grace of God you have been released from the malady
then you will know its topics for another season, what I will say now is
just this: Be it so, that luxury is luxury, and pleasure, pleasure, and that
they have nothing in them painful or disgraceful, what shall we say to the
punishment which is in store for us? and what shall we do then if we have
taken our pleasure now, as it were in a shadow and a figure, but undergo
everlasting torment there in reality, when we might in a short space of time
escape these tortures already mentioned, and enjoy the good things which
are stored up for us? For this also is the work of the loving-kindness of
God, that our struggles are not protracted to a great length, but that after
struggling for a brief, and tiny twinkling of an eye (for such is present life
compared with the other) we receive crowns of victory for endless ages.
And it will be no small affliction to the souls of those who are being
punished at that time, to reflect, that when they had it in their power in

the few days of this life to make all good, they neglected their opportunity
and surrendered themselves to everlasting evil. And lest we should suffer
this let us rouse ourselves while it is the accepted time, while it is the day
of salvation, while the power of repentance is great. For not only the evils
already mentioned, but others also far worse than these await us if we are
indolent. These indeed, and some bitterer than these have their place in
hell: but the loss of the good things involves so much pain, so much
affliction and straitness, that even if not other kind of punishment were
appointed for those who sin here, it would of itself be sufficient to vex us
more bitterly than the torments in hell, and to confound our souls.

11. For consider I pray the condition of the other life, so far as it is
possible to consider it; for no words will suffice for an adequate
description: but from the things which are told us, as if by means of
certain riddles, let us try and get some indistinct vision of it. "Pain and
sorrow and sighing," we read "have fled away." What then could be more
blessed than this life? It is not possible there to fear poverty and disease:
it is not possible to see any one injuring, or being injured, provoking, or
being provoked, or angry, or envious, or burning with any outrageous lust,
or anxious concerning the supply of the necessaries of life, or bemoaning
himself over the loss of some dignity and power: for all the tempest of
passion in us is quelled and brought to nought, and all will be in a
condition of peace, and gladness and joy, all things serene and tranquil, all
will be daylight and brightness, and light, not this present light, but one
excelling this in splendor as much as this excels the brightness of a lamp.
For things are not concealed in that world by night, or by a gathering of
clouds: bodies there are not set on fire and burned: for there is neither night
nor evening there, nor cold nor heat, nor any other variation of seasons:
but the condition is of a different kind, such as they only will know who
have been deemed worthy of it; there is no old age there, nor any of the
evils of old age, but all things relating to decay are utterly removed, and
incorruptible glory reigns in every part. But greater than all these things in
the perpetual enjoyment of intercourse with Christ in the company of
angels, and archangels, and the higher powers. Behold now the sky, and
pass through it in thought to the region beyond the sky, and consider the
transfiguration to take place in the whole creation; for it will not continue
to be such as it is now, but will be far more brilliant and beautiful, and just

as gold glistens more brightly than lead, so will the future constitution of
the universe be better than the present: even as the blessed Paul saith
"Because the creation also itself shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption." For now indeed, seeing that it partakes of corruption, it is
subject to many things such as bodies of this kind naturally experience:
but then, having divested itself of all these things, we shall see it display
its beauty in an incorruptible form: for inasmuch as it is to receive
incorruptible bodies, it will in future be itself also transfigured into the
nobler condition. Nowhere in that world will there be sedition and strife:
for great is the concord of the band of saints, all being ever in harmony
with one another. It is not possible there to fear the devil, and the plots of
demons, or the threatenings of hell, or death, either that death which now
is, or the other death which is far worse than this, but every terror of this
kind will have been done away. And just as some royal child, who has
been brought up in mean guise, and subject to fear and threats, lest he
should deteriorate by indulgence and become unworthy of his paternal
inheritance, as soon as he has attained the royal dignity, immediately
exchanges all his former raiment for the purple robe, and the diadem and
the crowd of body-guards, and assumes his state with much confidence,
having cast out of his soul thoughts of humility and subjection, and having
taken others in their place; even so will it happen then to all the saints

And to prove that these words are no empty vaunt let us journey in
thought to the mountain where Christ was transfigured: let us behold him
shining as He shone there; and yet even then He did not display to us all
the splendor of the world to come. For that the vision was accommodated
to human eyes, and not an exact manifestation of the reality is plain from
the very words of the Evangelist. For what saith he? "He did shine as the
Sun." But the glory of incorruptible bodies does not emit the same kind of
light as this body which is corruptible, nor is it of a kind to be tolerable to
mortal eyes, but needs incorruptible and immortal eyes to contemplate it.
But at that time on the mountain He disclosed to them as much as it was
possible for them to see without injuring the sight of the beholders; and
even so they could not endure it but fell upon their faces. Tell me, if any
one led thee into some bright place, where all were sitting arrayed in
vestures of gold, and in the midst of the multitude pointed out one other to
thee who alone had garments wrought with precious stones, and a crown

upon his head, and then promised to place thee in the ranks of this people,
wouldst thou not do everything to obtain this promise? Open then even
now in imagination thine eyes, and look on that assembly, composed not
of men such as we are, but of those who are of more value than gold and
previous stones, and the beams of the sun, and all visible radiance, and not
consisting of men only but of beings of much more dignity than men, -
angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers. For as
concerning the king it is not even possible to say what he is like: so
completely do his beauty, his grace, his splendor, his glory, his grandeur
and magnificence elude speech and thought. Shall we then, I ask, deprive
ourselves of such great blessings, in order to avoid suffering for a brief
period? For if we had to endure countless deaths every day, or even hell
itself, for the sake of seeing Christ coming in His glory, and' being enrolled
in the company of the saints, ought we not to undergo all those things?
Hear what the blessed Peter says; "it is good for us to be here." But if he,
when he beheld some dim image of the things to come, immediately cast
away all other things out of his soul on account of the pleasure produced
in it by that vision; what would any one say when the actual reality of the
things is presented, when the palace is thrown open and it is permitted to
gaze upon the King Himself, no longer darkly, or by means of a mirror, but
face to face; no longer by means of faith, but by sight?

12. The majority it is true of those who are not very sensibly minded
propose to be content with escaping hell; but I say that a far more severe
punishment than hell is exclusion from the glory of the other world, and I
think that one who has failed to reach it ought not to sorrow so much over
the miseries of hell, as over his rejection from heaven, for this alone is
more dreadful than all other things in respect of punishment. But
frequently now when we see a king, attended by a large bodyguard, enter
the palace, we count those happy who are near him, and have a share in
his speech and mind, and partake of all the rest of his glory; and even if we
have countless blessings, we have no perception of any of them, and deem
ourselves miserable when we look at the glory of those who are round
about him, although we know that such splendor is slippery and insecure,
both on account of wars, and plots, and envy, and because apart from
these things it is not in itself worthy of any consideration. But where the
king of all is concerned, he who holds not a portion of the earth but the

whole circuit of it, or rather who comprehends it all in the hollow of his
hand, and measures the Heavens with a span, who upholdeth all things by
the word of His power, by whom all the nations are counted as nought,
and as a drop of spittle; - -in the case of such a king I say shall we no
reckon it the most extreme punishment to miss being enrolled in that
company which is round about him, but be content if we merely escape
hell? and what could be more pitiable than this condition of soul? For this
king does not come to judge the earth, drawn by a pair of white mules, nor
tiding in a golden chariot, nor arrayed in a purple robe and diadem. How
then does He come? Hear the prophets crying aloud and saying as much as
it is possible to tell to men: for one saith "God shall come openly, even
our God and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before Him, and
a mighty tempest shall be round about Him: He shall call the Heaven from
above and the earth that He may judge His people." But Esias depicts the
actual punishment impending over us speaking thus: "Behold the day of
the Lord cometh, inexorable, with wrath and anger; to lay the whole world
desolate, and to destroy sinners out of it. For the stars of Heaven, and
Orion, and the whole system of the heaven shall not give their light, and
the sun shall be darkened in its going down, and the moon shall not give
her light; and I will ordain evils against the whole world, and visit their sins
upon the ungodly, and I will destroy the insolence of the lawless, and
humble the insolence of the proud, and they who are left shall be more
precious than unsmelted gold, and a man shall be more precious than the
sapphire stone. For the heaven shall be disturbed and the earth shall be
shaken from its foundations by reason of the fury of the wrath of the Lord
of Sabbath, in the day when His wrath shall come upon us." And again
"windows" he saith "shall be opened from the Heaven, and the
foundations of the earth shall be shaken the earth shall be mightily
confounded, the earth shall be bent low, it shall be perplexed with great
perplexity, the earth shall stagger grievously like the drunkard and the
reveler; the earth shall shake as a hut, it shall fall and not be able to rise up
again: for iniquity has waxed mighty therein. And God shall set His hand
upon the host of the Heaven in the height in that day, and upon the
kingdoms of the earth, and He shall gather together the congregation
thereof into a prison, and shall shut them up in a stronghold." And
Malachi speaking concordantly with these said" Behold the Lord almighty
cometh, and who shall abide the day of His coming or who shall stand

when He appeareth? for He cometh like a refiner's fire, and like fullers
soap: and He shall sit refining and purifying as it were silver, and as it
were gold." And again, "Behold," he saith, "the day of the Lord cometh,
burning like an oven, and it shall consume them, and all the aliens, and all
who work iniquity shall be stubble, and the day which is coming shall set
fire to them saith the Lord almighty; and there shall be left neither root nor
branch." And the man greatly beloved saith "I beheld until thrones were
placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated, and his raiment was white as
snow, and the hair of his head was pure as wool: His throne was a flame of
fire, and the wheels thereof burning fire: a stream of fire wound its way in
front of Him. Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand
times ten thousand stood before Him. The judgment was set and the books
were opened." Then after a little space "I beheld," he says, "in a vision of
the night and behold" with the clouds of Heaven, one came like the Son of
Man, and reached unto the Ancient of Days, and was brought near before
Him, and to Him was given rule, and honor, and the kingdom, and all the
people, tribes and tongues serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting
dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be
destroyed. As for me Daniel, my spirit shuddered within me, and the
visions of my head troubled me." Then all the gates of the heavenly vaults
are opened, or rather the heaven itself is taken away out of the midst "for
the heaven," we read "shall be rolled up like a scroll," wrapped up in the
middle like the skin and covering of some tent so as to be transformed into
some better shape. Then all things are full of amazement and horror and
trembling: then even the angels themselves are holden by much fear, and
not angels only but also archangels and thrones, and dominions, and
principalities and authorities. "For the powers" we read "of the heavens
shall be shaken," because their fellow-servants are required to give an
account of their life in this world. For if when a single city is bring judged
before rulers in this world, all men shudder, even those who are outside the
danger, when the whole world is arraigned before such a judge as this who
needs no witnesses, or proofs, but independently of all these things brings
forward deeds and words and thoughts, and exhibits them all as in some
picture both to those who have committed the sins and to those who are
ignorant of them, how is it not natural that every power should be
confounded and shake? For if there were no river of fire winding by, nor
any terrible angels standing by the side of the throne, but men were merely

summoned some to be praised and admired, others to be dismissed with
ignominy that they might not see the glory of God, ("For let the ungodly"
we read "be taken away that he may not see the glory of the Lord")and if
this were the only punishment would not the loss of such blessings sting
the souls of those who were deprived of them more bitterly than all hell
itself? For how great an evil this is cannot possibly be represented now in
words; but then we shall know it clearly in the actual reality. But now I
pray add the punishment also to the scene, and imagine men not only
covered with shame, and veiling their heads, and bending them low, but
also being dragged along the road to the fire, and haled away to the
instruments of torture and delivered over to the cruel powers, and
suffering these things just at the time when all they who have practiced
what is good, and wrought deeds worthy of eternal life, are being crowned,
and proclaimed conquerors, and presented before the royal throne.

13. Now these are things which will happen in that day: but the things
which will follow, after these, what language can describe to us - the
pleasure, the profit, the joy of being in the company of Christ? For when
the soul has returned to the proper condition of nobility, and is able
henceforth with much boldness to behold its Master it is impossible to
say what great pleasure it derives therefrom, what great gain, rejoicing not
only in the good things actually in hand, but in the persuasion that these
things will never come to an end. All that gladness then cannot be
described in words, nor grasped by the understanding: but in a dim kind of
way, as one indicates great things by means of small ones, I will endeavor
to make it manifest. For let us scrutinize those who enjoy the good things
of the world in this present life, I mean wealth and power, and glory, how,
exulting with delight, they reckon themselves as no longer being upon the
earth, and this although the things which they are enjoying are
acknowledged not to be really good, and do not abide with them, but take
to flight more quickly than a dream: and even if they should even last for a
little time, their favor is displayed within the limits of this present life, and
cannot accompany us further. Now if these things uplift those who
possess them to such a pitch of joy, what do you suppose is the condition
of those souls which are invited to enjoy the countess blessings in Heaven
which are always securely fixed and stable? And not only this, but also in
their quantity and quality they excel present things to such an extent as

never entered even the heart of man. For at the present time like an infant
in the womb, even so do we dwell in this world confined in a narrow
space, and unable to behold the splendor and the freedom of the world to
come: but when the time of travail arrives and the present life is delivered
at the day of judgment of all men whom it has contained, those who have
been miscarried go from darkness into darkness, and from affliction into
more grievous affliction: but those which are perfectly formed and have
preserved the marks of the royal image will be presented to the king, and
will take upon themselves that service which angels and archangels
minister to the God of all. I pray thee then, O friend, do not finally efface
these marks, but speedily restore them, and stamp them more perfectly on
thy soul. For corporeal beauty indeed God has confined within the limits
of nature, but grace of soul is released from the constraint and bondage
arising from that cause inasmuch as it is far superior to any bodily
symmetry: and it depends entirely upon ourselves and the grace of God.
For our Master, being merciful has in this special way honored our race,
that He has entrusted to the necessity of nature the inferior things which
contribute nothing much to our advantage, and in their issue are matters of
indifference, but of the things which are really noble He has caused us to
be ourselves the artificers. For if He had placed corporeal beauty also
under our control we should have been subjected to excessive anxiety, and
should have wasted all our time upon things which are of no profit, and
should have grievously neglected our soul.

For if, even as it is, when we have not this power in ourselves, we make
violent efforts, and give ourselves up to shadow painting, and because we
cannot in reality produce bodily beauty, cunningly devise imitations by
means of paints, and dyes, and dressing of hair, and arrangement of
garments, and penciling of eyebrows, and many other contrivances: what
leisure should we have set apart for the soul and serious matters, if we had
it in our power to transfigure the body into a really symmetrical shape?
For probably, if this were our business, we should not have any other, but
should spend all our time upon it: decking the bondmaid with countess
decorations, but letting her who is the mistress of this bond-maid lie
perpetually in a state of deformity and neglect. For this reason God,
having delivered us from this vain occupation, implanted in us the power
of working upon the nobler element, and he who cannot turn an ugly body

into a comely on, can raise the soul, even when it has been reduced to the
extremity of ugliness, to the very acme of grace, and make it so amiable
and desirable that not only are good men brought to long after it but even
He who is the sovereign and God of all, even as the Psalmist also when
discoursing concerning this beauty, said "And the king shall have desire of
thy beauty." Seest thou not also that in the houses of prostitutes the
women who are ugly and shameless would hardly be accepted by
prize-fighters, and runaway slaves, and gladiators: but should any comely,
well-born and modest woman, owing to some mischance, have been
reduced to this necessity, no man, even amongst those who are very
illustrious and great, would be ashamed of marriage with her? Now if there
is so much pity amongst men, and so much disdain of glory as to release
from that bondage the women who have often been disgraced in the
brothel, and to place them in the position of wives, much more is this the
case with God, and those souls which, owing to the usurpation of the
devil, have then from their original noble condition into the harlotry of this
present life. And you will find the prophets filled with examples of this
kind, when they address Jerusalem; for she fell into fornication, and a
novel form of it, even as Ezekiel says: "To all harlots wages are given, but
thou hast given wages to thy lovers, and there hath been perversion in thee
beyond all other women," and again another saith "Thou didst sit waiting
for them like a deserted bird." This one then who hath committed
fornication in this fashion God calls back again. For the captivity which
took place was not so much by way of vengeance as for the purpose of
conversion and amendment since if God had wished to punish them
out-fight He would not again have brought them back to their home. He
would not have established their city and their temple in greater splendor
than before: "For the final glory of this house" He said "shall exceed the
former." Now if God did not exclude from repentance her who had many
times committed fornication, much more will He embrace My soul, which
has now fallen for the first time. For certainly there is no lover of
corporeal beauty, even if he be very frantic, who is so inflamed will the
love of his mistress as God longs after the salvation of our souls; and this
we may perceive both from the divine Scriptures. See at least, both in the
introduction of Jeremiah, and many other places of the prophets, when He
is despised and contemned, how He again hastens forward and pursues the
friendship of those who turn away from him; which also He Himself made

dear in the Gospels saying, "O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the
prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have
gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under
her wings, and ye would not?" And Paul writing to the Corinthians said
"that God was in Christ reconciling the word unto Himself, not reckoning
their trespasses unto them, and having committed unto us the word of
reconciliation. We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though
God were entreating by us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ be ye
reconciled to God." Consider that this has now been said to us. For it is
not merely want of faith, but also an unclean life which is sufficient to
work this abominate enmity. "For the carnal mind" we read "is enmity
against God." Let us then break down the barrier, and hew it in pieces, and
destroy it, that we may enjoy the blessed reconciliation, that we may
become again the fondly beloved of God.

14. I know that thou art now admiring the grace of Hermione, and thou
judgest that there is nothing in the world to be compared to her
comeliness; but if you choose, O friend, you shall yourself exceed her in
comeliness and gracefulness, as much as golden statues surpass those
which are made of clay. For if beauty, when occurs in the body, so
fascinates and excites the minds of most men, when the soul is refulgent
with it what can match beauty and grace of this kind? For the groundwork
of this corporeal beauty is nothing else but phlegm, and blood, and humor,
and bile, and the fluid of masticated food. For by these things both eyes
and cheeks, and all the other features, are supplied with moisture; and if
they do not receive that moisture, daily skin becoming unduly withered,
and the eyes sunken, the whole grace of the countenance forthwith
vanishes; so that if you consider what is stored up inside those beautiful
eyes, and that straight nose, and the mouth and the cheeks, you will affirm
the well-shaped body to be nothing else than a whited sepulcher; the parts
within are full of so much uncleanness. Morever when you see a rag with
any of these things on it, such as phlegm, or spittle you cannot bear to
touch it with even the tips of your fingers, nay you cannot even endure
looking at it; and yet are you in a flutter of excitement about the
storehouses and depositories of these things? But thy beauty was not of
this kind, but excelled it as heaven is superior to earth; or rather it was
much better and more brilliant than this For no one has anywhere seen a

soul by itself, stripped of the body; but yet even so I will endeavor to
present to you the beauty of this soul from another source. I mean from
the case of the greater powers Hear at least how the beauty of these struck
the man greatly beloved; for wishing to set forth their beauty and being
unable to find a body of the same character, he had recourse to metallic
substances, and he was not satisfied even with these, but took the
brilliancy of lightning for his illustration. Now if those powers, even when
they did not disclose their essential nature pure and bare, but only in a
very dim and shadowy way, nevertheless shone so brightly, what must
naturally be their appearance, when set free froth every veil? Now we
ought to form some such image of the beauty of the soul. "For they shall
be," we read "equal unto the angels." Now in the case of bodies the fighter
and finer kinds, and those which have retreated to the path which tend
towards the incorporeal, are very much better and more wonderful than
the others The sky at least is more beautiful than the earth, and fire than
water, and the stars than precious stones; and we admire the rainbow far
more than violets and roses, and all other flowers which are upon the
earth. And in short if it were possible with the bodily eyes to behold the
beauty of the soul you would laugh to scorn these corporeal illustrations,
so feebly have they presented to us the gracefulness of the soul. Let us not
then neglect such a possession, nor such great happiness, and especially
when the approach to that kind of beauty becomes easy to us by our
hopes of the things to come. "For our light affliction?" we read, "which is
but for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal
weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen but at the
things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but
the things which are not seen are eternal." Now if the blessed Paul called
such afflictions as thou wottest of light and easy, because he did not look
at the things which are seen, much more tolerable is it merely to cease from
wantonness. For we are not calling thee to those dangers which he
underwent, nor to those deaths which he incurred daily, the constant
beatings and scourgings, the bonds, the enmity of the whole world, the
hatred of his own people, the frequent vigils, the long journies, the
shipwrecks, the attacks of robbers, the plots of his own kinsfolk, the
distresses on account of his friends, the hunger, the cold, the nakedness,
the burning, the despondency on account both of those who belonged to
him, and those who did not belong to him. None of these things do we

now demand of thee; all that we ask for is that you would release yourself
from your accursed bondage, and return to your former freedom, having
considered both the punishment arising from your wantonness, and the
honor belonging to your former manner of life. For that unbelievers should
be but languidly affected by the thought of the resurrection and never be in
fear of this kind, is nothing wonderful; but that we who are more firmly
persuaded concerning the things of the other world than those of the
present, should spend our life in this miserable and deplorable way and be
nowise affected by the memory of those things, but sink into a state of
extreme insensibility - this is irrational in the highest degree. For when
we who believe do the deeds of unbelievers, or rather are in a more
miserable plight than they (for there are some among them who have been
eminent for the virtue of their life), what consolation, what excuse will be
left for us? And many merchants indeed who have incurred shipwreck
have not given way, but have pursued the same journey, and this when the
loss which has befallen them was not owing to their own carelessness, but
to the force of the winds; and shall we who have reason to be confident
concerning the end, and know certainly that if we do not wish it, neither
shipwreck nor accident of any kind will bring us damage, not lay hold of
the work again, and carry on our business as we did aforetime, but lie in
idleness and keep our hands to ourselves? And would that we kept them
merely to ourselves and did not use them against ourselves which is a
token of stark madness. For if any pugilist, leaving his antagonist were to
turn his hands against his own head, and deal blows to his own face,
should we not, I ask, rank him among madmen? For the devil has upset us
and cast us down; therefore we ought to get up, and not to be dragged
down again and precipitate ourselves, and add blows dealt by ourselves to
the blows dealt by him. For the blessed David also had a fall like that
which has now happened to you; and not this only but another also which
followed it. I mean that of murder. What then? did he remain prostrate?
Did he not immediately rise up again with energy and place himself in
portion to fight the enemy? In fact he wrestled with him so bravely, that
even after his death he was the protector of his offspring. For when
Solomon had perpetrated great inequity, and had deserved countless
deaths, God said that He would leave him the kingdom intact, thus
speaking "I will surely rend the kingdom out of thine hand and will give it
to thy servant. Nevertheless I will not do this in thy days." Wherefore?

"For David thy father's sake, I will take it out of the hand of thy son."
And again when Hezekiah was about to run the greatest possible risk,
although he was a righteous man, God said that He would succor him for
the sake of this saint. "For I will cast my shield" He saith, "over this city
to save it for my own sake, and for my servant: David's sake." So great is
the force of repentance. But if he had determined with himself, as you do
now, that henceforth it was impossible to propitiate God, and if he had
said within himself: "God has honored me with great honor, and has given
me a place among the prophets, and has entrusted me with the government
of my countrymen, and rescued me out of countless perils, how then,
when have offended against Him after such great benefits, and have
perpetrated the worst crimes, shall I be able to recover his favor?" If he
had thought thus, not only would he not have done the things which he
afterwards his former evils.

15. For not only the bodily wounds work death, if they are neglected, but
also those of the soul; and yet we have arrived at such a pitch of folly as
to take the greatest care of the former, and to overlook the latter; and
although in the case of the body it naturally often happens that many
wounds are incurable, yet we do not abandon hope, but even when we
hear the physicians constantly declaring, that it is not possible to get rid of
this suffering by medicines, we still persist in exhorting them to devise at
least some slight alleviation; but in the case of souls, where there is no
incurable malady; for it is not subject to the necessity of nature; here, as if
the infirmities were strange we are negligent and despairing; and where the
nature of the disorder might naturally plunge us into despair, we take as
much pains as if there were great hope of restoration to health; but where
there is no occasion to renounce hope, we desist from efforts, and become
as heedless as if matters were desperate; so much more account do we take
of the body than of the soul. And this is the reason why we are not able to
save even the body. For he who neglects the leading element, and
manifests all his zeal about inferior matters destroys and loses both;
whereas he who observes the right order, and preserves and cherishes the
more commanding element, even if he neglects the secondary element yet
preserves it by means of saving the primary one. Which also Christ
signified to us when He said, "Fear not them which kill the body, but are

not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both
soul and body in Hell."

Well, do I convince you, that one ought never to despair of the disorders
of the soul as incurable? or must I again set other arguments in motion?
For even if thou shouldst despair of thyself ten thousand times, I will
never despair of thee, and I will never myself be guilty of that for which I
reproach others; and yet it is not the same thing for a man to renounce
hope of himself, as for another to renounce hope of him. For he who has
this suspicion concerning another may readily obtain pardon; but he who
has it of himself will not. Why so pray? Because the one has no
controlling power over the zeal and repentance of the other, but over his
own zeal and repentance a man has sole authority. Nevertheless even so I
will not despair of you; though you should any number of times be heard
the prophet vehemently declaring, and plainly threatening; "yet three days
and Nineveh shall be overthrown," even then did not lose heart, but,
although they had no confidence that they should be able to move the
utterance was not accompanied by any qualification, but was a simple
declaration), even then they manifested repentance saying: "Who knoweth
whether God will repent and be entreated, and turn from the fierceness of
His wrath, and that we perish not? And God say their works that they
turned from their evil ways, and God repented of the evil which He said
He would do unto them and He did it not." Now if barbarian, and
unreasoning men could perceive so much, much more ought we to do this
who have been trained in the divine doctrines and have seen such a crowd
of ways; but far as is the Heaven from the earth, so far are my thoughts
from your mind, and my counsels from your counsels." Now if we admit
to our favor household slaves when they have often offended against us,
on their promising to become better, and place them again in their former
portion, and sometimes even grant them greater freedom of speech than
before; much more does God act thus. For if God had made us in order to
punish us, you day until the present time, what is there which can ever
cause you to doubt? Have we provoked Him severely, so as no other man
ever future. For to sin may be a merely human failing, but to continue in
the same sin ceases to be human, and becomes altogether devilish. For
observe how God by the mouth of His prophet Names this more than the
other. "For," we read, "I said unto her after she had done all these deeds of

fornication, return unto me, and yet she returned not." And again: from
another quarter, when wishing to show the great longing which He has for
our salvation, having heard how the people promised, after many
transgressions, to tread the right way He said: "Who will grant unto them
to have such an heart as to fear me, and to keep my commandments all
their days, that it may be well with them and with their children forever?"
And Moses when reasoning with them said, "And now, O Israel, what
doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and
to walk in all His ways, and to love Him?" He then who is so anxious to
be loved by us, and does everything for this end, and did not spare even
His only begotten Son on account of His love towards us, and who counts
it a desirable thing if at any time we become reconciled to Himself, how
shall He not welcome and love us when we repent? Hear at least what He
says by the mouth of the prophet: "Declare thou first thy iniquities that
thou mayest be justified." Now this He demands from us in order to
intensify our love towards Him. For when one who loves, after enduring
many insults at the hands of those who are beloved, even then does not
extinguish his fondness for them, the only reason why he takes pains to
make those insults public, is that by displaying the strength of his
affection he may induce them to feel a larger and warmer love. Now if the
confession of sins brings so much consolation, much more does the
endeavor to wash them away by means of our deeds For if this was not
the case, but those who had vehemence in evil things, will also in turn
exhibit the same in good things, being conscious and wiped them with the
hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but she since the time I came in
hath not ceased to kiss my feet. Mine head with oil thou didst not anoint;
but she hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee:
her sins which are many are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom
little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And He said unto her, thy sins are
forgiven."

16. For this reason also the devil, knowing that they who have committed
great evils, when they have begun to repent, do this with much zeal,
inasmuch as they are conscious of their offenses, fears and trembles lest
they should make a beginning of the work; for after they have made it they
are no longer capable of being checked, and, kindling like fire under the
influence of repentance, they render their souls purer than pure gold, being

impelled by their conscience, and the memory of their former sins, as by
some strong gale, towards the haven of virtue. And this is the point in
which they have an advantage over those who have never fallen, that they
exercise more vehement energy; if only, as I said, they can lay hold of the
beginning. For the task which is hard and difficult of accomplishment is to
be able to set foot on the entrance, and to reach the vestibule of
repentance, and to repulse and overthrow the enemy there when he is
fiercely raging and assaulting us. But after this, he will not display so
much fury when he has once been worsted, and has fallen where he was
strong. and we shall receive greater energy, and shall run this good race
with much ease. Let us then in future set about our return, let we have
been appointed to find our home as citizens. For to despair of ourselves
not only has this evil that it shuts the gates of that city against us, and that
it drives us into greater indolence and contempt, but also that it plunges us
into Satanic recklessness For the only cause why the devil became such as
he is was that he first of all despaired, and afterwards from despair sank
into recklessness For the soul, when once it has abandoned its own
salvation, will no longer perceive that it is plunging downwards, choosing
to do and say everything which is adverse to its own salvation. And just
as madmen, when once they have fallen out of a sound condition, are
neither afraid nor ashamed of anything, but fearlessly dare all manner of
things, even if they have to fall into fire, or deep water, or down a
precipice; so they who have been seized by the frenzy of despair are
hence forward unmanageable, rushing into vice in every direction, and if
death does not come to put a stop to this madness, and Vehemence, they
do themselves infinite mischief. Therefore I entreat you, before you are
deeply steeped in this drunkenness, recover your senses and rouse
yourself up, and shake off this Satanic fit, doing it gently and gradually if
it be not possible to effect it all at once. For to me indeed the easier course
seems to be to wrench yourself once for all out of all the cords which hold
you down, and transfer yourself to the school of repentance. But if this
seems to you a difficult thing, that you should be willing to enter on the
path which leads to better things, simply enter upon it, and lay hold on
which once was yours, let us see you once again standing on the pinnacle
of virtue, and in the same condition of perseverance as before. Spare those
who are made to stumble on thy account, those who ate falling, who are
becoming more indolent, who are despairing of the way of virtue. For

dejection now holds possession of the band of brethren, while pleasure
and cheerfulness prevail in the councils of the unbelieving, and of those
young men who are disposed to indolence. But if thou return again to thy
former strictness of life the result will be reversed, and all our shame will
be transferred to them, while we shall enjoy much confidence, seeing thee
again crowned and proclaimed victor with more splendor than before. For
such victories bring greater renown and pleasure. For you will not only
receive the reward of your own achievements, but also of the exhortation
and consolation of others, being exhibited as a striking model, if ever any
one should fall into the same condition, to encourage him to get up and
recover himself. Do not neglect such an opportunity of gain, nor drag our
souls down into Hades with sorrow, but let us breathe freely again, and
shake off the cloud of despondency which oppresses us on thy account.
For now, passing by the consideration of our own troubles, we mourn
over thy calamities, but if thou art willing to come to thy senses, and see
clearly, and to join the angelic host, you will release us from this sorrow,
and will take away the greater part of sins. For that it is possible for those
who have come back again after repentance to shine with much luster, and
oftentimes more than those who have never fallen at all, I have
demonstrated from the divine writings. Thus at least both the publicans
and the harlots inherit the kingdom of Heaven, thus many of the last are
placed before the first.

17. But I will tell thee also of events which have happened in our own
time, and of which thou mayest thyself have been witness You know
probably that young Phoenician, the son of Urbanus, who was untimely
left an orphan, but possessed of much money, and many slaves and lands.
This man, having in the first place bidden complete farewell to his studies
in the schools, and having laid aside the gay clothing which he formerly
wore, and all his worldly grandeur, suddenly arraying himself in a shabby
cloak, and retreating to the solitude of the mountains, exhibited a high
degree of Christian philosophy not merely in proportion to the sacred
mysteries, he made still greater advances in virtue. And all were rejoicing,
and a mere youth, should have suddenly trodden all the pomps of this life
under foot, and have ascended to the true height. Now which he was in
this condition, and an object of admiration, certain corrupt men, who
according to the law of kindred had the oversight of him dragged him back

again into the former sea of worldliness. And so, having flung aside all his
habits, he again descended from the mountains into the midst of the forum,
and used to go all round the city, riding on horseback, and accompanied by
a large retinue; and he was no longer willing to live even soberly; for being
inflamed by much luxury, he was constrained to fall into foolish love
intrigues, and there was no one of those conversant with him, who did not
despair of his salvation; he was encompassed by such a swarm of
flatterers, besides the snares of orphanhood, youth, and great wealth. And
persons who readily find fault with everything, accused those who
originally conducted him to this way of life, saying that he had both
missed his spiritual aims, and would no longer be of any use in the
management of his own affairs, having prematurely abandoned the labors
of study, and having been consequently unable to derive any benefit
therefrom. Now while these things were of chase, and had thoroughly
learned by experience that those who are armed with hope in God ought
not to despair at all of such characters, kept a continual watch upon him,
and if ever they saw him appear in the market place they approached and
saluted him. And at first he spoke to them from horseback, askance, as
they followed by his side; so great was the shamelessness which had at
first got possession of him. But they, being merciful and loving men, were
not ashamed at all of this treatment, but continually looked to one thing
only, how they might rescue the lamb from the wolves; which in fact they
actually accomplished by means of their perseverance. For afterwards, as
if he had been converted by some sudden stroke, and were put to shame
by their great assiduity if ever he saw them in the distance approaching, he
would instantly dismount, and bending low would listen silently in that
attitude to all which fell from their lips, and in time he displayed even
greater reverence and respect towards them. And then, by the grace of God
having gradually rescued him out of all those entanglements, they handed
him over again to his former state of seclusion and devout contemplation.
And now he became so illustrious, that his former life seemed to be
nothing in comparison with that which he lived after his fall. For being
well aware by experience of the snare, and having expended all his wealth
upon the needy, and released himself from all care of that kind, he cut off
every pretext for an attack from those who wished to make designs upon
him; and now treading the path which leads to heaven, he has already
arrived at the very goal of virtue.

This man indeed fell and rose again while he was still young; but another
man, after enduring great toils during his sojourn in the deserts, with only a
single companion, and leading an angelic life, and being now on the way to
old age, afforded I know not how a little loophole to the evil one, through
some Satanic condition of mind, and carelessness; and although he had
never seen a woman since he transferred himself to the monastic life, he
fell into a passionate desire for intercourse with women. And first of all he
besought his companion to supply him with meat and wine, and
threatened, if he did not receive it, that he would go down into the market
get some handle and pretext for returning into the city. The other being
perplexed at these things, and fearing, that if he hindered this he might
drive him into some great evil, suffered him to have his fill of this craving.
But when his companion perceived that this was a stale device, he openly
threw off shame, and unmasked his pretense, and said that he must
positively himself go down to the city, and as the other had not power to
prevent him, he desisted at last from his efforts, and following him at a
distance, watched to see what the meaning of this return could possibly
be. And having seen him enter a brothel, and knowing that he had
intercourse with a harlot there, he waited until he had satiated that foul
desire, and then, when he came out, he received him with uplifted hands,
and having embraced and fervently kissed him, without uttering any
rebuke on account of what had happened he only besought him, seeing
that he had satiated his desire, to return again to his dwelling in the
wilderness. And the other, of compunction for the deed which he had in
another hut, and, having dosed the doors of the dwelling, to supply him
with bread and when he had said this, and persuaded him, he shut himself
up, and was there continually, with fastings and prayers and tears, wiping
off from his soul the defilement of his sin. And not long after when a
drought had settled on the neighboring region, and all in that country were
lamenting over it, a certain man was commanded by a vision to depart, and
exhort this recluse to pray, and put an end to the drought. And when he
had departed, taking companions with him, they found the man, who
formerly dwelt with him, there alone; and on enquiring concerning the
other they were informed that he was dead. But they, believing that they
were deceived, betook themselves again to prayer, and again by means of
the same vision heard the same things which they had heard before. And
then, standing round the man who reply had deceived them, they besought

him to show the other to them; for they declared that he was not dead but
living. When he heard this, and perceived that their compact was exposed,
he brought them to that holy man; and they having broken through the
wall (for he had even blocked up the entrance) and having all of them
entered, prostrating themselves at his feet, and informing him of what had
happened, besought him to succor them against the famine. But he at first
resisted, saying that he was far from such confidence as that; for he ever
had his sin before his eyes, as if it had only just taken place; but when
they related all which had happened to them they then induced him to
pray; and having prayed he put an end to the drought. And what
happened to that young man who was at first a disciple of John the son of
Zebedee, but afterwards for a long time became a robber chief, and then
again having been captured by the holy hands of the blessed Apostle
returned from the robber dens and lairs to his former virtue, thou art not
ignorant, but knowest it all as accurately as I do: and I have often heard
thee admiring the great condescension of the saint, and how he first of all
kissed the blood-stained hand of the young man, embracing him, and so
brought him back to his former condition.

18. Moreover also the blessed Paul not only welcomes Onesimus the
unprofitable runaway thief, because he was converted, but also asks his
master to treat him who had repented, on equal terms of honor with his
teacher, thus saying: "I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have
begotten in my bonds, who was aforetime unprofitable to thee, but now is
profitable to thee and to me, whom I have sent back to thee; thou therefore
receive him, that is my very heart, whom I would fain have kept with me,
that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the Gospel;
but without thy mind I would do nothing that thy goodness should not be
as of necessity, but of free will. For perhaps he was therefore pared from
thee for a season that thou shouldest have him back for ever; no longer as a
servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially unto me; but
how much rather to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord? If then thou
holdest me as a partner, receive him as myself." And the same apostle, in
writing to the Corinthians, said, "Lest when I come I should mourn over
many of those who have sinned beforehand and have not repented;" and
again, "as I have said beforehand, so do I again declare beforehand, that if I
come again I will not spare." Seest thou who they are whom he mourns,

and whom he does not spare? Not those who have sinned, but those who
have not repented, and not simply those who have not repented, but those
who have been called once and again to this work, and would not be
persuaded. For the expression "I have said beforehand and do now say
beforehand, as if I were present the second time, and being absent I write,"
implies exactly that which we are afraid may take place now in our case.
For although Paul is not present who then threatened the Corinthians, yet
Christ is present, who was then speaking through his mouth; and if we
continue obdurate, He will not spare us, but will smite us with a mighty
blow, both in this world and the next. "Let us then anticipate His
countenance by our confessor" let us pour out our hearts before Him. For
"thou hast sinned," we read, "do not add thereto any more, and the first
instance." Let us not then tarry for the accuser, but let us seize his place
beforehand, and so let us make our judge more merciful by means of our
candor. Now I know indeed that you confess your sins, and call yourself
miserable above measure; but this is not the only thing I wish, but I long
For as long as you make this confession unfollow it. For no one will be
able to do anything with zeal and the proper method, unless he has first of
all persuaded himself that he does it to advantage. For even the sower, was
not to gain any good from his labor? So then he also who sows words, and
tears, and confession, unless he does this with a good hope, will not be
able to desist from sinning, being still held down by the evil of despair; but
just as that husbandman who despairs of any crop of fruit will not in
future hinder any of those things which damage the seeds, so also he who
sows his confession with tears, but does not expect any advantage for this,
will not be able to overthrow those things which spoil repentance. And
what does spoil repentance is being again entangled in the same evils. "For
there is one" we read, "who builds, and one who pulls down, what have
they gained more than toil? He who is dipped in water because of contact
with a dead body, and then touches it again, what has he gained by his
washing?" Even so if a man fasts because of his sins, and goes his way
again, and doeth the same things, who will hearken to his prayer? And
again we read "if a man goes back from righteousness to sin the Lord will
prepare him for the sword," and, "as a dog when he has returned to his
vomit, and become odious, so is a fool who by his wickedness has
returned to his sin."

19. Do not then merely set forth thy sins being thy own accuser, but as
one who ought to be justified by the method of repentance; for thus thou
wilt be able to put thy soul, which makes its confession, to shame, so that
it falls no more into the same sins. For to accuse ourselves vehemently and
call ourselves sinners is common, so to say, to unbelievers also. Many at
least of those who belong to the stage, both men and women, who
habitually practice the greatest shamelessness, call themselves miserable,
but not with the proper aim. Wherefore I would not even call this
confession; for the publication of their sins is not accompanied with
compunction of soul, nor with bitter tears, nor with conversion of life, but
in fact some of them make it in quest of a reputation for the hearers for
candor of speech. For offenses do not seem so grievous when some other
person announces them as when the perpetrator himself reports them.
And they who under the influence of strong despair have lapsed into a
state of insensibility, and treat the opinion of their fellowmen with
contempt proclaim their own evil deeds with much effrontery, as if they
were the doings of others. But I do not wish thee to be any of these, nor to
be brought out of despair to confession, but with a good expectation, after
cutting away the whole root of despair, to manifest zeal in the contrary
direction. And what is the root and mother of this despair? It is indolence;
or rather one would not call it the root only, but also the nurse and mother.
For as in the case of wool decay breeds moths, and is in turn increased by
them; so here also indolence breeds despair, and is itself nourished in turn
by despair; and thus supplying each other with this accursed exchange,
they acquire no small additional power. If any one then cuts one of these
off, and hews it in pieces, he will easily be able to get the better of the
remaining one. For on the one hand he who is not indolent will never fall
into despair, and on the other he who is supported by good hopes, and
does not despair of himself, will not be able to fall into indolence. Pray
then, wrench this pair asunder, and break the yoke in pieces, by which I
mean a variable and yet depressing habit of thought; for that which holds
these two things together is not uniform, but manifold in shame and
character. And what is this? It happens that one who has repented has
done many great and good deeds, but meanwhile he has committed some
sin equivalent to those good deeds, and this especially is sufficient to
plunge him into despair, as if the buildings which had been set up were all
pulled down, and all the labor which he had bestowed upon them had been

vain and come to naught. But this must be taken into account, and such
reasoning must be repelled, because, if we do not store up in good time a
measure of good deeds equivalent to the sins which are committed after
them, nothing can hinder us from sinking grievously and completely. But
as it is, (right action) like some stout breastplate does not suffer the sharp
and bitter dart to accomplish its work, but even if it is itself cut through, it
averts much danger from the body. For he who departs to the other world
with many deeds both good and bad, will have some alleviation in respect
of the punishment and the torment there; but if a man is destitute of these
good works, and takes only the evil with him, it is impossible to say what
great sufferings he will undergo, when he is conducted to everlasting
punishment. For a balance will be struck there between the evil deeds and
those which are not such; and should the latter weigh down the scale they
will to no small extent have saved the doer of them, and the injury arising
from the doing of evil deeds is not so strong as to drag the man down from
the foremost place; but if the evil deeds exceed, they carry him off into hell
fire, because the number of his good actions is not so great as to be able to
make a stand against this violent impulse. And these things are not merely
suggested by our own reasoning, but declared also by the divine oracles;
for He Himself saith, "He shall reward every man according to his works."
And not only in hell, but also in the kingdom one will find many
differences; for He saith "in my Fathers house are many mansions;" and,
"there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon." And what
wonder, if in dealing with such great matters he has spoken with such
precision, seeing that He declares there is a difference in that world even
between one star and another? Knowing then all these things let us never
desist from doing good deeds, nor grow weary, nor, if we should be unable
to reach the rank of the sun or of the moon, let us despise that of the stars.
For if only we display thus much virtue at least, we shall be able to have a
place in Heaven. And though we may not have become gold, or precious
stone yet if we only occupy the rank of silver we shall abide in the
foundation; only let us not fall back again into that material which the fire
readily devours, nor, when we are unable to accomplish great things, desist
also from small ones, for this is the part of extreme folly, which I trust we
may not experience. For just as material wealth increases if the lovers of it
do not despise even the smallest gains, so is it also with the spiritual. For
it is a strange thing that the judge should not overlook the reward of even a

cup of cold water, but that we, if our achievements are not altogether great,
should neglect the performance of little things. For he who does not
despise the lesser things, will exercise much zeal concerning the greatest;
but he who overlooks the former will also abstain from the latter; and to
prevent this taking place Christ has defined great rewards even for these
small things. For what is easier than to visit the sick? Yet even this He
requites with a great recompense. Lay hold then on eternal life, delight in
the Lord, and supplicate Him; take up again the wealth to slip past thee.
For if thou shouldst continue provoking God by thy deeds, thou wilt
destroy thyself; but if before much damage has been done, and all thy
husbandry has been overwhelmed with a flood, thou wilt dam up the
channels of wickedness, thou wilt be able to recover again what has been
spoiled and to add to it not a lithe further produce: Having considered all
these things, shake off the dust, get up from the ground, and thou wilt be
formidable to the adversary; for he himself indeed has overthrown thee, as
if thou wouldst never rise again; but if he sees thee again lifting up thy
hands against him, he will receive such an unexpected blow that he will be
less forward in trying to upset thee again, and thou thyself wilt be more
secure against receiving any wound of that kind in future. For if the
calamities of others are sufficient to instruct us, much more those which
we have ourselves undergone. And this is what I expect speedily to see in
the case of thy own dear self, and that by the grace of God thou art again
become more radiant than before, and displaying such great virtue, as even
to be a protector of others in the world above. Only do not despair do not
fall back; for I will not cease repeating this in every form of speech, and
wherever I see you, as well as by the lips of others; and if you listen to
this you will no longer need other remedies.

LETTER 2

1. IF it were possible to express tears and groans by means of writing I
would have filled the letter, which I now send to you, with them. Now I
weep not because you are anxious concerning your patrimony, but because
you have blotted out your name from the list of the brethren, because you
have trampled upon the covenant which you had made with Christ. This is
the reason why I shudder, this is the cause of my distress. On this account
do I fear and tremble, knowing that the rejection of this covenant will bring
great condemnation upon those who have enlisted for this noble warfare,
and owing to indolence have deserted their proper rank. And that the
punishment for such is heavier than for others is manifest for this reason.
For no one would indite a private individual for shunning military service;
but when once a man has become a soldier, if he be caught deserting the
ranks, he runs a risk of suffering the most his remaining in a fallen
condition; neither is it a grievous thing for the warrior to be wounded, but
to despair after the blow has been struck, and to neglect the wound. No
merchant, having once suffered shipwreck, and lost his freight, desists
from sailing, but again crosses the sea and the billows, and the broad ocean,
and recovers his former wealth. We see athletes also who after many falls
have gained the wreath of victory; and often, before gained the wreath of
now, a soldier who has once ran away has turned out a champion, and
prevailed over the enemy. Many also of those who have denied Christ
owing to the pressure of torture, have fought again, and departed at last
with the crown of martyrdom upon their brows. But if each of these had
despaired after the first blow, he would not have reaped the subsequent
benefits. Even so now, beloved Theodore, because the enemy has shaken
thee a little from thy position, do not thou give thyself an additional thrust
into the pit, but stand up bravely, and return speedily to the place from
which thou hast departed, and deem not this blow, lasting but for a little
while, any reproach. For if you saw a soldier returning wounded from war
you would not reproach him; for it is a reproach to cast away one's arms,
and to hold aloof from the enemy; but as long as a man stands fighting,
even if he be wounded and retreat for a short time, no one is so unfeeling
or inexperienced in matters of war, as to find any fault with him.
Exemption from wounds is the lot of non-combatants; but those who

advance with much spirit against the enemy may sometimes be wounded
and fail; which is exactly what has now occurred in your case; for
suddenly, while you attempted to destroy the serpent you were bitten.
But take courage, you need a little vigilance, and then not a trace of this
wound will be left; or rather by the grace of God thou wilt crush the head
of the Evil One himself; nor let it trouble thee that thou art soon impeded,
even at the outset. For the eye, the keen eye of the Evil One perceived the
excellence of thy soul, and guessed from many tokens that a brave
adversary would wax strong against him; for he expected that one who had
promptly attacked him with such great vehemence would easily overcome
him, if he persevered. Therefore he was diligent, and watchful, and
mightily stirred up against thee, or rather against his own head, if thou wilt
bravely stand thy ground. For who did not marvel at thy quick, sincere,
and fervent change to good? For delicacy of food was disregarded, and
costliness of raiment was despised, all manner of parade was put down,
and all the zeal for the wisdom of this world was suddenly transferred to
the divine oracles; whole days were spent in reading, and whole nights in
prayer; no mention was made of thy family dignity, nor any thought taken
of thy wealth; but to rasp the knees and hasten to the feet of the brethren
thou didst recognize as something nobler than high birth. These things
irritated the Evil One, these things stirred him up to more vehement strife;
but sleeping on the bare ground and the rest of the discipline he overthrew
you, even then there was no need to despair; nevertheless one would have
said that the damage was great if defeat had taken place after many toils,
and labor, and victories; but inasmuch as he upset you as soon as you had
stripped for the contest with him, all that he accomplished was to render
you more eager to do battle with him. For that fell pirate attacked thee just
as thou wast sailing out of the harbor, not when thou hadst returned from
thy trading voyage. bringing a full cargo. And as when one has attempted
to stay a fierce lion, and has only grazed his skin, he has done him no
injury but only stirred him up the more against himself, and rendered him
more confident and difficult to capture afterwards: even so the common
enemy of all has attempted to strike a deep blow, but has missed it, and
consequently made his antagonist more vigilant and wary for the future.

2. For human nature is a slippery thing, quick to be cheated, but quick also
to recover from deceit and as it speedily falls, so also does it readily rise.

For even that blessed man, I mean David the chosen king and prophet after
he had accomplished many good deeds, betrayed himself to be a man, for
once he fell in love with a strange woman, nor did he stop there but he
committed adultery on account of his passion, and he committed murder
on account of his adultery; but he did not try to inflict a third blow upon
himself because he had already received two such heavy ones, but
immediately hastened to the physician, and applied the remedies, fasting,
tears, lamentation, constant prayer, frequent confession of the sin; and so
by these means he propitiated God, insomuch that he was restored to his
former position, insomuch that after adultery and murder the memory of
the father was able to shield the idolatry of the son. For the son of this
David Solomon by name, was caught by the same snare as his father, and
out of complaisance to women fell away from the God of his fathers.
Thou seest how great an evil it is not to master pleasure, not to upset the
ruling principle in nature, and for a man to be the slave of women. This
same Solomon then, who was formerly righteous and wise but who ran a
risk of being deprived of all the kingdom on account of his sin, God
permitted to keep the sixth part of the government on account of the
renown of his father.

Now if thy zeal had been concerned with worldly eloquence, and then
thou hadst given it up in despair, I should have reminded thee of the law
courts and the judgment seat and the victories achieved there and the
former boldness of thy speech, and should have exhorted thee to return to
your labors in that behalf: but inasmuch as our race is for heavenly things,
and we take no account of the things which are on each, I put thee in
remembrance of another court of justice, and of that fearful and
tremendous seat of judgment; "for we must all be made manifest before the
judgment seat of Christ." "And He will then sit as judge who is now
disregarded by thee. What shall we say then, let me ask at that time? or
what defense shall we make, if we continue to disregard Him? What shall
we say then? Shall we plead the anxieties of business? Nay He has
anticipated this by saying, "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole
world and lose his own soul?" Or that we have been deceived by others?
But it did not help Adam in his defense to screen himself behind his wife,
and say "the woman whom thou gavest me, she deceived me;" even as the
serpent was no excuse for the woman. Terrible, O beloved Theodore, is

that tribunal, one which needs no accusers and waits for no witnesses; for
"all things are naked and laid open to Him" who judges us, and we must
submit to give an account not of deeds only but also of thoughts; for that
judge is quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. But perhaps
you will allege weakness of nature as the excuse, and inability to bear the
yoke. And what kind of defense is this, that you have not strength to bear
the easy yoke, that you are unable to carry the light burden? Is recovery
from fatigue a grievous and oppressive thing? For it is to this that Christ
calls us, saying," Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I
will give you rest; take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek
and lowly in heart; for my yoke is easy and my burden is light" For what
can be lighter I ask, than to be released from anxieties, and business, and
fears, and labors, and to stand outside the rough billows of life, and dwell
in a tranquil haven?

3. Which of all things in the world seems to you most desirable and
enviable? No doubt you will say government, and wealth, and public
reputation. And yet what is more wretched than these things when they
are compared with the liberty of Christians. For the ruler is subjected to
the wrath of the populace and to the irrational impulses of the multitude,
and to the fear of higher rulers, and to anxieties on behalf of those who are
ruled, and the ruler of yesterday becomes a private citizen today; for this
present life in no wise differs from a stage, but just as there, one man fills
the position of a king, a second of a general, and a third of a soldier, but
when evening has come on the king is no king, the ruler no ruler, and the
general no general, even so also in that day each man will receive his due
reward not according to the outward part which he has played but
according to his works. Well! is glory a precious thing which perishes like
the power of grass? or wealth, the possessors of which are pronounced
unhappy? "For woe" we read, "to the rich;" and again, "Woe unto them
who trust in their strength and boast themselves in the multitude of their
riches!" But the Christian never becomes a private person after being a
ruler, or a poor man after being rich, or without honor after being held in
honor; but he abides rich even when he is poor, and is exited when he
strives to humble himself; and from the rule which he exercises no human
being can depose him, but only one of those rulers who are under the
power of this world's potentate of darkness.

"Marriage is right," you say; I also assent to this. For "marriage," we read,
"is honorable and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God
will judge;" but it is no longer possible for thee to observe the right
conditions of marriage. For if he who has been attached to a heavenly
bridegroom deserts him, and joins himself to a wife the act is adultery,
even if you call it marriage ten thousand times over; or rather it is worse
than adultery in proportion as God is greater than man. Let no one deceive
thee saying: "God hath not forbidden to marry;" I know this as well as
you; He has not forbidden to marry, but He has forbidden to commit
adultery, may you be preserved from ever engaging thyself in marriage!
And why dost thou marvel if marriage is judged as if it were adultery,
when God is disregarded? Slaughter has brought about righteousness, and
mercy has been a cause of condemnation more than slaughter; because the
latter has been according to the mind of God but the former has been
forbidden. It was reckoned to Phinees for righteousness that he pierced to
death the woman who committed fornication, together with the fornicator;
but Samuel, that saint of God although he wept and mourned and entreated
for whole nights, could not rescue Saul from the condemnation which God
issued against him, because he saved, contrary to the design of God the
king of the alien tribes whom he ought to have slain. If then mercy has
been a cause of condemnation more than slaughter because God was
disobeyed, what wonder is it if marriage condemns more than adultery
when it involves the rejection of Christ? For, as I said at the beginning, if
you were a private person no one would indict you for shunning to serve
as a soldier; but now thou art no longer thy own master, being engaged in
the service of so great a king. For if the wife hath not power over her own
body, but the husband, much more they who live in Christ must be unable
to have authority over their body. He who is now despised, the same will
then be our judge; think ever on Him and the river of fire: "For a river of
fire" we read, "winds before His face;" for it is impossible for one who has
been delivered over by Him to the fire to expect any end of his
punishment. But the unseemly pleasures of this life no-wise differ from
shadows and dreams; for before the deed of sin is completed, the
conditions of pleasure are extinguished; and the punishments for these
have no limit. And the sweetness lasts for a little while but the pain is
everlasting.

Tell me, what is there stable in this world? Wealth which often does not
last even to the evening? Or glory? Hear what a certain righteous man
says: "My life is swifter than a runner." For as they dash away before
they stand still, even so does this glory take to flight before it has fairly
reached us. Nothing is more precious than the soul; and even they who
have gone to the extremity of folly have not been ignorant of this; for
"there is no equivalent of the soul" is the saying of a heathen poet. I know
that thou hast become much weaker for the struggle with the Evil One; I
know that thou art standing in the very midst of the flame of pleasures;
but if thou wilt say to the enemy "We do not serve thy pleasures, and we
do not bow down to the root of all thy evils; if thou wilt bend thine eye
upward, the Savior will even now shake out the fire, and will burn up
those who have flung thee into it, and will send to thee in the midst of the
furnace a cloud, and dew, and a rustling breeze, so that the fire may not lay
hold of thy thought or thy conscience. Only do not consume thyself with
fire. For the arms and engines of besiegers have often been unable to
destroy the fortification of cities, but the treachery of one or two of the
citizens dwelling inside has betrayed them to the enemy without any
trouble on his part. And now if none of thy thoughts within betray thee,
should the Evil One bring countless engines against thee from without he
will bring them in vain.

4. Thou hast by the grace of God many and great men who sympathize
with thy trouble, who encourage you to the fight, who tremble for thy
soul, - Valerius the holy man of God, Florentius who is in every respect
his brother, Porphyrius who is wise with the wisdom of Christ, and many
others. These are daily mourning, and praying for you without ceasing;
and they would have obtained what they asked for, long ago, if only thou
hadst been willing to withdraw thyself a little space out of the hands of
the enemy. Now then is it not strange that, whilst others do not even now
despair of thy salvation, but are continually praying that they may have
their member restored to them, thou thyself, having once fallen, art
unwilling to get up again, and remainest prostrate, all but crying aloud to
the enemy: "Slay me, smite me, spare not?" "Does he who falls not rise
up again?" speaks the divine oracle. But thou art striving against this and
contradicting it; for if one who has fallen despairs it is as much as to say
that he who falls does not rise up again I entreat thee do not so great a

wrong to thyself; do not pour upon us such a flood of sorrow. I do not
say at the present time, when thou hast not yet completed thy twentieth
year, but even if, after achieving many things, and spending thy whole life
in Christ thou hadst, in extreme old age, experienced this attack, even then
it would not have been right to despair, but to call to mind the robber who
was justified on the cross, the laborers who wrought about the eleventh
hour, and received the wages of the whole day. But as it is not well that
those who have fallen near the very extremity of life should abandon hope,
if they be sober minded, so on the other hand it is not safe to feed upon
this hope, and say, "Here for a while, I will enjoy the sweets of life, but
afterwards, when I have worked for a short time, I shall receive the wages
of the whole working time. For I recollect hearing you often say, when
many were exhorting you to frequent the schools; "But what if I bring my
life to a bad end in a short space of time, how shall I depart to Him who
has said ‘ Delay not to turn to the Lord, nor put off day after day?'"
Recover this thought, and stand in fear of the thief; for by this name Christ
calls our departure hence, because it comes upon us unawares. Consider
the anxieties of life which befall us, both those which are personal to
ourselves, and which are common to us with others, the fear (of rulers, the
envy of citizens, the danger which often hangs over us imperiling even life
itself, the labors, the distresses, the servile flatteries, such as are
unbecoming even to slaves if they be earnest minded mere the fruit of our
labors coming to an end in this world, a fact which is the most distressing
of all. It has been the lot indeed of many to miss the enjoyment of the
things for which they have labored, and after having consumed the prime
of their manhood in labors and perils, just when they hoped that they
should receive their reward they have departed taking nothing with them.
For if, after undergoing many danger, and completing many campaigns, one
will scarcely look upon an earthly king with confidence, how will any one
be able to behold the heavenly king, if he has fired and fought for another
all his time.

5. Would you have me speak of the domestic cares of wife, and children
and slaves? It is an evil thing to wed a very poor wife, or a very rich one;
for the former is injurious to the husbands means, the latter to his
authority and independence. It is a grievous thing to have children, still
more grievous not to have any; for in the latter case marriage has been to

no purpose, in the former a bitter bondage has to be undergone. If a child is
sick, it is the occasion of no small fear; if he dies an untimely death, there
is inconsolable grief; and at every stage of growth there are various
anxieties on their account, and many fears and toils. And what is one to
say to the rascalities of domestic slaves? Is this then life Theodore, when
one's soul is distracted in so many directions, when a man has to serve so
many, to live for so many, and never for himself? Now amongst us, O
friend, none of these things happen, I appeal to yourself as a witness. For
during that short time when you were willing to lift your head above the
waves of this world, you know what great cheerfulness and gladness you
enjoyed. For there is no man free, save only he who lives for Christ. He
stands superior to all troubles, and if he does not choose to injure himself
no one else will be able to do this, but he is impregnable; he is not stung by
the loss of wealth; for he has learned that we "brought nothing into this
world, neither can we carry anything out;" he is not caught by the longings
of ambition or glory; for he has learned that our citizenship is in heaven;
no one annoys him by abuse, or provokes him by blows; there is only one
calamity for a Christian which is, disobedience to God; but all the other
things, such as loss of property, exile, peril of life, he does not even reckon
to be a grievance at all. And that which all dread, departure hence to the
other world, - this is to him sweeter than life itself. For as when one has
climbed to the top of a cliff and gazes on the sea and those who are sailing
upon it, he sees some being washed by the waves, others running upon
hidden rocks, some hurrying in one direction, others being driven in
another like prisoners, by the force of the gale, many actually in the water,
some of them using their hands only in the place of a boat and a rudder,
and many drifting along upon a single plank, or some fragment of the
vessel, others floating dead, a scene of manifold and various disaster; even
so he who is engaged in the service of Christ drawing himself out of the
turmoil and stormy billows of life takes his seat upon secure and lofty
ground. For what position can be loftier or more secure than that in which
a man has only one anxiety, "How he ought to please God? " Hast thou
seen the shipwrecks, Theodore, of those who sail upon this sea?
Wherefore, I beseech thee, avoid the deep water, avoid the stormy billows,
and seize some lofty spot where it is not possible to be captured. There is
a resurrection, there is a judgment, there is a terrible tribunal which awaits
us when we have gone out of this world; "we must all stand before the

judgment-seat of Christ." It is not in vain that we are threatened with hell
fire, it is not without purpose that such great blessings have been prepared
for us. The things of this life are a shadow, and more naught even than a
shadow, being full of many fears, and many dangers, and extreme bondage.
Do not then deprive thyself both of that world, and of this, when you
may gain both, if you please. Now that they who live in Christ will gain
the things of this world Paul teaches us when he says: "But I spare you;"
and again "But this I say for your profit." Seest thou that even here he
who cares for the things of the Lord is superior to the man who has
married? It is not possible for one who has departed to the other world to
repent; no athlete, when he has quitted the lists, and the spectators have
dispersed, can contend again.

Be always thinking of these things, and break in pieces the sharp sword of
the Evil One, by means of which he destroys many. And this is despair,
which cuts off from hope those who have been overthrown. This is the
strong weapon of the enemy, and the only way in which he holds down
those who have been made captives is by binding them with this chain,
which, if we choose, we shall speedily be able to break by the grace of
God. I know that I have exceeded the due measure of a letter, but forgive
me; for I am not willingly in this condition, but have been constrained by
my love and sorrow, owing to which I forced myself to write this letter
also, although many would have prevented me. "Cease laboring in vain and
sowing upon rock" many have been saying to me. But I hearkened to none
of them. For there is hope I said to myself that, God willing, my letter will
accomplish something; but if that which we deprecate should take place,
we shall at least have the advantage of escaping self reproach for keeping
silence, and we shall not be worse than sailors on the sea, who, when they
behold men of their own craft drifting on a plank, because their ship has
been broken to pieces by the winds and waves, take down their sails, and
cast anchor, and get into a boat and try to rescue the men, although
strangers, known to them only in consequence of their calamity. But if the
others were unwilling to be rescued no one would accuse those of their
destruction who attempted to save them. This is what we offer; but we
trust that by the grace of God you also will do your part, and we shall
again see you occupying an eminent place in the flock of Christ. In answer
to the prayers of the saints may we speedily receive thee back, dear friend,

sound in the true health. If thou hast any regard for us, and hast not
utterly cast us out of thy memory please vouchsafe a reply to our letter;
for in so doing thou wilt give us much pleasure.

ST. CHRYSOSTOM:

LETTER TO A YOUNG WIDOW

TRANSLATED WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY

REV. W. R. W. STEPHENS, M. A.,

PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL, AND RECTOR
OF WOOLBEDING, SUSSEX.

INTRODUCTION TO THE LETTER
TO A YOUNG WIDOW

THE date of the following letter can be determined within very narrow
limits. It contains a reference (c.5) to the defeat and death of the Emperor
Valens in the battle with the Goths at Hadrianople, in A.D. 378, as a recent
event. The Emperor who is described as having been incessantly engaged
in war ever since his accession (c. 4) must be Theodosius, who succeeded
Valens, and as the Goths are said to be still overrunning large regions with
impunity, and insolently mocking the timidity of the imperial troops (ib.)
the letter must have been written prior to the crushing defeat which
Theodosius inflicted upon them in 382. The whole epistle is deeply tinged
with that profound sense of the unhappiness and instability of human life
with the moral corruption of society and recent calamities of the empire
impressed with peculiar force on the minds of men; producing too often
amongst Pagans either a cynical gloom or reckless indifference, but leading
Christians to cling more closely and earnestly to the hopes and
consolations of the Gospel.

LETTER TO A YOUNG WIDOW

1. THAT you have sustained a severe blow, and that the weapon directed
from above has been planted in a vital part all will readily admit, and none
even of the most rigid moralists will deny it; but since they who are
stricken with sorrow ought not to spend their whole time in mourning and
tears, but to make good provision also for the healing of their wounds, lest,
if they be neglected their tears should aggravate the wound, and the fire of
their sorrow become inflamed, it is a good thing to listen to words of
consolation, and restraining for a brief season at least the fountain of thy
tears to surrender thyself to those who endeavor to console thee. On this
account I abstained from troubling you when your sorrow was at its
height, and the thunderbolt had only just fallen upon you; but having
waited an interval and permitted you to take your fill of mourning, now
that you are able to look out a little through the mist, and to open, your
ears to those who attempt to comfort you, I also would second the words
of your handmaids by some contributions of my own. For whilst the
tempest is still severe, and a full gale of sorrow is blowing, he who exhorts
another to desist from grief would only provoke him to increased
lamentations and having incurred his hatred would add fuel to the flame by
such speeches besides being regarded himself as an unkind and foolish
person. But when the troubled water has begun to subside, and God has
allayed the fury of the waves, then we may freely spread the sails of our
discourse. For in a moderate storm skill may perhaps play its part but
when the onslaught of the wind is irresistible experience is of no avail. For
these reasons I have hitherto held my peace, and even now have only just
ventured to break silence because I have heard from thy uncle that one
may begin to take courage, as some of your more esteemed handmaids are
now venturing to discourse at length upon these matters, women also
outside your own household, who are your kinsfolk, or are otherwise
qualified for this office. Now if you allow them to talk to you I have the
greatest hope and confidence that you will not disdain my words but do
your best to give them a calm and quiet heating. Under any circumstances
indeed the female sex is the more apt to be sensitive to suffering; but when
in addition there is youth, and untimely widowhood, and inexperience in

business, and a great crowd of cares, while the whole life previously has
been nurtured in the midst of luxury, and cheerfulness and wealth, the evil
is increased many fold, and if she who is subjected to it does not obtain
help from on high even an accidental thought will be able to unhinge her.
Now I hold this to be the foremost and greatest evidence of God's care
concerning thee; for that thou hast not been overwhelmed by grief, nor
driven out of thy natural condition of mind when such great troubles
suddenly concurred to afflict thee was not due to any human assistance
but to the almighty hand the understanding of which there is no measure,
the wisdom which is past finding out, the "Father of mercies and the God
of all comfort." "For He Himself" it is said "hath smitten us, and He will
heal us; He will strike, and He will dress the wound and make us whole."

For as long as that blessed husband of thine was with thee, thou didst
enjoy honor, and care and zealous attention; in fact you enjoyed such as
you might expect to enjoy from a husband; but since God took him to
Himself He has supplied his place to thee. And this is not my saying but
that of the blessed prophet David for he says "He will take up the
fatherless and the widow," and elsewhere he calls Him "father of the
fatherless and judge of the widow;" thus in many passages thou wilt see
that He earnestly considereth the cause of this class of mankind.

2. But lest the continual repetition of this name of widow should upset
thy soul, and disconcert thy reason, having been inflicted on thee in the
very flower of thy age, I wish first of all to discourse on this point, and to
prove to you that this name of widow is not a title of calamity but of
honor, aye the greatest honor. For do not quote the erroneous opinion of
the world as a testimony, but the admonition of the blessed Paul, or rather
of Christ. For in his utterances Christ was speaking through him as he
himself said "If ye seek a proof of Christ who is speaking in me?" What
then does he say? "Let not a widow be enrolled under threescore years of
age" and again "but the younger widows refuse" intending by both these
sayings to indicate to us the importance of the matter. And when he is
making regulations about bishops he nowhere prescribes a standard of age,
but in this case he is very particular on the point, and, pray, why so? not
because widowhood is greater than priesthood, but because widows have
greater labor to undergo than priests, being encompassed on many sides by
a variety of business public and private. For as an unfortified city lies

exposed to all who wish to plunder it, so a young woman living in
widowhood has many who form designs upon her on every side not only
those who aim at getting her money but also those who are bent upon
corrupting her modesty. And besides these we shall find that she is
subjected to other conditions also likely to occasion her fall. For the
contempt of servants their negligence of business, the loss of that respect
which was formerly paid, the sight of contemporaries in prosperity, and
often the hankering after luxury, induce women to engage in a second
marriage. Some there are who do not choose to unite themselves to men by
the law of marriage, but do so secretly and clandestinely. And they act
thus in order to enjoy the praise of widowhood; thus it is a state which
seems to be not reproached, but admired and deemed worthy of honor
among men, not only amongst us who believe, but even amongst
unbelievers also. For once when I was still a young man I know that the
sophist who taught me (and he exceeded all men in his reverence for the
gods) expressed admiration for my mother before a large company. For
enquiring, as was his wont, of those who sat beside him who I was, and
some one having said that I was the son of a woman who was a widow, he
asked of me the age of my mother and the duration of her widowhood, and
when I told him that she was forty years of age of which twenty had
elapsed since she lost my father he was astonished and uttered a loud
exclamation, and turning to those present "Heavens!" cried he "what
women there are amongst the Christians." So great is the admiration and
praise enjoyed by widowhood not only amongst ourselves, but also a
amongst those who are outside the Church. And being aware of all this the
blessed Paul said "Let not a widow be enrolled under threescore years of
age." And even after this great qualification of age he does not permit her
to be ranked in this sacred society but mentions some additional requisites
"well reported of for good works, if she have brought up children if she
have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved
the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work." Heavens!
what testing and scrutiny! how much virtue does he demand from the
widow, and how precisely does he define it! which he would not have
done, had he not intended to entrust to her a position of honor and dignity.
And "the younger widows" he says "refuse; and then he adds the reason;
"for when they have waxed wanton against Christ they will marry." By
this expression he gives us to understand that they who have lost their

husbands are wedded to Christ in their stead. Observe how he asserts this
by way of indicating the mild and easy nature of this union; I refer to the
passage "when they have waxed wanton against Christ they will marry,"
as if He were some gentle husband who did not exercise authority over
them, but suffered them to live in freedom. Neither did Paul confine his
discourse on the subject to these remarks, but also in another place again
he has manifested great anxiety about it where he says "Now she who
liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth; but she who is a widow indeed
and desolate hath set her hope in God, and continueth in prayers and
supplications day and night." And writing to the Corinthians he says "But
she is more blessed if she abide thus. You see what great praise is
bestowed upon widowhood, and this in the New Testament, when the
beauty of virginity also was clearly brought to light. Nevertheless even the
luster of this state could not obscure the glories of widowhood, which
shines on brightly all the same, keeping its own value. When then we make
mention of widowhood from time to time, do not be cast down, nor
consider the matter a reproach; for if this be a matter of reproach, far more
so is virginity. But this is not the case; no! God forbid. For inasmuch as
we all admire and welcome women who live continently whilst their
husbands are yet alive must we not be delighted with those who manifest
the same good feeling concerning their husbands when they have departed
this, life, and praise them accordingly? As I was saying then, as long as
you lived with the blessed Therasius you enjoyed honor and consideration
such as is natural for a wife to receive from a husband; but now in his
place you have God who is the Lord of all, who hath of old been thy
protector and will be so now still more and with yet greater earnestness;
and as I have already said He hath displayed no slight token of his
providential care by having preserved thee whole and unharmed in the
midst of such a furnace of anxiety and sorrow, and not suffering thee to
undergo anything undesirable. Now if He has not permitted any shipwreck
to take place in the midst of so much rough water, much more will He
preserve thy soul in calm weather and lighten the burden of thy
widowhood, and the consequences of it which seem to be so terrible.

3. Now if it is not the name of widow which distresses you, but the loss
of such a husband I grant you that all the world over amongst men engaged
in secular affairs there have been few like him, so affectionate, so gentle, so

humble, so sincere, so understanding, so devout. And certainly if he had
altogether perished, and utterly ceased to be, it would be right to be
distressed, and sorrowful; but if he has only sailed into the tranquil haven,
and taken his journey to Him who is really his king, one ought not to
mourn but to rejoice on these accounts. For this death is not death, but
only a kind of emigration and translation from the worse to the better,
from earth to heaven, from men to angels, and archangels, and Him who is
the Lord of angels and archangels. For here on earth whilst he was serving
the emperor there were dangers to be expected and many plots arising
from men who bore ill-will, for in proportion as his reputation increased
did the designs also of enemies abound; but now that he has departed to
the other world none of these things can be suspected. Wherefore in
proportion as you grieve that God has taken away one who was so good
and worthy you ought to rejoice that he has departed in much safety and
honor, and being released from the trouble which besets this present
season of danger, is in great peace and tranquillity. For is it not out of
place to acknowledge that heaven is far better than earth, and yet to mourn
those who are translated from this world to the other? For if that blessed
husband of thine had been one of those who lived a shameful life contrary
to what God approved it would have been right to bewail and lament for
him not only when he had departed, but whilst he was still living; but
inasmuch as he was one of those who are the friends of God we should
take pleasure in him not only whilst living, but also when he has been laid
to rest. And that we ought to act thus thou hast surely heard the words of
the blessed Paul "to depart and to be with Christ which is far better." But
perhaps you long to hear your husband's words, and enjoy the affection
which you bestowed upon him, and you yearn for his society, and the
glory which you had on his account, and the splendor, and honor, and
security, and all these things being gone distress and darken your life.
Well! the affection which you be stowed on him you can keep now just as
you formerly did.

For such is the power of love, it embraces, and unites, and fastens together
not only those who are present, and near, and visible but also those who
are far distant; and neither length of time, nor separation in space, nor
anything else of that kind can break up and sunder in pieces the affection
of the soul. But if you wish to behold him face to face (for this I know is

what you specially long for) keep thy bed in his honor sacred from the
touch of any other man, and do thy best to manifest a life like his, and
then assuredly thou shalt depart one day to join the same company with
him, not to dwell with him for five years as thou didst here, nor for 20, or
100, nor for a thousand or twice that number but for infinite and endless
ages. For it is not any physical relation, but a correspondence in the way
of living which qualifies for the inheritance of those regions of rest. For if
it was identity of moral constitution which brought Lazarus although a
stranger to Abraham into the same heavenly bosom with him, and qualifies
many from east and west to sit down with him, the place of rest will
receive thee also with the good Therasius, if thou wilt exhibit the same
manner of life as his, and then thou shalt receive him back again no longer
in that corporeal beauty which he had when he departed, but in luster of
another kind, and splendor outshining the rays of the sun. For this body,
even if it reaches a very high standard of beauty is nevertheless perishable;
but the bodies of those who have been well pleasing to God, will be
invested with such glory as these eyes cannot even look upon. And God
has furnished us with certain tokens, and obscure indications of these
things both in the Old and in the New Dispensation. For in the former the
face of Moses shone with such glory as to be intolerable to the eyes of the
Israelites, and in the New the face of Christ shone far more brilliantly than
his. For tell me if any one had promised to make your husband king of all
the earth, and then had commanded you to withdraw for twenty years on
his account, and had promised after that to restore him to you with the
diadem and the purple, and to place you again in the same rank with him,
would you not have meekly endured the separation with due self-control?
Would you not have been well pleased with the gift, and deemed it a thing
worth praying for? Well then submit to this now, not for the sake of a
kingdom on earth, but of a kingdom in Heaven; not to receive him back
clad in a vesture of gold but robed in immortality and glory such as is
fitting for them to have who dwell in Heaven. And if you find the trial
very unbearable owing to its long duration, it may be that he will visit you
by means of visions and converse with you as he was wont to do, and
show you the face for which you yearn: let this be thy consolation taking
the place of letters, though indeed it is far more definite than letters. For in
the latter case there are but lines traced with the pen to look upon, but in
the former you see the form of his visage, and his gentle smile, his figure

and his movements, you hear his speech and recognize the voice which
you loved so well.

4. But since you mourn also over the loss of security which you formerly
enjoyed on his account, and perhaps also for the sake of those great hopes
of distinction which were dawning (for I used to hear that he would
speedily arrive at the dignity of prefect, and this, I fancy, it is which more
especially upsets and distresses thy soul) consider I pray the case of those
who have been in a higher official position than his, and yet have brought
their life to a very pitiable end. Let me. recall them to your memory: you
probably know Theodore of Sicily by reputation: for he was one of the
most distinguished men; he surpassed all in bodily stature and beauty as
well as in the confidence which he enjoyed with the Emperor, and he had
more power than any member of the royal household, but he did not bear
this prosperity meekly, and having entered into a plot against the Emperor
he was taken prisoner and miserably beheaded; and his wife who was not a
whit inferior to thy noble self in education and birth and all other respects
was suddenly stripped of all her possessions, deprived even of her
freedom also, and enrolled amongst the household slaves, and compelled to
lead a life more pitiable than any bondmaid, having this advantage only
over the rest that owing to the extreme severity of her calamity she moved
to tears all who beheld her. And it is said also that Artemisia who was the
wife of a man of high reputation, since he also aimed at usurping the
throne, was reduced to this same condition of poverty, and also to
blindness; for the depth of her despondency, and the abundance of her
tears destroyed her sight; and now she has need of persons to lead her by
the hand, and to conduct her to the doors of others that she may obtain the
necessary supply of food. And I might mention many other families
which, have been brought down in this way did I not know thee to be too
pious and prudent in disposition to wish to find consolation for thy own
calamity out of the misfortunes of others. And the only reason why I
mentioned those instances to which I referred just now was that you might
learn that human things are nothingness but that truly as the prophet says
"all the glory of man is as the flower of grass." For in proportion to men's
elevation and splendor is the ruin wrought for them, not only in the case of
those who are under rule, but also of the rulers themselves. For it would be
impossible to find any private family which has been immersed in such

great calamities as the ills in which the imperial house has been steeped.
For untimely loss of parents, and of husbands, and violent forms of death,
more outrageous and painful than those which occur in tragedies,
especially beset this kind of government.

Now passing over ancient times, of those who have reigned in our own
generation, nine in all, only two have ended their life by a natural death;
and of the others one was slain by a usurper, one in battle, one by a
conspiracy of his household guards, one by the very man who elected him,
and invested him with the purple, and of their wives some, as it is
reported, perished by poison, others died of mere sorrow; while of those
who still survive one, who has an orphan son, is trembling with alarm lest
any of those who are in power dreading what may happen in the future
should destroy him; another has reluctantly yielded to much entreaty to
return from the exile into which she had been driven by him who held the
chief power. And of the wives of the present rulers the one who has
recovered a little from her former calamities has much sorrow mingled with
her joy because the possessor of power is still young and inexperienced
and has many designing men on all sides of him; and the other is ready to
die of fear, and spends her time more miserably than criminals condemned
to death because her husband ever since he assumed the crown up to the
present day has been constantly engaged in warfare and fighting, and is
more exhausted by the shame and the reproaches which assail him on all
sides than by actual calamities. For that which has never taken place has
now come to pass, the barbarians leaving their own country have overrun
an infinite space of our territory, and that many times over, and having set
fire to the land, and captured the towns they are not minded to return
home again, but after the manner of men who are keeping holiday rather
than making war, they laugh us all to scorn; and it is said that one of their
kings declared that he was amazed at the impudence of our soldiers, who
although slaughtered more easily than sheep still expect to conquer, and
are not willing to quit their own country; for he said that he himself was
satiated with the work of cutting them to pieces. Imagine what the feelings
of the Emperor and his wife must be on hearing these words!

5. And since I have made mention of this war, a great crowd of widows
has occurred to me, who in past times derived very great luster from the
honor enjoyed by their husbands, but now are all arrayed in a dark

mourning robe and spend their whole time in lamentation. For they had
not the advantage which was enjoyed by thy dear self. For thou, my
excellent friend, didst see that goodly husband of thine lying on his bed,
and didst hear his last words, and receive his instructions as to what
should be done about the affairs of the family, and learn how by the
provisions of his will they were guarded against every kind of
encroachment on the part of rapacious and designing men. And not only
this, but also when he was yet lying dead thou didst often fling thyself
upon the body, and kiss his eyes, and embrace him, and wail over him, and
thou didst see him conducted to burial with much honor, and didst
everything necessary for his obsequies, as was fitting, and from frequent
visits to his grave thou hast no slight consolation of thy sorrow. But these
women have been deprived of all these things, having all sent out their
husbands to war in the hope of receiving them back again, instead of which
it has been their lot to receive the bitter tidings of their death. Neither has
any one come back to them with the bodies of their slain, or bringing
anything save a message describing the manner of their death. And some
there are who have not even been vouchsafed this record, or been enabled
to learn how their husbands fell, as they were buried beneath a heap of
slain in the thick of battle.

And what wonder if most of the generals perished thus, when even the
Emperor himself having been blockaded in a certain village with a few
soldiers did not dare to go out and oppose the assailants, but remained
inside and when the enemy had set fire to the building was burnt to death
together with all that were therein, not men only, but horses, beams and
walls, so that the whole was turned into a heap of ashes? And this was the
tale which they who departed to war with the Emperor brought back to
his wife in place of the Emperor himself. For the splendors of the world
differ in no-wise whatever from the things which happen on the stage, and
the beauty of spring flowers. For in the first place they flee away before
they have been manifested; and then, even if they have strength to last a
little while, they speedily become ready to decay. For what is more
worthless than the honor and glory which is paid by the multitude? what
fruit has it? what kind of profit? what serviceable end does it meet? And
would that this only was the evil! but in fact besides failing to get anything
good from the possession, he who owns this most cruel mistress is

continually forced to bear much which is painful and injurious; for
mistress she is of those who own her, and in proportion as she is flattered
by her slaves does she exalt herself against them, and ties them down by
increasingly harsh commands; but she would never be able to revenge
herself on those who despise and neglect her; so much fiercer is she than
any tyrant and wild beast. For tyrants and wild animals are often mollified
by humoring, but her fury is greatest when we are most complaisant to
her, and if she finds any one who will listen to her, and yield to her in
everything there is no kind of command from which in future she can be
induced to abstain. Moreover she has also another ally whom one would
not do wrong to call her daughter. For after she herself has grown to
maturity and fairly taken root amongst us, she then produces arrogance, a
thing which is no less able than herself to drive the soul of those who
possess it into headlong ruin.

6. Tell me then dost thou lament this that God hath reserved thee from
such a cruel bondage, and that He has barred every avenue against these
pestilential diseases? For whilst thy husband was living they ceased not
continually assaulting the thoughts of thy heart, but since his death they
have no starting point whence they can lay hold of thy understanding.
This then is a discipline which ought to be practiced in future - to abstain
from lamenting the withdrawal of these evils, and from hankering after the
bitter tyranny which they exercise. For where they blow a heavy blast
they upset all things from the foundation and shatter them to pieces; and
just as many prostitutes, although by nature ill favored and ugly, do yet
by means of enamels and pigments excite the feelings of the youthful
whilst they are still tender, and when they have got them under their
control treat them more insolently than any slave; so also do these
passions, vainglory and arrogance, defile the souls of men more than any
other kind of pollution.

On this account also wealth has seemed to the majority of men to be a
good thing; at least when it is stripped of this passion of vainglory it will
no longer seem desirable. At any rate those who have been permitted to
obtain in the midst of their poverty popular glory have no longer preferred
wealth, but rather have despised much gold when it was bestowed upon
them. And you have no need to learn from me who these men were, for
you know them better than I do, Epaminondas, Socrates, Aristeides,

Diogenes, Krates who turned his own land into a sheep walk. The others
indeed, inasmuch as it was not possible for them to get rich, saw glory
brought to them in the midst of their poverty, and straightway devoted
themselves to it, but this man threw away even what he possessed; so
infatuated were they in the pursuit of this cruel monster. Let us not then
weep because God has rescued us from this shameful thralldom which is
an object of derision and of much reproach; for there is nothing splendid in
it save the name it bears, and in reality it places those who possess it in a
position which belies its appellation, and there is no one who does not
laugh to scorn the man who does anything with a view to glory. For it is
only he who has not an eye to this who will be enabled to win respect and
glory; but he who sets a great value on popular glory, and does and
endures everything for the sake of obtaining it is the very man who will
fail to attain it, and be subjected to all the exact opposites of glory,
ridicule, and accusation, scoffing, enmity and hatred. And this is wont to
happen not only among men, but also among you women, and indeed more
especially in your case. For the woman who is unaffected in mien, and
gait, and dress, and seeks no honor from any one is admired by all women,
and they are ecstatic in their praise and call her blessed, and invoke all
manner of good things upon her; but a vain-glorious woman they behold
with aversion and detestation, and avoid her like some wild beast and load
her with infinite execrations and abuse. And not only do we escape these
evils by refusing to accept popular glory, but we shall gain the highest
advantages in addition to those which have been already mentioned, being
trained gradually to loosen our hold of earth and move in the direction of
heaven, and despise all worldly things. For he who feels no need of the
honor which comes from men, will perform with security whatever good
things he does, and neither in the troubles, nor in the prosperities of this
life will he be very seriously affected; for neither can the former depress
him, and cast him down, nor can the latter elate and puff him up, but in
precarious and troubled circumstances he himself remains exempt from
change of any kind. And this I expect will speedily be the case with your
own soul, and having once for all torn yourself away from all worldly
interests you will display amongst us a heavenly manner of life, and in a
little while will laugh to scorn the glory which you now lament, and
despise its hollow and vain mask. But if you long for the security which
you formerly enjoyed owing to your husband, and the protection of your

property, and immunity from the designs of any of those persons who
trample upon the misfortunes of others "Cast thy care upon the Lord and
He will nourish thee." "For look," it is said, "to past generations and see,
who ever placed his hope on the Lord and was put to shame, or who ever
called upon Him, and was neglected, or who ever remained constant to His
commandments and was forsaken?" For He who has alleviated this
intolerable calamity, and placed you even now in a state of tranquillity will
also avert impending evils; for that you will never receive another blow
more severe than this you would yourself admit. Having then so bravely
born present troubles, and this when you were inexperienced, you will far
more easily endure future events should any of the things contrary to our
wishes, which God forbid, occur. Therefore seek Heaven, and all things
which conduce to life in the other world, and none of the things here will
be able to harm thee, not even the world-ruler of darkness himself, if only
we do not injure ourselves. For if any one deprives us of our substance, or
hews our body in pieces, none of these things concern us, if our soul
abides in its integrity.

7. Now, once for all, if you wish your property to abide with you in
security and yet further to increase I will show thee the plan, and the place
where none of those who have designs upon it will be allowed to enter.
What then is the place? It is Heaven. Send away thy possessions to that
good husband of thine and neither thief, nor schemer, nor any other
destructive thing will be able to pounce upon them. If you deposit these
goods in the other world, you will find much profit arising from them. For
all things which we plant in Heaven yield a large and abundant crop, such
as might naturally be expected from things which have their roots in
Heaven. And if you do this, see what blessings you will enjoy, in the first
place eternal life and the things promised to those who love God, "which
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have they entered into the heart of
man," and in the second place perpetual intercourse with thy good
husband; and you will relieve yourself from the cares and fears, and
dangers, and designs, and enmity and hatred which beset you here. For as
long as you are surrounded with this property there will probably be some
to make attempts upon it; but if you transfer it to Heaven, you will lead a
life of security and safety, and much tranquillity, enjoying independence
combined with godliness. For it is very irrational, when one wishes to buy

land, and is seeking for productive ground, if, Heaven being proposed to
him instead of earth, and the possibility presented of obtaining an estate
there he abides still on earth, and puts up with the toils that are connected
with it; for it often disappoints our hopes.

But since thy soul is grievously upset and vexed on account of the
expectation often entertained that thy husband would attain the rank of
prefect, and the thought that he was untimely snatched away from that
dignity consider first of all this fact, that even if this hope was a very well
grounded one nevertheless it was only a human hope, which often falls to
the ground; and we see many things of this kind happening in life, those
which were confidently expected having remained unfulfilled, whereas
those which never even entered the mind have frequently come to pass,
and this we constantly see occurring everywhere in cases of governments
and kingdoms, and inheritances, and marriages. Wherefore even if the
opportunity were very near at hand, yet as the proverb says "between the
cup and the lip there is many a slip" and the Scripture saith "from the
morning until the evening the time is changed."

So also a king who is here today is dead tomorrow; and again this same
wise man illustrating the reversal of men's hopes says "many tyrants have
sat down upon the ground, and one that was never thought of has worn
the crown." And it was not absolutely certain that if he lived he would
arrive at this dignity; for that which belongs to the future is uncertain, and
causes us to have various suspicions. For on what grounds was it evident
that had he lived he would have attained that dignity and that things would
not have turned out the other way, and that he would have lost the office
he actually held either from falling a victim to disease, or from being
exposed to the envy and ill will of those who wished to excel him in
prosperity, or from suffering some other grievous misfortune. But let us
suppose, if you please, that it was perfectly evident that in any case had
he survived he would have obtained this high distinction; then in
proportion to the magnitude of the dignity would have been the increased
dangers, and anxieties, and intrigues which he must have encountered. Or
put these even on one side, and let us suppose him to traverse that sea of
difficulties safely, and in much tranquillity; then tell me what is the goal?
not that which he has now reached; no, not that, but something different,
probably unpleasant and undesirable. In the first place his sight of heaven,

and heavenly things would have been delayed, which is no small loss to
those who have put their trust in things to come; and in the next place,
even had he lived a very pure life yet the length of his life and the
exigencies of his high office would have prevented his departing in such a
pure condition as has now been the case. In fact it is uncertain whether he
might not have undergone many changes and given way to indolence before
he breathed his last. For now we are confident that by the grace of God he
has taken his flight to the region of rest, because he had not committed
himself to any of those deeds which exclude from the kingdom of Heaven;
but in that case after long contact with public business, he might probably
have contracted great defilement. For it is an exceedingly rare thing for one
who is moving in the midst of such great evils to hold a straight course, but
to go astray, both wittingly and against his will, is a natural thing, and one
which constantly occurs. But, as it is, we have been relieved. from this
apprehension, and we are firmly persuaded that in the great day he will
appear in much radiance, shining forth near the King, and going with the
angels in advance of Christ and clad with the robe of unutterable glory, and
standing by the side of the King as he gives judgment, and acting as one of
His chief ministers. Wherefore desisting from mourning and lamentation do
thou hold on to the same way of life as his, yea even let it be more exact,
that having speedily attained an equal standard of virtue with him, you
may inhabit the same abode and be united to him again through the
everlasting ages, not in this union of marriage but another far better. For
this is only a bodily kind of intercourse, but then there will be a union of
soul with soul more perfect, and of a far more delightful and far nobler
kind.

HOMILIES ON S. IGNATIUS AND
S. BABYLAS

INTRODUCTION TO THE HOMILIES ON S.
IGNATIUS AND S. BABYLAS.

The following homilies have been selected out of a large number delivered
by Chrysostom on the festivals of saints and martyrs, not only because
they are good samples of his discourses on such occasions, but also on
account of the celebrity of the two saints in whose honor they were
spoken. There is really very little known about Ignatius beyond the fact
that he was Bishop of Antioch, and suffered martyrdom at Rome in the
reign of Trajan about the year 110 A..D.: Being torn to death by wild beast
in the colossal amphitheatre erected for the display of such inhuman
sports by the emperors of the Flavian dynasty. The tradition that he was
a disciple of St. John does not rest on any trustworthy evidence, but on
the other hand there is nothing inherently impossible or even improbable
in the supposition.

According to a tradition which cannot be traced back earlier than the latter
part of the fourth century the reliques were translated from Rome to
Antioch and deposited in the Christian cemetery outside the gates called
the Daphnitic gate, because it led from the city to the famous suburb of
Daphne, on which we shall have more to say presently. It is clear from the
following eulogy that Chrysostom accepted this tradition, and his repeated
invitation to his hearers to "come hither" to enjoy the beneficent influence
of the saint seems to imply that his discourse was delivered in the
"martyry," that is the chapel erected to contain the martyr's remains, not
in the "Great Church" of Antioch where he commonly preached. In the
next generation the reliques of the saint were again translated by the
Emperor, the younger Theodosius, to the building which had been the
temple of the "Fortune of Antioch," and then the illustrious Christian
martyr was substituted for the mythical goddess on the tutelary genius of
the city.

The fame of S. Babylas rivalled and for a time almost threatened to
overshadow that of S. Ignatius. He had been Bishop of Antioch from
about 237 to 250. The heroic courage with which he had once repulsed the
Emperor Philip from the church until he should have submitted to penance

for some offense committed, and his martyrdom in the persecution under
Decius were his original claims to popular veneration. But some later
events shed a fresh lustre on his name. In the year 351 the Caesar Gallus,
brother of Julian, being resident in Antioch, transferred the reliques of
Babylas from their resting place within the city to the beautiful suburb the
garden or grove of Daphne. "In the history of this spot we have a singular
instance of the way in which Grecian legend was transplanted into foreign
soil. Daphne the daughter of the river-god Ladon were according to the
Syrian version of the myth, overtaken by her lover Apollo near Antioch.
Here it was, on the banks not of the Peneus but of the Oronete, that the
maiden prayed to her mother earth to open her arms and shelter her from
the pursuit of the amorous god, and that the laurel plant sprang out of the
spot where she vanished from the eyes of her disappointed love. The
house of Seleucus Nicator, founder of the Syrian monarchy was said to
have struck his hoof upon on of the arrows dropped by Apollo in the
hurry of his pursuit; in consequence of which the king dedicated the place
to the god. A temple was erected in his honor, ample in its proportions,
sumptuous in its adornments; the internal walls were resplendent with
polished marbles, the lofty ceiling was of cypress wood. The colossal
image of the god, enriched with gold and gems, nearly reached the top of
the roof. * * * With one hand to deity lightly touched the lyre which hung
from his shoulders and in the other he held a golden dish, as if about to
pour a libation on the earth "and supplicate the venerable mother to five to
his arms the cold and beauteous Daphne." The whole grove became
consecrated to pleasure under the guise of festivity in honor of the god. * *
* It contained everything which could gratify and charm the senses; the
deep impenetrable shade of cypress trees, the delicious noise and coolness
of falling waters, the fragrance of aromatic shrubs;" there were also baths,
and grottos, porticoes, and colonnades. Such materials for voluptuous
enjoyment told with fatal effect upon the morals of a people addicted at all
times to an immoderate indulgence in luxurious pleasure" Daphne became
on of those places where gross and shameless vice was practiced under the
sanction of religion. The intention of Caesar Gallus in translating the
reliques of Babylas to Daphne was as Chrysostom expresses it to "bring a
physician to the sick;" to introduce a pure and Christian association into a
spot hitherto consecrated to Pagan and licentious rites. The bones of the
saint were laid near the shrine of Apollo, and the Christian church standing

hard by the heathen temple was a visible warning to any Christian who
might visit the place to abstain from deeds abhorrent to the faith for which
the bishop had died. But the remains of the martyr were not permitted to
rest in peace. When the Emperor Julian visited Antioch 362, he consulted
the oracle of Apollo at Daphne respecting the issue of the expedition
which he was about to make into Persia. But the oracle was dumb. At
length the god yielded to the importunity of prayers and sacrifices so far
as to explain the cause of his silence. He was offended by the proximity of
dead men. "Break open the sepulchres, take up the bones, and carry them
hence." No name was mentioned, but the demand was interpreted as
referring to the remains of Babylas, and the wishes of the affronted deity
were complied with. The Christians were commanded by Julian to remove
the bones of their saint from the neighborhood of Apollo's sanctuary.
They obeyed, but what was intended to be a humiliation was converted
into a triumph. The reliques were conveyed to their resting place within
the city as in a kind of festive procession, accompanied by crows along the
whole way, four or five miles, chanting the words of the Psalm,
"Confounded be all they that worship carved images and delight in vain
gods." In vain were some of the Christians seized and tortured. The
popularity of the saint grew in proportion as Julian tried to put it down;
and the insults done to him were speedily avenged. A fire, mysterious in
its origin, broke out soon after the removal of the martyr's reliques in the
shrine of Apollo, consuming the roof of the building, and the statue of the
god. At the time when Chrysostom preached, about twenty years later,
the columns and walls were still standing, the melancholy wreck serving as
a memorial and witness of the judgment which had fallen upon the place.

The remains of Babylas were not brought back to Daphne, but removed
from the city to a magnificent church built to receive them on the other
side of the Orontes. Near the close of his discourse Chrysostom refers to
the erection of this church and to the zeal of the Bishop Meletius in
promoting it, who actually took part in the work with his own hands as
we are told that Hugh did in the building o the Minster at Lincoln. But
although the body of the martyr rested elsewhere, his spirit and influence
were supposed to inhabit in a special manner the spot where he had put
the heathen deity to silence and shame, and to confer blessings on the
pilgrims who resorted in crowds to his martyry in Daphne. The ruined and

deserted temple indeed, and the well preserved Christian church thronged
with worshippers, standing as they did side by side, formed a striking
emblem of the two religions to which they were devoted - the one
destined to crumble and vanish away, the other to endure and conquer.

HOMILIES ON
S. IGNATIUS AND S. BABYLAS

EULOGY

On the holy martyr Saint Ignatius, the God-bearer, archbishop of
Antioch the great, who was carried off to Rome, and there suffered
martyrdom, and thence was conveyed back again to Antioch.

1. Sumptuous and splendid entertainers give frequent and constant
entertainments, alike to display their own wealth, and to show goodwill to
their acquaintance. So also the grace of the Spirit, affording us a proof of
his own power, and displaying much goodwill towards the friends of God,
sets before us successively and constantly the tables of the martyrs.
Lately, for instance, a maiden quite young, and unmarried, the blessed
martyr Pelagia, entertained us, with much joy. Today again, this blessed
and noble martyr Ignatius has succeeded to her feast. The persons are
different: The table is one. The wrestlings are varied: The crown is one.
The contests are manifold: The prize is the same. For in the case of the
heathen contests, since the tasks are bodily, men alone are, with reason,
admitted. But here, since the contest is wholly concerning the soul, the
lists are open to each sex, for each kind the theater is arranged. Neither do
men alone disrobe, in order that the women may not take refuge in the
weakness of their nature, and seem to have a plausible excuse, nor have
women only quitted themselves like men, lest the race of men be put to
shame; but on this side and on that many are proclaimed conquerors, and
are crowned, in order that thou mayest learn by means of the exploits
themselves that in Christ Jesus neither male nor female, neither sex, nor
weakness of body, nor age, nor any such thing could be a hindrance to
those who run in the course of religion; if there be a noble readiness, and an
eager mind, and a fear of God, fervent and kindling, be established in our
souls. On this account both maidens and women, and men, both young and
old, and slaves, and freemen, and every rank, and every age, and each sex,
disrobe for those contests, and in no respect suffer harm, since they have

brought a noble purpose to these wrestlings. The season then already calls
us to discourse of the mighty works of this saint. But our reckoning is
disturbed and confused, not knowing what to say first, what second, what
third, so great a multitude of things calling for eulogy surrounds us, on
every side; and we experience the same thing as if any one went into a
meadow, and seeing many a rosebush and many a violet, and an abundance
of lilies, and other spring flowers manifold and varied, should be in doubt
what he should look at first, what second, since each of those he saw
invites him to bestow his glances on itself. For we too, coming to this
spiritual meadow of the mighty works of Ignatius, and beholding not the
flowers of spring, but the manifold and varied fruit of the spirit in the soul
of this man, are confused and in perplexity, not knowing to which we are
first to give our consideration, as each of the things we see draws us away
from its neighbors, and entices the eye of the soul to the sight of its own
beauty. For see, he presided over the Church among us nobly, and with
such carefulness as Christ desires. For that which Christ declared to be the
highest standard and rule of the Episcopal office, did this man display by
his deeds. For having heard Christ saying, the good shepherd layeth down
his life for the sheep, with all courage he did lay it down for the sheep.

He held true converse with the apostles and drank of spiritual fountains.
What kind of person then is it likely that he was who had been reared, and
who had everywhere held converse with them, and had shared with them
truths both lawful and unlawful to utter, and who seemed to them worthy
of so great a dignity? The time again came on, which demanded courage;
and a soul which despised all things present, glowed with Divine love, and
valued things unseen before the things which are seen; and he lay aside the
flesh with as much ease as one would put off a garment. What then shall
we speak of first? The teaching of the apostles which he gave proof of
throughout, or his indifference to this present life, or the strictness of his
virtue, with which he administered his rule over the Church; which shall
we first call to mind? The martyr or the bishop or the apostle. For the
grace of the spirit having woven a threefold crown, thus bound it on his
holy head, yea rather a manifold crown. For if any one will consider them
carefully, he will find each of the crowns, blossoming with other crowns
for us.

2. And if you will, let us come first to the praise of his episcopate. Does
this seem to be one crown alone? come, then, let us unfold it in speech,
and you will see both two, and three, and more produced from it. For I do
not wonder at the man alone that he seemed to be worthy of so great an
office, but that he obtained this office from those saints, and that the
hands of the blessed apostles touched his sacred head. For not even is this
a slight thing to be said in his praise, nor because he won greater grace from
above, nor only because they caused more abundant energy of the Spirit to
come upon him, but because they bore witness that every virtue
possessed by man was in him. Now how this is, I tell you. Paul writing to
Titus once on a time - and when I say Paul, I do not speak of him alone,
but also of Peter and James and John, and the whole band of them; for as
in one lyre, the strings are different strings, but the harmony is one, so also
in the band of the apostles the persons are different, but the teaching is
one, since the artificer is one, I mean the Holy Spirit, who moves their
souls, and Paul showing this said, "Whether therefore they, or I, so we
preach. This man, then, writing to Titus, and showing what kind of man
the bishop ought to be, says, "For the bishop must be blameless as God's
steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy
of filthy lucre; but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded,
just, holy, temperate, holding to the faithful word, which is according to
the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and
to convict the gainsayers;" and to Timothy again, when writing upon this
subject, he says somewhat like this: "If a man seeketh the office of a
bishop, he desireth a good work. The bishop, therefore, must be without
reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly,
given to hospitality, apt to teach, no brawler, no striker, but gentle, not
contentious, no lover of money. Dost thou see what strictness of virtue he
demands from the bishop? For as some most excellent painter from life,
having mixed many colors, if he be about to furnish an original likeness of
the royal form, works with all accuracy, so that all who are copying it, and
painting from it, may have a likeness accurately drawn, so accordingly the
blessed Paul, as though painting some royal likeness, and furnishing an
original sketch of it, having mixed the different colors of virtue, has painted
in the features of the office of bishop complete, in order that each of those
who mount to that dignity, looking thereupon, may administer their own
affairs with just such strictness.

Boldly, therefore, would I say that Ignatius took an accurate impression of
the whole of this, in his own soul; and was blameless and without
reproach, and neither self-willed, nor soon angry, nor given to wine, nor a
striker, but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money, just, holy,
temperate, holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching,
sober, sober-minded, orderly, and all the rest which Paul demanded. "And
what is the proof of this?" says one. They who said these things ordained
him, and they who suggest to others with so great strictness to make proof
of those who are about to mount to the throne of this office, would not
themselves have done this negligently. But had they not seen all this virtue
planted in the soul of this martyr would not have entrusted him with this
office. For they knew accurately how great danger besets those who bring
about such ordinations, carelessly and hap-hazard. And Paul again, when
showing this very thing to the same Timothy wrote and says, "Lay hands
suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins." What dost
thou say? Has another sinned, and do I share his blame and his
punishment? Yes, says he, the man who authorizes evil; and just as in the
case of any one entrusting into the hands of a raging and insane person a
sharply pointed sword, with which the madman commits murder, that
man who gave the sword incurs the blame; so any one who gives the
authority which arises from this office to a man living in evil, draws down
on his own head all the fire of that man's sins and audacity. For he who
provides the root, this man is the cause of all that springs from it on every
side. Dost thou see how in the meanwhile a double crown of the
episcopate has appeared, and how the dignity of those who ordained him
has made the office more illustrious, bearing witness to every exhibition of
virtue in him?

3. Do you wish that I should also reveal to you another crown springing
from this very matter? Let us consider the time at which he obtained this
dignity. For it is not the same thing to administer the Church now as then,
just as it is not the same thing to travel along a road well trodden, and
prepared, after many wayfarers; and along one about to be cut for the first
time, and containing ruts, and stones, and full of wild beasts, and which
has never yet, received any traveler. For now, by the grace of God, there is
no danger for bishops, but deep peace on all sides, and we all enjoy a calm,
since the Word of piety has been extended to the ends of the world, and

our rulers keep the faith with strictness. But then there was nothing of
this, but wherever any one might look, precipices and pitfalls, and wars,
and fightings, and dangers; both rulers, and kings, and people and cities and
nations, and men at home and abroad, laid snares for the faithful. And this
was not the only serious thing, but also the fact that many of the believers
themselves, inasmuch as they tasted for the first time strange doctrines,
stood in need of great indulgence, and were still in a somewhat feeble
condition and were often upset. And this was a thing which used to grieve
the teachers, no less than the fightings without, nay rather much more. For
the fightings without, and the plottings, afforded much pleasure to them
on account of the hope of the rewards awaiting them. On this account the
apostles returned from the presence of the Sanhedrin rejoicing because
they had been beaten; and Paul cries out, saying: "I rejoice in my
sufferings," and he glories in his afflictions everywhere. But the wounds of
those at home, and the fails of the brethren, do not suffer them to breathe
again, but always, like some most heavy yoke, continually oppress and
afflict the neck of their soul. Hear at least how Paul, thus rejoicing in
sufferings, is bitterly pained about these. "For who, saith he, is weak, and
I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?" and again, "I fear lest
when I come I shall find you not such as I would, and I be found of you
such as ye would not," and a little afterwards, "Lest when I come again to
you, God humble me, and I shall mourn many of those who have sinned
before, and have not repented, of their uncleanness, and wantonness, and
fornication which they have committed." And throughout thou seest that
he is in tears and lamentations on account of members of the household,
and evermore fearing and trembling for the believers. Just as then we
admire the pilot, not when he is able to bring those who are on board safe
to shore when the sea is calm, and the ship is born along by favorable
winds, but when the deep is raging and the waves contending, and the
passengers themselves within in revolt, and a great storm within and
without besets those who are on board, and he is able to steer the ship
with all security; so we ought to wonder at, and admire those who then
had the Church committed to their hands, much more than those who now
have the management of it; when there was a great war without and within,
when the plant of the faith was more tender, and needed much care, when,
as a newly-born babe, the multitude in the church required much
forethought, and the greatest wisdom in any soul destined to nurse it; and

in order that ye may more clearly learn, how great crowns they were
worthy of, who then had the Church entrusted to them, and how great
work and danger there was in undertaking the matter on the threshold and
at the beginning, and in being the first to enter upon it, I bring forward for
you the testimony of Christ, who pronounces a verdict on these things,
and confirms the opinion which has been expressed by me. For when he
saw many coming to him, and was wishing to show the apostles that the
prophets toiled more than they, he says: "Others have labored, and ye
have entered into their labor." And yet the apostles toiled much more than
the prophets. But since they first sowed the word of piety, and won over
the untaught souls of men to the truth, the greater part of the work is
credited to them. For it is by no means the same thing for one to come and
teach after many teachers, and himself to be the first to sow seeds. For
that which has been already practiced, and has become customary with
many, would be easily accepted; but that which is now for the first time
heard, agitates the mind of the hearers, and gives the teacher a great deal to
do. This at least it was which disturbed the audience at Athens, and on
this account they turned away from Paul, reproaching him with, "Thou
bringest certain strange things to our ears." For if the oversight of the
Church now furnishes much weariness and work to those who govern it,
consider how double and treble and manifold was the work then, when
there were dangers and fighting and snares, and fear continually. It is not
possible to set forth in words the difficulty which those saints then
encountered, but he alone will know it who comes to it by experience.

4. And I will speak of a fourth crown, arising for us out of this episcopate.
What then is this? The fact that he was entrusted with our own native
city. For it is a laborious thing indeed to have the oversight of a hundred
men, and of fifty alone. But to have on one's hands so great a city, and a
population extending to two hundred thousand, of how great virtue and
wisdom dost thou think there is a proof? For as in the care of armies, the
wiser of the generals have on their hands the more leading and more
numerous regiments, so, accordingly, in the care of cities. The more able of
the rulers are entrusted with the larger and more populous. And at any rate
this city was of much account to God, as indeed He manifested by the
very deeds which He did. At all events the master of the whole world,
Peter, to whose hands He committed the keys of heaven, whom He

commanded to do and to bear all, He bade tarry here for a long period.
Thus in His sight our city was equivalent to the whole world. But since I
have mentioned Peter, I have perceived a fifth crown woven from him, and
this is that this man succeeded to the office after him. For just as any one
taking a great stone from a foundation hastens by all means to introduce an
equivalent to it, lest he should shake the whole building, and make it more
unsound, so, accordingly, when Peter was about to depart from here, the
grace of the Spirit introduced another teacher equivalent to Peter, so that
the building already completed should not be made more unsound by the
insignificance of the successor. We have reckoned up then five crowns,
from the importance of the office, from the dignity of those who ordained
to it, from the difficulty of the time, from the size of the city, from the
virtue of him who transmitted the episcopate to him. Having woven all
these, it was lawful to speak of a sixth, and seventh, and more than these;
but in order that we may not, by spending the whole time on the
consideration of the episcopate, miss the details about the martyr, come
from this point, let us pass to that conflict. At one time a grievous warfare
was rekindled against the Church, and as though a most grievous tyranny
over-spread the earth, all were carried off from the midst of the
market-place. Not indeed charged with anything monstrous, but because
being freed from error, they hastened to piety; because they abstained
from the service of demons, because they recognized the true God, and
worshipped his only begotten Son, and for things for which they ought to
have been crowned, and admired and honored, for these they were
punished and encountered countless tortures, all who embraced the faith,
and much more they who had the oversight of the churches. For the devil,
being crafty, and apt to contrive plots of this kind, expected that if he took
away the shepherds, he would easily be able to scatter the flocks. But He
who takes the wise in their craftiness, wishing to show him that men do
not govern His church, but that it is He himself who everywhere tends
those who believe on Him, agreed that this should be, that he might see,
when they were taken away, that the cause of piety was not defeated, nor
the word of preaching quenched, but rather increased; that by these very
works he might learn both himself, and all those who minister to him, that
our affairs are not of men, but that the subject of our teaching has its root
on high, from the heavens; and that it is God who everywhere leads the
Church, and that it is not possible for him who fights against God, ever to

win the day. But the Devil did not only work this evil, but another also
not less than this. For not only in the cities over which they presided, did
he suffer the Bishops to be slaughtered; but he took them into foreign
territory and slew them; and he did this, in anxiety at once to take them
when destitute of friends, and hoping to render them weaker with the toil
of their journey, which accordingly he did with this saint. For he called
him away from our city to Rome, making the course twice as long,
expecting to depress his mind both by the length of the way and the
number of the days, and not knowing that having Jesus with him, as a
fellow traveler, and fellow exile on so long a journey, he rather became the
stronger, and afforded more proof of the power that was with him, and to
a greater degree knit the Churches together. For the cities which were on
the road running together from all sides, encouraged the athlete, and sped
him on his way with many supplies, sharing in his conflict by their
prayers, and intercessions. And they derived no little comfort when they
saw the martyr hastening to death with so much readiness, as is consistent
in one called to the realms which are in the heaven, and by means of the
works themselves, by the readiness and by the joyousness of that noble
man, that it was not death to which he was hastening, but a kind of long
journey and migration from this world, and ascension to heaven; and he
departed teaching these things in every city, both by his words, and by his
deeds, and as happened in the case of the Jews, when they bound Paul,
and sent him to Rome, and thought that they were sending him to death,
they were sending a teacher to the Jews who dwelt there. This indeed
accordingly happened in the case of Ignatius in larger measure. For not to
those alone who dwell in Rome, but to all the cities lying in the intervening
space, he went forth as a wonderful teacher, persuading them to despise
the present life, and to think naught of the things which are seen, and to
love those which are to come, to look towards heaven, and to pay no
regard to any of the terrors of this present life. For on this and on more
than this, by means of his works, he went on his way instructing them, as
a sun rising from the east, and hastening to the west. But rather more
brilliant than this, for this is wont to run on high, bringing material light,
but Ignatius shone below, imparting to men's souls the intellectual light of
doctrine. And that light on departing into the regions of the west, is hidden
and straightway causes the night to come on. But this on departing to the
regions of the west, shone there more brilliantly, conferring the greatest

benefits to all along the road. And when he arrived at the city, even that he
instructed in Christian wisdom. For on this account God permitted him
there to end his life, so that this man's death might be instructive to all
who dwell in Rome. For we by the grace of God need henceforward no
evidence, being rooted in the faith. But they who dwelt in Rome, inasmuch
as these was great impiety there, required more help. On this account both
Peter and Paul, and this man after them, were all slain there, partly, indeed,
in order that they might purify with their own blood, the city which had
been defiled with blood of idols, and partly in order that they might by
their works afford a proof of the resurrection of the crucified Christ,
persuading those who dwell in Rome, that they would not with so much
pleasure disdain this present life, did they not firmly persuade themselves
that they were about to ascend to the crucified Jesus, and to see him in the
heavens. For in reality it is the greatest proof of the resurrection that the
slain Christ should show forth so great power after death, as to persuade
living men to despise both country and home and friends, and acquaintance
and life itself, for the sake of confessing him, and to choose in place of
present pleasures, both stripes and dangers and death. For these are not
the achievements of any dead man, nor of one remaining in the tomb but of
one risen and living, Since how couldest thou account, when he was alive,
for all the Apostles who companied with him becoming weaker through
fear to betray their teachers and to flee and depart; but when he died, for
not only Peter and Paul, but even Ignatius, who had not even seen him, nor
enjoyed his companionship, showing such earnestness as to lay down life
itself for his sake?

5. In order then that all who dwell in Rome might learn that these things
are a reality, God allowed that there the saint should be perfected, and that
this was the reason I will guarantee from the very manner of his death. For
not outside the walls, in a dungeon, nor even in a court of justice, nor in
some corner, did he receive the sentence which condemned him, but in the
midst of the theater, while the whole city was seated above him, he
underwent this form of martyrdom, wild beasts being let loose upon him,
in order that he might plant his trophy against the Devil, beneath the eyes
of all, and make all spectators emulous of his own conflicts. Not dying
thus nobly only, but dying even with pleasure. For not as though about to
be severed from life, but as called to a better and more spiritual life, so he

beheld the wild beasts gladly. Whence is this manifest? From the words
which he uttered when about to die, for when he heard that this manner of
punishment awaited him, "may I have joy," said he, "of these wild
beasts." For such are the loving. For they receive with pleasure whatever
they may suffer for the sake of those who are beloved, and they seem to
have their desire satisfied when what happens to them is more than
usually grievous. Which happened, therefore, in this man's case. For not
by his death alone, but also by his readiness he studied to emulate the
apostles, and hearing that they, after they had been scourged retired with
joy, himself too wished to imitate his teachers, not only by his death, but
by his joy. On this account he said, "may I have joy of thy wild beasts,"
and much milder than the tongue of the tyrant did he consider the mouths
of these; and very reasonably. For while that invited him to Gehenna, their
mouths escorted him to a kingdom. When, therefore, he made an end of life
there, yea rather, when he ascended to heaven, he departed henceforward
crowned. For this also happened through the dispensation of God, that he
restored him again to us, and distributed the martyr to the cities. For that
city received his blood as it dropped, but ye were honored with his
remains, ye enjoyed his episcopate, they enjoyed his martyrdom. They
saw him in conflict, and victorious, and crowned, but ye have him
continually. For a little time God removed him from you, and with greater
glory granted him again to you. And as those who borrow money, return
with interest what they receive, so also God, using this valued treasure of
yours, for a little while, and having shown it to that city, with greater
brilliancy gave it back to you. Ye sent forth a Bishop, and received a
martyr; ye sent him forth with prayers, and ye received him with crowns;
and not only ye, but all the cities which intervene. For how do ye think
that they behaved when they saw his remains being brought back? What
pleasure was produced! how they rejoiced! with what applause on all
sides they beset the crowned one! For as with a noble athlete, who has
wrestled down all his antagonists, and who comes forth with radiant glory
from the arena, the spectators receive him, and do not suffer him to tread
the earth, bringing him home on their shoulders, and besetting him with
countless praises: so also the cities in order receiving this saint then from
Rome, and bearing him upon their shoulders as far as this city, escorted
the crowned one with praises, celebrating the champion, in song; laughing
the Devil to scorn, because his artifice was turned against him, and what he

thought to do against the martyr, this turned out for his behoof. Then,
indeed, he profited, and encouraged all the cities; and from that time to this
day he enriches this city, and as some perpetual treasure, drawn upon
every day, yet not failing, makes all who partake of it more prosperous, so
also this blessed Ignatius filleth those who come to him with blessings,
with boldness, nobleness of spirit, and much courage, and so sendeth them
home.

Not only today, therefore, but every day let us go forth to him, plucking
spiritual fruits from him. For it is, it is possible for him who comes hither
with faith to gather the fruit of many good things. For not the bodies only,
but the very sepulchers of the saints have been filled with spiritual grace.
For if in the case of Elisha this happened, and a corpse when it touched
the sepulcher, burst the bands of death and returned to life again, much
rather now, when grace is more abundant, when the energy of the spirit is
greater, is it possible that one touching a sepulcher, with faith, should win
great power; thence on this account God allowed us the remains of the
saints, wishing to lead by them us to the same emulation, and to afford us
a kind of haven, and a secure consolation for the evils which are ever
overtaking us. Wherefore I beseech you all, if any is in despondency, if in
disease, if under insult, if in any other circumstance of this life, if in the
depth of sins, let him come hither with faith, and he will lay aside all those
things, and will return with much joy, having procured a lighter conscience
from the sight alone. But more, it is not only necessary that those who are
in affliction should come hither, but if any one be in cheerfulness, in glory,
in power, in much assurance towards God, let not this man despise the
benefit. For coming hither and beholding this saint, he will keep these
noble possessions unmoved, persuading his own soul to be moderate by
the recollection of this man's mighty deeds, and not suffering his
conscience by the mighty deeds to be lifted up to any self conceit. And it
is no slight thing for those in prosperity not to be puffed up at their good
fortune, but to know how to bear their prosperity with moderation, so
that the treasure is serviceable to all, the resting place is suitable, for the
fallen, in order that they may escape from their temptations, for the
fortunate, that their success may remain secure, for those in weakness
indeed, that they may return to health, and for the healthy, that they may
not fall into weakness. Considering all which things, let us prefer this way

of spending our time, to all delight, all pleasure, in order that rejoicing at
once, and profiling, we may be able to become partakers with these saints,
both of their dwelling and of their home, through the prayers of the saints
themselves, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with whom be glory to the Father with the Holy Spirit, now and always
forever and ever amen.

ON THE HOLY MARTYR, S. BABYLAS

1. I WAS anxious today to pay the debt which I promised you when I was
lately here. But what am I to do? In the meanwhile, the blessed Babylas
has appeared, and has called me to himself, uttering no voice, but attracting
our attention by the brightness of his countenance. Be ye not, therefore,
displeased at the delay in my payment; at all events, the longer the time is,
the more the interest will increase. For we will deposit this money with
interest. Since thus did the master command who entrusted it to us. Being
confident, therefore, about what is lent, that both the principal and the
profit await you, let us not pass by the gain which falls in our way today,
but revel in the noble actions of the blessed Babylas.

How, indeed, he presided over the Church which is among us, and saved
that sacred ship, in storm, and in wave, and billow; and what a bold front
he showed to the emperor, and how he lay down his life for the sheep and
underwent that blessed slaughter; these things and such as these, we will
leave to the elder among our teachers, and to our common father, to speak
of. For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many
things as happened lately, and within our lifetime, these, I a young man
will relate to you, I mean those after death, those after the burial of the
martyr, those which happened while he remained in the suburbs of the
city. And I know indeed that the Greeks will laugh at my promise, if I
promise to speak of the noble deeds after death and burial of one who was
buried, and had crumbled to dust. We shall not assuredly on this account
keep silence, but on this very account shall especially speak, in order that
by showing this marvel truly, we may turn their laughter upon their own
head. For of an ordinary man there would be no noble deeds after death.
But of a martyr, many and great deeds, not in order that he might become
more illustrious (for he has no need of glory from the multitude), but that
thou, the unbeliever mayest learn that the death of the martyrs is not
death, but the beginning of a better life, and the prelude of a more spiritual
conversation, and a change from the worse to the better. Do not then look
at the fact, that the mere body of the martyr lies destitute of energy of
soul; but observe this, that a greater power takes its place by the side of it,
different from the soul itself - I mean the grace of the Holy Spirit, which

pleads to all on behalf of the resurrection, by means of the wonders which
it works. For if God has granted greater power to bodies dead and
crumbled to dust, than to all living, much more will he grant to them a
better life than the former, and a longer, at the time of the bestowal of his
crowns; what then are this saint's noble deeds? But be not disturbed, if we
take our discourse a little further back. For they who wish to display their
portraits to advantage, do not uncover them until they have placed the
spectators a little way off from the picture, making the view clearer by the
distance. Do you then also have patience with me while I direct my
discourse into the past.

For when Julian who surpassed all in impiety, ascended the imperial
throne, and grasped the despotic scepter, straightway he lifted up his
hands against the God who created him, and ignored his benefactor, and
looking from the earth beneath to the heavens, howled after the manner of
mad dogs, who alike bay at those who do not feed them and those who do
feed them. But he rather was mad with a more savage madness than theirs.
For they indeed turn from, and hate their friends and strangers alike. But
this man used to fawn upon demons, strangers to his salvation, and used
to worship them with every mode of worship. But his benefactor, and
Savior, and him who spared not the only Begotten, for his sake, he turned
from and used to hate, and made havoc of the cross, the very thing which
uplifted the whole world when it was lying prostrate, and drove away the
darkness on all sides, and brought in light more brilliant than the sunbeams;
nor yet even then did he desist from his frenzy, but promised that he
would tear the nation of the Galilaeans, out of the midst of the world; for
thus he was wont to call us; and yet if he thought the names of the
Christians an abomination, and Christianity itself to be full of much
shame, for what reason did he not desire to put us to shame by that
means, but with a strange name? Yea because he knew clearly, that to be
called by what belongs to Christ, is a great ornament not only to men, but
to angels, and to the powers above. On this account he set everything in
motion, so as to strip us of this ornament, and put a stop to the preaching
of it. But this was impossible, O wretched and miserable man! as it was
impossible to destroy the heaven and to quench the sun, and to shake and
cast down the foundations of the earth, and those things Christ foretold,

thus saying: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not
pass away."

Well, thou dost not submit to Christ's words; accept therefore the
utterance which thus his deeds give. For I indeed having been privileged to
know what the declaration of God is, how strong, how invincible a thing,
have believed that is more trustworthy than the order of nature, and than
experience in all matters. But do thou still creeping on the ground, and
agitated with the investigations of human reasoning, receive the witness of
the deeds. I gainsay nothing. I strive not.

2. What then do the deeds say? Christ said that it was easier for heaven
and earth to be destroyed, than for any of his words to fail. The emperor
contradicted these words, and threatened to destroy his decrees. Where
then is the emperor who threatened these things? He is perished and is
corrupted, and is now in Hades, awaiting the inevitable punishment. But
where is Christ who uttered these decrees? In Heaven, on the right hand of
the Father, occupying the highest throne of glory; where are the
blasphemous words of the Emperor, and his unchastened tongue? They
are become ashes, and dust and the food of worms. Where is the sentence
of Christ? It shines forth by the very truth of the deed, receiving its luster
from the issue of the events, as from a golden column. And yet the
emperor left nothing undone, when about to raise war against us, but used
to call prophets together, and summon sorcerers, and everything was full
of demons and evil spirits.

What then was the return for this worship? The overturning of cities, the
bitterest famine of all famines. For ye know doubtless, and remember, how
empty indeed the market place was of wares, and the workshops full of
confusion, when everyone strove to snatch up what came first and to
depart. And why do I speak of famine, when the very fountains of waters
were failing, fountains which by the abundance of their stream, used to
eclipse the rivers. But since I have mentioned the fountains, come,
forthwith, let us go up to Daphne, and conduct our discourse to the noble
deeds of the martyr. Although you desire me still to parade the indecencies
of the Greeks, although I too desire this, let us abstain; for wherever the
commemoration of a martyr is, there certainly also is the shame of the
Greeks. This emperor then, going up to Daphne used to weary Apollo,

praying, supplicating, entreating, so that the events of the future might be
foretold to him. What then did the prophet, the great God of the Greeks?
"The dead prevent me from uttering," saith he, "but break open the graves,
dig up the bones, move the dead." What could be more impious than these
commands? The Demon of grave-robbing, introduces strange laws and
devises new methods of expelling strangers. Who ever heard of the dead
being driven forth? who ever saw lifeless bodies ordered to be moved as he
commanded, overturning from their foundations the common laws of
nature. For the laws of nature are common to all men, that he who departs
this life should be hidden in the earth, and delivered over for burial, and be
covered up in the bosom of the earth the mother of all; and these laws,
neither Greek, barbarian, Scythian, nor if there be any more savage than
they, ever changed, but all reverence them, and keep them, and thus they
are sacred and venerated by all. But the Demon raises his mask, and with
bare head, resists the common laws of nature. For the dead, he says, are a
pollution. The dead are not a pollution, a most wicked demon, but a
wicked intention is an abomination. But if one must say something
startling, the bodies of the living full of evil, are more polluting than those
of the dead. For the one minister to the behests of the mind, but the other
lie unmoved. Now that which is unmoved, and destitute of all perception
would be free from all accusation. Not that I even would say that the
bodies of the living are by nature polluting; but that everywhere a wicked
and perverted intention is open to accusations from all.

The dead body then is not a pollution O Apollo, but to persecute a maiden
who wishes to be modest, and to outrage the dignity of a virgin, and to
lament at the failure of the shameless deed, this is worthy of accusation,
and punishment. There were at all events, many wonderful and great
prophets among ourselves, who spake also many things concerning the
future, and they in no case used to bid those who asked them to dig up the
bones of the departed. Yea Ezekiel standing near the bones themselves was
not only not hindered by them, but added flesh, and nerves and skin to
them, and brought them back to life again. But the great Moses did not
stand near the bones of the dead, but bearing off the whole dead body of
Joseph, thus foretold things to come. And very reasonably, for their
words were the grace of the Holy Spirit. But the words of these, a deceit,
and a lie which is no wise able to be concealed. For that these things were

an excuse, and pretense and that he feared the blessed Babylas, is manifest
from what the emperor did. For leaving all the other dead, he only moved
that martyr. And yet if he did these things, in disgust at him, and not in
fear, it were necessary that he should order the coffin to be broken, thrown
into the sea, carried to the desert, be made to disappear by some other
method of destruction; for this is the part of one who is disgusted. Thus
God did when he spake to the Hebrews about the abominations of the
Gentiles. He bade their statues to be broken, not to bring their
abominations from the suburbs to the city.

3. The martyr then was moved, but the demon not even then enjoyed
freedom from fear, but straightway learned that it is possible to move the
bones of a martyr, but not to escape his hands. For as soon as the coffin
was drawn into the city, a thunderbolt came from above upon the head of
his image, and burnt it all up. And yet, if not before, then at least there
was likelihood that the impious emperor would be angry, and that he
would send forth his anger against the testimony of the martyr. But not
even then did he dare, so great fear possessed him. But although he saw
that the burning was intolerable, and knew the cause accurately; he kept
quiet. And this is not only wonderful that he did not destroy the
testimony, but that he not even dared to put the roof on to the temple
again. For he knew, he knew, that the stroke was divinely sent, and he
feared lest by forming any further plan, he should call down that fire upon
his own head. On this account he endured to see the shrine of Apollo
brought to so great desolation; For there was no other cause, on account of
which he did not rectify that which had happened, but fear alone. For
which reason he unwillingly kept quiet, and knowing this left as much
reproach to the demon, as distinction to the martyr. For the walls are now
standing, instead of trophies, uttering a voice clearer than a trumpet. To
those in Daphne, to those in the city, to those who arrive from far off, to
those who are with us, to those men which shall be hereafter, they declare
everything by their appearance, the wrestling, the struggle, the victory of
the martyr. For it is likely that he who dwells far off from the suburb,
when he sees the chapel of the saint deprived of a shrine, and the temple
of Apollo deprived of its roof would ask the reason of each of these
things; and then after learning the whole history would depart hence. Such
are the noble deeds of the martyr after death, wherefore I count your city

blessed, that ye have shown much zeal about this holy man. For then,
when he returned from Daphne, all our city poured forth into the road, and
the market places were empty of men, and the houses were empty of
women, and the bedchambers were destitute of maidens. Thus also every
age and each sex passed forth from the city, as if to receive a father long
absent who was returning from sojourn far away. And you indeed gave
him back to the band of fellow enthusiasts. But the grace of God did not
suffer him to remain there for good, but again removed him beyond the
river, so that many parts of the country were filled with the sweet savor
of the martyr. Neither even when he came hither was he destined to be
alone, but he quickly received, a neighbor, and a fellow-lodger, and one of
similar life. For he shared with him the same dignity, and for the sake of
religion shewed forth equal boldness. Wherefore he obtained the same
abode as he, this wonderful man being no vain imitator, as it seems, of the
martyr. For so long a time he labored there, sending letters continually to
the emperor, wearying the authorities, and bringing he ministry of the
body to bear upon the martyr. For ye know, doubtless, and remember that
when the midday summer sun possessed the heaven, he together with his
acquaintances, used to walk thither everyday, not as spectator only, but
also, as intending to be a sharer in what was going on. For he often handled
stone, and dragged a rope, and listened, in advance of the workmen
themselves, to one who wanted to erect any building, For he knew, he
knew what rewards lie in store for him for these things. And on this
account he continued doing service to the martyrs, not only by splendid
buildings nor even by continual feasts, but by a better method than these.
And what is this? He imitates their life, emulates their courage, throughout
according to his ability he keeps the image of the martyrs alive, in himself.
For see, they gave their bodies to the slaughter, he has mortified the
members of his flesh which are upon the earth. They stopped the flame of
fire, he quenched the flame of lust. They fought against the teeth of beasts,
but this man bore off the most dangerous of our passions, anger. For all
these things let us give thanks to God, because he hath thus granted us
noble martyrs, and pastors worthy of martyrs, for the perfecting of the
saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ with whom be glory, honor,
and might to the Father, with the Holy and lifegiving Spirit, now and
always, for ever and ever. Amen.

THE APOSTOLIC DECLARATION WHICH SAYS,
 "WHETHER IN PRETENSE, OR IN SINCERITY,
 CHRIST IS PREACHED:" (PHILIPPIANS 1:18),
 AND ABOUT HUMBLENESS OF MIND

INTRODUCTION

THERE is an allusion at the beginning of this Homily to some remarks
recently made on the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. These occur
in Chrysostom's fifth Homily against the Anomoeans, one of a set of
Homilies which, from internal evidence, may be assigned to the close of
the year 386, or beginning of 387. The following homily therefore was
delivered at Antioch, probably just before Christmas 386. There were
some persons who explained the words of St. Paul cited in the title as
signifying that provided Christ was preached it mattered not whether the
actual doctrines taught were true or heretical. The main object of the
homily is to vindicate the language of the Apostle from this erroneous and
mischievous interpretation.

1. When lately we made mention of the Pharisee and the publican, and
hypothetically yoked two chariots out of virtue and vice; we pointed out
each truth, how great is the gain of humbleness of mind, and how great the
damage of pride. For this, even when conjoined with righteousness and
fastings and tithes, fell behind; while that, even when yoked with sin,
outstripped the Pharisee's pair, even although the charioteer it had was a
poor one. For what was worse than the publican? But all the same since he
made his soul contrite, and called himself a sinner; which indeed he was; he
surpassed the Pharisee, who had both fastings to tell of and tithes; and
was removed from any vice. On account of what, and through what?
Because even if he was removed from greed of gain and robbery, he had

rooted over his soul the mother of all evils - vain-glory and pride. On this
account Paul also exhorts and says "Let each one prove his own work; and
then he will have his ground of boasting for himself, and not for the other."
Whereas he publicly came forward as an accuser of the whole world; and
said that he himself was better than all living men. And yet even if he had
set himself before ten only, or if five, or if two, or if one, not even was this
endurable; but as it was, he not only set himself before the whole world,
but also accused all men. On this account he fell behind in the running.
And just as a ship, after having run through innumerable surges, and having
escaped many storms, then in the very mouth of the harbor having been
dashed against some rock, loses the whole treasure which is stowed away
in her - so truly did this Pharisee, after having undergone the labors of
the fasting, and of all the rest of his virtue, since he did not master his
tongue, in the very harbor underwent shipwreck of his cargo. For the going
home from prayer, whence he ought to have derived gain, having rather
been so greatly damaged, is nothing else than undergoing shipwreck in
harbor.

2. Knowing therefore these things, beloved even if we should have
mounted to the very pinnacle of virtue, let us consider ourselves last of all;
having learned that pride is able to cast down even from the heavens
themselves him who takes not heed, and humbleness of mind to bear up on
high from, the very abyss of sins him who knows how to be sober. For
this it was that placed the publican before the Pharisee; whereas that,
pride I mean and an overweening spirit, surpassed even an incorporeal
power, that of the devil; while humbleness of mind and the
acknowledgment of his own sins committed brought the robber into
Paradise before the Apostles. Now if the confidence which they who
confess their own sins effect for themselves is so great, they who are
conscious to themselves of many good qualities, yet humble their own
souls, how great crowns will they not win. For when sinfulness be put
together with humbleness of mind it runs with such ease as to pass and
out-strip righteousness combined with pride. If therefore thou have put it
to with righteousness, whither will it not reach? through how many
heavens will it not pass? By the throne of God itself surely it will stay its
course; in the midst of the angels, with much confidence. On the other
hand if pride, having been yoked with righteousness, by the excess and

weight of its own wickedness had strength enough to drag down its
confidence; if it be put together with sinfulness, into how deep a hell will
it not be able to precipitate him who has it? These things I say, not in
order that we should be careless of righteousness, but that we should avoid
pride; not that we should sin, but that we should be sober-minded. For
humbleness of mind is the foundation of the love of wisdom which
pertains to us. Even if thou shouldest have built a superstructure of things
innumerable; even if almsgiving, even if prayers, even if fastings, even if all
virtue; unless this have first been laid as a foundation, all will be built upon
it to no purpose and in vain; and it will fall down easily, like that building
which had been placed on the sand. For there is no one, no one of our good
deeds, which does not need this; there is no one which separate from this
will be able to stand. But even if thou shouldest mention temperance, even
if virginity, even if despising of money, even if anything whatever, all are
unclean and accursed and loathsome, humbleness of mind being absent.
Everywhere therefore let us take her with us, in words, in deeds, in
thoughts, and with this let us build these (graces).

3. But the things belonging to humbleness of mind have been sufficiently
spoken of; not for the value of the virtue; for no one will be able to
celebrate it in accordance with its value; but for the intelligence of your
love. For well do I know that even from the few things that have been said
you will embrace it with much zeal. But since it is also necessary to make
clear and manifest the apostolic saying which has been today read; seeming
as it does to many to afford a pretext for indolence; so that some may not,
providing for themselves hence a certain frigid defense, neglect their own
salvation - to this let us direct our discourse. What then is this saying?
"Whether in pretense," it says, "or in sincerity, Christ is preached." This
many wrest absolutely, and just as happens, without reading what
precedes and what comes after it; but having cut it off from the sequence
of the remaining members, to the destruction of their own soul they put it
forward to the more indolent. For attempting to seduce them from the
sound faith; then seeing them afraid and trembling; on the ground of its not
being without danger to do this, and desiring to relieve their fears, they
bring forward this apostolic declaration, saying, Paul conceded this, by
saying, "Whether in pretense or in sincerity, let Christ be proclaimed."
But these things are not (true), they are not. For in the first place he did

not say "let him be proclaimed," but "he is proclaimed," and the difference
between this and that is wide. For the saying "let him be proclaimed"
belongs to a lawgiver; but the saying "he is proclaimed" to one announcing
the event. For that Paul does not ordain a law that there should be
heresies, but draws away all who attended to him, hear what he says, "If
any one preaches to you a gospel besides what ye have received, let him
be anathema, were it even I, were it even an angel from the heavens." Now
he would not have anathematized both himself and an angel, if he had
known the act to be without danger. And again - "I am jealous of you
with a jealousy of God," he says; "for I have betrothed you to one
husband a chaste virgin: and fear lest at some time, as the serpent beguiled
Eve by his wiliness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the
singleness that is towards Christ." See, he both set down singleness, and
granted no allowance. For if there were allowance, there was no danger;
and if there was no danger Paul would not have feared: and Christ would
not also have commanded that the tares should be burned up, if it were a
thing indifferent to attend to this one or that or another; or to all
indiscriminately.

4. What ever then is what is meant? I wish to narrate to you the whole
history from a point a little earlier; for it is needful to know in what
circumstances Paul was when he was writing these things by letter. In
what circumstances therefore was he? In prison and chains and intolerable
perils. Whence is this manifest? From the epistle itself. For earlier than
this he says, "Now I wish you to know, brethren, that the circumstances
in which I am have come rather to the furtherance of the Gospel; so that
my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole Court, and to all
the others; and a good many of the brethren, trusting to my bonds, the
more exceedingly dare fearlessly to speak the word." Now Nero had then
cast him into prison. For just as some robber having set foot in the house,
while all are sleeping, when stealing every thing, if he see any one having
lit a lamp, both extinguishes the light and slays him who holds the lamp, in
order that he may be allowed in security to steal and rob the property of
others; so truly also the Caesar Nero then, just as any robber and burglar
while all were sleeping a deep and unconscious slumber; robbing the
property of all, breaking into marriage chambers, subverting houses,
displaying every form of wickedness; when he saw Paul having lighted a

lamp throughout the world; (the word of his teaching;) and reproving his
wickedness, exerted himself both to extinguish what was preached, and to
put the teachers out of the way; in order that he might be allowed with
authority to do anything he pleased; and after binding that holy man, cast
him into prison. It was at that time then that the blessed Paul wrote these
things. Who would not have been astounded? who would not have
marveled? or rather who could adequately have been astounded at and
admired that noble and heaven-reaching soul; in that, while bound in Rome
and imprisoned, at so great a distance as that, he wrote a letter to the
Philippians? For you know how great is the distance between Macedonia
and Rome. But neither did the length of the way, nor the amount of time
(required), nor the press of business, nor the peril and the dangers coming
one upon another, nor anything else, drive out his love for and
remembrance of the disciples; but he retained them all in his mind; and not
so strongly were his hands bound with the chains as his soul was bound
together and riveted by his longing for the disciples: which very thing itself
indeed also declaring, in the preface of the Epistle he said, "On account of
my having you in my heart, both in my bonds, and in the defense and
confirmation of the Gospel." And just as a King, having ascended upon his
throne at morning-tide and taken his seat in the royal courts, immediately
receives from all quarters innumerable letters; so truly he also, just as in
royal courts, seated in the dungeon, both received and sent his letters in far
greater number; the nations from all quarters referring to his wisdom every
thing about what had taken place among themselves; and he administered
more business than the reigning monarch in proportion to his having had a
larger dominion entrusted to him. For in truth God had brought and put
into his hands not those who inhabited the country of the Romans only,
but also all the barbarians, both land and sea. And by way of showing this
he said to the Romans, "Now I would not that ye should be ignorant,
brethren, that ofttimes I have purposed to come to you, and have been
hindered until the present; in order that I might have some fruit also among
you, as among the rest of the Gentiles too. Both to Greeks and barbarians,
both to wise and those without understanding I am a debtor." Every day
therefore he was in anxious thought at one moment for Corinthians, at
another for Macedonians; how Philippians, how Cappadocians, how
Galatians, how Athenians, how they who inhabited Pontus. how all
together were. But all the same, having had the whole world put into his

hands, he continually cared not for entire nations only, but also for each
single man; and now indeed he dispatched a letter on behalf of Onesimus,
and now on behalf of him who among the Corinthians had committed
fornication. For neither used he to regard this - that it was the individual
who had sinned and needed advocacy; but that it was a human being; a
human being, the living thing most precious to God; and for whose sake
the Father had not spared even the Only-begotten.

5. For do not tell me that this or that man is a runaway slave, or a robber
or thief, or laden with countless faults, or that he is a mendicant and abject,
or of low value and worthy of no account; but consider that for his sake
the Christ died; and this sufficeth thee for a ground for all solicitude.
Consider what sort of person he must be, whom Christ valued at so high a
price as not to have spared even his own blood. For neither, if a king had
chosen to sacrifice himself on any one's behalf, should we have sought out
another demonstration of his being some one great and of deep interest to
the King - I fancy not - for his death would suffice to show the love of
him who had died towards him. But as it is not man, not angel, not
archangel; but the Lord of the heavens himself, the only-begotten Son of
God himself having clothed himself with flesh, freely gave himself on our
behalf. Shall we not do everything, and take every trouble, so that the men
who have been thus valued may enjoy every solicitude at our hands? And
what kind of defense shall we have? what allowance? This at least is the
very thing by way of declaring which Paul also said, "Do not by thy meat
destroy him for whose sake Christ died." For desiring to shame, and to
bring to solicitude, and to persuade to care for their neighbors, those who
despise their brethren, and look down upon them as being weak, instead of
all else he set down the Master's death.

Sitting then in the prison he wrote the letter to the Philippians from that
so great distance. For such as this is the love that is according to God: it is
interrupted by no one of human things, since it has its roots from above in
the heavens and its recompense. And what says he? "Now I desire that ye
should know, brethren" Seest thou solicitude for his scholars? seest thou a
teacher's carefulness? Hear too of loving affection of scholars towards
their teacher, that thou mayest know that this was what made them strong
and unconquerable - the being bound together with one another. For if
"Brother helped by brother is as a strong city;" far more so many bound

together by the bonds of love would have entirely repulsed the plotting of
the wicked demon. That indeed then Paul was bound up with the
disciples, requires not even any demonstration further nor argument for us,
since in truth even when in bonds he anxiously cared for them, and each
day, he was also dying for them, burning with his longing.

6. And that the disciples too were bound up with Paul with all
perfectness; and that not men only but women also, hear what he says
about Phoebe. "Now I commend to you Phoebe the sister, being a
deaconess of the Church which is in Cenchreae; that ye may receive her in
the Lord worthily of the saints, and stand by her, in whatever matter she
may require you, since she has proved a helper of many; and of me
myself." But in this instance he bore witness to her of her zeal so far as
help went (only;) but Priscilla and Aquila went as far even as death for
Paul's sake; and about them he thus writes, saying, "Aquila and Priscilla
salute you, who for my life's sake laid down their own neck;" for death
clearly. And about another again writing to these very persons he says,
"Because he went as far as death; having counseled ill for his life, in order
that he might supply your deficiency in your service towards me. Seest
thou how they loved their teacher? how they regarded his rest before their
own life? On this account no one surpassed them then. Now this I say,
not that we may hear only, but that we may also imitate; and not to the
ruled only, but also to those who rule is what we say addressed; in order
that both scholars may display much solicitude about their teachers, and
the teachers may have the same loving affection as Paul about those placed
under them; not those present only, but also those who are far off. For
also Paul, dwelling in the whole world just as in one house, thus
continually took thought for the salvation of all; and having dismissed
every thing of his own; bonds and troubles and stripes and straits,
watched over and inquired into each day, in what state the affairs of the
disciples were; and often for this very purpose alone sent, now Timothy,
and now Tychicus; and about him he says, "That he may know your
circumstances, and encourage your hearts:" and about Timothy; "I have
sent him, being no longer able to contain myself; lest in some way the
tempter have tempted you." And Titus again elsewhere, and another to
another place. For since he himself, by the compulsion of his bonds being

often detained in one place, was unable to meet those who were his vitals,
he met them through the disciples.

7. And then therefore being in bonds he writes to the Philippians, saying,
"Now I desire that ye should know, brethren," calling the disciples
brethren. For such a thing as this is love; it casts out all inequality, and
knows not superiority and dignity; but even if one be higher than all, he
descends to the lowlier position of all; just what Paul also used to do. But
let us hear what it is that he desires they should know. "That the things
which happened unto me," he says, "have fallen out rather to the
furtherance of the gospel." Tell me, how and in what way? Hast thou then
been released from thy bonds? hast thou then put off thy chain? and dost
thou with free permission preach in the city? hast thou then, having gone
into an assembly, drawn out many long discourses about the faith, and
departed after gaining many disciples? hast thou then raised the dead and
been made an object of wonder? hast thou then cleansed lepers, and all
were astounded? hast thou driven away demons, and been exalted? No one
of these things, he says. How then did the furtherance of the gospel take
place? tell me. "So that my bonds," he says, "have become openly known
in the whole Court, and to all the rest." What sayest thou? this then, this
was the furtherance, this the advance, this the increase of the proclamation
- that all knew that thou wast bound. Yes, he says: Hear at least what
comes next, that thou mayest learn that the bonds not only proved no
hindrance, but also a ground of greater freedom of speech. "So that several
of the brethren in the Lord, in reliance on my bonds, more abundantly dare
fearlessly to speak the word." What sayest thou, O Paul? have thy bonds
inspired not anxiety but confidence? not fear but earnest longing? The
things mentioned have no consistency.I too know it. For neither did these
things take place according to the consistency of human affairs, he means,
but what came about was above nature, and the successes were of divine
grace. On this account what used to cause anxiety to all others, that to him
afforded confidence. For also if any one, having taken the leader of an
army land confined him, have made this publicly known, he throws the
whole camp into flight; and if any one have carried a shepherd away from
the flock, the security with which he drives off the sheep is great. But not
in Paul's case was it thus, but the contrary entirely. For the leader of the
army was bound, and the soldiers became more forward in spirit; and the

confidence with which they sprung upon their adversaries was greater: the
shepherd was in confinement, and the sheep were not consumed, nor even
scattered.

8. Who ever saw, who ever heard of, the scholars taking greater
encouragement in the dangers of their teachers? How was it that they
feared not? how was it that they were not terrified? how was it that they
did not say to Paul, "Physician, heal thyself," deliver thyself from thy
manifold perils, and then thou will be able to procure for us those
countless good things? How was it they did not say these things? How! It
was because they had been schooled, from the grace of the Spirit, that
these things took place not out of weakness, but out of the permission of
the Christ; in order that the truth might shine abroad more largely; through
bonds and imprisonments and tribulations and straits increasing and rising,
to a greater volume. Thus is the power of Christ in weakness perfected.
For indeed if his bonds had crippled Paul and made him cowardly; either
himself or those belonging to him; one could not but feel difficulty; but if
rather they prepared him to feel confidence and brought him into greater
renown, one must be astounded and marvel, how through a thing involving
dishonor glory was procured for the disciple - through a thing inspiring
Cowardice confidence and encouragement resulted to them all. For who
was not astounded at him then, seeing him encircled with a chain? Then
demons took to flight all the more, when they saw him spending his time
in a prison. For not so splendid does the diadem make a royal head, as the
chain his hands; not owing to their proper nature, but owing to the grace
that darted brightness on them. On this account it was that great
encouragement resulted to the disciples. For also they saw his body indeed
bound, but his tongue not bound, his hands indeed tightly manacled, but
his voice unshackled, and traversing the whole world more swiftly than the
solar ray. And this became to them an encouragement; learning as they did
from the facts that no one of present things is to be dreaded. For when the
soul has been genuinely imbued by divine longing and love, it pays regard
to no one of things present; but just as those who are mad venture
themselves against fire and sword and wild beasts and sea and all else, so
these too, maddened with a most noble and most spiritual frenzy, a frenzy
arising from sanity, used to laugh at all things that are seen. On this
account, seeing their teachers bound, they the more exulted, the more

prided themselves; by facts giving to their adversaries a demonstration that
on all sides they were impregnable and indomitable.

9. Then therefore, when matters were in this state, some of the enemies of
Paul, desiring to fan up the war to greater vehemence, and to make the
hatred of the tyrant, which was fell towards him greater, pretended that
they themselves also preached; (and they did preach the right and sound
faith,) for the sake of the doctrine advancing more rapidly: and this they
did, not with the desire to disseminate the faith; but in order that Nero,
having learnt that the preaching was increasing and the doctrine advancing,
might the sooner have Paul led away to execution? There were therefore
two schools; that of Paul's scholars and that of Paul's enemies; the one
preaching out of sincerity, and the others out of love of contention and the
hatred they felt towards Paul. And by way of declaring this he said,
"Some indeed through envy and strife are preaching Christ," (pointing out
those his enemies) "but some also through good pleasure;" saying this
about his own scholars. Then next about those; "Some indeed out of
contentiousness," (his enemies,) not purely, not soundly, but, "thinking
that they are thereby bringing pressure upon my bonds; but the others out
of love;" (this again about his own brethren;) "knowing that I am set ‘for
the defense of the gospel." For what? Nevertheless, in any way; whether
in pretense or in sincerity, Christ is being announced." So that vainly and
to no purpose is this saying taken in reference to heresies. For those who
then were preaching were not preaching corrupt doctrine; but sound and
right belief. For if they were preaching corrupt doctrine, and were teaching
other things contrary to Paul, what they desired was certain not to succeed
to them. Now what did they desire? That the faith having grown, and the
disciples of Paul having become numerous, it should rouse Nero to greater
hostility. And if they were preaching different doctrines, they would not
have made the disciples of Paul numerous; and by not doing so, they
would not have exasperated the tyrant. He does not therefore say this -
that they were bringing in corrupt doctrines - but that the motive from
which they were preaching, this was corrupt. For it is one thing to state
the pretext of their preaching, and another that their preaching itself was
not sound. For the preaching does not become sound when the doctrine is
laden with deception; and the pretext does not become sound when the
preaching indeed is sound, but they who preach do not preach for the sake

of God, but either with a view of enmity, or with a view to the favor of
others.

10. He therefore does not say this - that they were bringing in heresies;
but that it was not from a right motive, nor through piety that they were
preaching what they did preach. For it was not that they might increase
the gospel that they were doing this; but that they might wage war against
him, and throw him into greater danger - on this account he accuses them.
And see how with exactitude he laid it. "Thinking," he says, "that they
were putting pressure upon my bonds." He did not say, putting, but
"thinking they were putting upon," that is supposing, by way of pointing
out that even if they so supposed, still he himself was not in such a
position; but that he even rejoiced on account of the advance of the
preaching. He added therefore saying, "But in this I both rejoice and will
rejoice:" whereas if he held their doctrines deception, and they were
bringing in heresies, Paul could not possibly rejoice. But since the doctrine
was sound and of genuine parentage, on this account he says, "I rejoice
and will rejoice." For what if they are destroying themselves by doing this
out of contentiousness? Still, even unwillingly, they are strengthening my
cause. Seest thou how great is Paul's power? how he is caught by no one
of the devil's machinations? And not only is he not caught; but also by
these themselves he subdues him. For great indeed is both the devil's
craftiness, and the wickedness of those who minister to him; for under
pretense of being of the same mind, they desired to extinguish the
proclamation But "he who seizes the cunning in their craftiness" did not
permit that this should take place then. By way of declaring this very
thing at least Paul said "But the continuing in the flesh is the more
necessary for your sake; and this I confidently know, that I shall continue
and remain in company with you all." For those men indeed set their mind
on casting me out of the present life, and are ready to endure anything for
this object; but God does not permit it on your account.

11. These things therefore, all of them, remember with exactness in order
that you may be able with all wisdom to correct those who use the
Scriptures without reference to circumstances and at hap-hazard, and for
the destruction of their neighbors. And we shall be able both to remember
what has been said, and to correct others, if we always betake ourselves to
prayers as a refuge, and beseech the God who gives the word of wisdom to

grant both intelligence in hearing, and a careful and unconquerable
guardianship of this spiritual deposit in our hands. For things which often
we have not strength to perform successfully from our own exertions,
these we shall have power to accomplish easily through prayers. I mean
prayers which are persevering. For always and without intermission it is a
duty to pray, both for him who is in affliction, and him who is in relief
from it, and him who is in dangers, and him who is in prosperity - for
him who is in relief and much prosperity, that these may remain unmoved
and without vicissitude, and may never change; and for him who is in
affliction and his many dangers, that he may see some favorable change
brought about to him, and be transported into a calm of consolation. Art
thou in a calm? Then beseech God that this calm may continue settled to
thee. Hast thou seen a storm risen up against thee? Beseech God earnestly
to cause the billow to pass, and to make a calm out of the storm. "Hast
thou been heard? Be heartily thankful for this; because thou hast been
heard. Hast thou not been heard? Persevere in order that thou mayest be
heard. For even if God at any time delay the giving, it is not in hatred and
aversion; but from the desire by the deferring of the giving perpetually to
retain thee with himself; just in the way also that affectionate fathers do;
for they also adroitly manage the perpetual and assiduous attendance of
children who are rather indolent by the delay of the giving. There is to thee
no need of mediators in audience with God; nor of that much canvassing;
nor of the fawning upon others; but even if thou be destitute, even if bereft
of advocacy, alone, by thyself, having called on God for help, thou wilt in
any case succeed. He is not so wont to assent when entreated by others on
our behalf, as by ourselves who are in need; even if we be laden with ten
thousand evil deeds. For if in the case of men, even if we have come into
countless collisions with them, when both at dawn and at mid-day and in
the evening we show ourselves to those who are aggrieved against us, by
the unbroken continuance and the persistent meeting and interview we
easily demolish their enmity - far more in the case of God would this be
effected.

12. But thou art unworthy. Become worthy by thy assiduity. For that it
both is possible that the unworthy should become worthy from his
assiduity; and that God assents more when called on by ourselves than by
others; and that he often delays the giving, not from the wish that we

should be utterly perplexed, nor to send us out with empty hands; but in
order that he may become the author of greater good things to us - these
three points I will endeavor to make evident by the parable which has
today been read to you. The woman of Chanaan had come to Christ
praying on behalf of a daughter possessed by a demon, and crying out
with much earnestness, (it says, "Have pity on me, Lord, my daughter is
badly possessed by a demon." See, the woman of a strange nation, and a
barbarian, and outside of the Jewish commonwealth. For indeed what else
(was she) than a dog, and unworthy of the receiving her request? For "it is
not," he says, "good to take the children's bread, and to give it to the
dogs." But, all the same, from her assiduity, she became worthy. For not
only did he admit her into the nobility of children, dog as she was; but also
he sent her off with that high encomium saying, "O woman great is thy
faith; be it done to thee as thou wilt." Now when the Christ says, "great is
thy faith," seek thou no other demonstration of the greatness of soul
which was in the woman. Seest thou how, from her assiduity the woman,
being unworthy, became worthy? Desirest thou also to learn that we
accomplish (our wish) by calling on him by ourselves more than by
others? She cried out, and the disciples having come to him say, "Let her
go away, for she is crying after us:" and to them he says, "I am not sent,
unless to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." But when she had come to
him by herself and continued crying, and saying, "Yes, Lord, for even the
dogs eat from the table of their masters," then he granted the favor and
says, "Be it done unto thee as thou wilt." Seest thou how, when they were
entreating him, he repelled; but when she who needed the gift herself cried
out, he assented? For to them he says, "I am not sent, unless to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel;" but to her he said, "Great is thy faith; be it
done unto thee as thou wilt." Again, at the beginning and in the prelude of
her request he answered nothing; but when both once and twice and thrice
she had come to him, then he granted the boon; by the issue making us
believe that he had delayed the giving, not that be might repel her but that
he might display to us all the woman's endurance. For if he had delayed in
order that he might repel her, he would not have granted it even at the end;
but since he was waiting to display to all her spiritual wisdom, on this
accouter he was silent. For if he had granted it immediately and at the
beginning, we should not have known the woman's virtue. "Let her go" it
says, "because she is clamoring behind us." But what (says) the Christ?

"Ye hear a voice, but I see the mind: I know what she is going to say. I
choose not to permit the treasure hidden in her mind to escape notice; but
I am waiting and keeping silence; in order that having discovered it I may
lay it down in publicity, and make it manifest to all.

13. Having therefore learned all these things, even if we be in sins, and
unworthy of receiving, let us not despair; knowing, that by assiduity of
soul we shall be able to become worthy of the request. Even if we be
unaided by advocate and destitute, let us not faint; knowing that it is a
strong advocacy - the coming to God one's self by one's self with much
eagerness. Even if he delay and defer with respect to the giving, let us not
be dispirited; having learned that the putting it off and delay is a sure
proof of caring and love for mankind. If we have thus persuaded ourselves;
and with a soul deeply pained and fervent, and thoroughly roused
purpose; and such as that with which the woman of Chanaan approached,
we too come to him, even if we be dogs; even if we have done anything
whatever dreadful; we shall both rebut our own crimes, and obtain so great
liberty of speech as also to be advocates for others; in the way in which
also this woman of Chanaan not only herself enjoyed liberty of speech and
ten thousand encomiums, but had power to snatch her dear daughter out of
her intolerable sufferings. For nothing - nothing is more powerful than
prayer when fervent and genuine. This both disperses present dangers, and
rescues from the penalties which take place at that hour. That therefore we
may both complete our passage through the present life with ease, and
depart thither with confidence, with much zeal and eagerness let us
perform this perpetually. For thus shall we be able both to attain the good
things which are laid up, and to enjoy those excellent hopes; which God
grant that we may all attain; by the grace and loving kindness and
compassion of our Lord Jesus Christ - with whom to the Father together
with the Holy Spirit be glory, honor, dominion, to the ages of the ages.
Amen.

FIRST INSTRUCTION

To those about to be illuminated; and for what reason the layer is said to
be of regeneration and not of remission of sins; and that it is a dangerous
thing not only to forswear oneself, but also to take an oath, even though
we swear truly.

1. How delightful and lovable is our band of young brethren! For brethren
I call you, even now before you have been brought forth, and before your
birth I welcome this relationship with you: For I know, I know dearly, to
how great an honor you are about to be led, and to how great a dignity; and
those who are about to receive dignity, all are wont to honor, even before
the dignity is conferred, laying up for themselves beforehand by their
attention good will for the future. And this also I myself now do. For ye
are not about to be led to an empty dignity, but to an actual kingdom: and
not simply to a kingdom, but to the kingdom of the Heavens itself.
Wherefore I beseech and entreat you that you remember me when you
come into that kingdom, and as Joseph said to the chief butler "Remember
me when it shall be well with thee," this also I say now to you, do ye
remember me when it is well with you. I do not ask this in return for
interpreting your dreams, as he; for I have not come to interpret dreams
for you, but to discourse of matters celestial, and to convey to you glad
tidings of such good things as "eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard
and which have entered not into the heart of man, such are the things
which God hath prepared for them that love him." Now Joseph indeed
said to that chief butler, "yet three days and Pharaoh will restore thee to
thy chief butlership." But I do not say, yet three days and ye shall be set
to pour out the wine of a tyrant, but yet thirty days, and not Pharaoh but
the king of Heaven shall restore you to the country which is on high,
Jerusalem, which is free - to the city which is in the heavens; and he said
indeed, "Thou shalt give the cup into the hands of Pharaoh." But I say not

that you shall give the cup into the hands of the king, but that the king
shall give the cup into your hand - that dread cup, full of much power,
and more precious than any created thing. The initiated know the virtue of
this cup, and you yourselves shall know it a little while hence. Remember
me, therefore, when you come into that kingdom, when you receive the
royal robe, when you are girt with the purple dipped in the master's
blood, when you will be crowned with the diadem, which has luster
leaping forth from it on all sides, more brilliant than the rays of the sun.
Such are the gifts of the Bridegroom, greater indeed than your worth, but
worthy of his lovingkindness.

Wherefore, I count you blessed already before those sacred nuptials, and I
do not only count you blessed, but I praise your prudence in that you
have not come to your illumination as the most slothful among men, at
your last breath, but already, like prudent servants, prepared with much
goodwill to obey your master, have brought the neck of your soul with
much meekness and readiness beneath the bands of Christ, and have
received His easy yoke, and have taken His light burden. For if the grace
bestowed be the same both for you and for those who are initiated at their
last hour, yet the matter of the intention is not the same, nor yet the
matter of the preparation for the rite. For they indeed receive it on their
bed, but you in the bosom of the Church, which is the common mother of
us all; they indeed with lamentation and weeping, but you rejoicing, and
exceeding glad: they sighing, you giving thanks; they indeed lethargic with
much fever, you filled with much spiritual pleasure; wherefore in your
case all things are in harmony with the gift, but in theirs all are adverse to
it. For there is wailing and much lamentation on the part of the initiated,
and children stand around crying, wife tearing her cheeks, and dejected
friends and tearful servants; the whole aspect Of the house resembles
some wintry and gloomy day. And if thou shalt open the heart of him who
is lying there, thou wilt find it more downcast than are these. For as winds
meeting one another with many a contrary blast, break up the sea into
many parts, so too the thought of the terrors preying upon him assail the
Soul of the sick man, and distract his mind with many anxieties. Whenever
he sees his children, he thinks of their fatherless condition; whenever he
looks from them to his wife, he considers her widowhood; when he sees
the servants, he beholds the desolation of the whole house; when he comes

back to him self, he calls to mind his own present life, and being about to
be torn from it, experiences a great cloud of despondency. Of such a kind
is the soul of him who is about to be initiated. Then in the midst of its
tumult and confusion, the Priest enters, more formidable than the fever
itself, and more distressing than death to the relatives of the sick man. For
the entrance of the Presbyter is thought to be a greater reason for despair
than the voice of the physician despairing Of his life, and that which
suggests eternal life seems to be a symbol of death. But I have not yet put
the finishing stroke to these ills. For in the midst of relatives raising a
tumult and making preparations, the soul has often taken its flight, leaving
the body desolate; and in many cases, while it was present it was useless,
for when it neither recognizes those who are present, nor hears their voice,
nor is able to answer those words by which it will make that blessed
covenant with the common master of us all, but is as a useless log, or a
stone, and he who is about to be illuminated lies there differing nothing
from a corpse, what is the profit of initiation in a case of such
insensibility?

2. For he who is about to approach these holy and dread mysteries must
be awake and alert, must be clean from all cares of this life, full of much
self-restraint, much readiness; he must banish from his mind every thought
foreign to the mysteries, and on all sides cleanse and prepare his home, as
if about to receive the king himself. Such is the preparation of your mind:
such are your thoughts; such the purpose of your soul. Await therefore a
return worthy of this most excellent decision from God, who overpowers
with His recompense those who show forth obedience to Him. But since it
is necessary for his fellow servants to contribute of their own, then we
will contribute of our own; yea rather not even are these things our own,
but these too are our Master's. "For what hast thou," saith He, "that thou
didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if
thou hadst not received it?" I wished to say this first of all, why in the
world our fathers, passing by the whole year, settled that the children of
the Church should be initiated at this season; and for what reason, after the
instruction from us, removing your shoes and raiment, unclad and unshod,
with but one garment on, they conduct you to hear the words of the
exorcisers. For it is not thoughtlessly and rashly that they have planned
this dress and this season for us. But both these things have a certain

mystic and secret reason. And I wished to say this to you. But I see that
our discourse now constrains us to something more necessary. For it is
necessary to say what baptism is, and for what reason it enters into our
life, and what good things it conveys to us.

But, if you will, let us discourse about the name which this mystic
cleansing bears: for its name is not one, but very many and various. For
this purification is called the layer of regeneration. "He saved us," he saith,
"through the laver of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost." It is
called also illumination, and this St. Paul again has called it, "For call to
remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye
endured a great conflict of sufferings;" and again, "For it is impossible for
those who were once illuminated, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and
then fell away, to renew them again unto repentance." It is called also,
baptism: "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on
Christ." It is called also burial: "For we were buried" saith he, "with him,
through baptism, into death." It is called circumcision: "In whom ye were
also circumcised, with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting
off of the body of the sins of the flesh." It is called a cross: "Our old man
was crucified with him that the body of sin might be done away." It is also
possible to speak of other names besides these, but in order that we
should not spend our whole time over the names of this free gift, come,
return to the first name, and lotus finish our discourse by declaring its
meaning; but in the meantime, let us extend our teaching a little further.
There is that layer by means of the baths, common to all men, which is
wont to wipe off bodily uncleanness; and there is the Jewish layer, more
honorable than the other, but far inferior to that of grace; and it too wipes
off bodily uncleanness, but not simply uncleanness of body, since it even
reaches to the weak conscience. For there are many matters, which by
nature indeed are not unclean, but which become unclean from the
weakness of the conscience. And as in the ease of little children, masks,
and other bugbears are not in themselves alarming, but seem to little
children to be alarming, by reason of the weakness of their nature, so it is
in the case of those things of which I was speaking; just as to touch dead
bodies is not naturally unclean, but when this comes into contact with a
weak conscience, it makes him who touches them unclean. For that the
thing in question is not unclean naturally, Moses himself who ordained

this law showed, when he bore off the entire corpse of Joseph, and yet
remained clean. On this account Paul also, discoursing to us about this
uncleanness which does not come naturally but by reason of the weakness
of the conscience, speaks somewhat in this way, "Nothing is common of
itself save to him who accounteth anything to be common." Dost thou not
see that uncleanness does not arise from the nature of the thing, but from
the weakness of the reasoning about it? And again: "All things indeed are
clean, howbeit it is evil to that man who eateth with offense." Dost thou
see that it is not to eat, but to eat with offense, that is the cause of
uncleanness?

3. Such is the defilement from which the layer of the Jews cleansed. But
the layer of grace, not such, but the real uncleanness which has introduced
defilement into the soul as well as into the body. For it does not make
those who have touched dead bodies dean, but those who have set their
hand to dead works: and if any man be effeminate, or a fornicator, or an
idolator, or a doer of whatever ill you please, or if he be full of all the
wickedness there is among men: should he fall into this pool of waters, he
comes up again from the divine fountain purer than the sun's rays. And in
order that thou mayest not think that what is said is mere vain boasting,
hear Paul speaking of the power of the layer, "Be not deceived: neither
idolators, nor fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of
themselves with men, nor covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not
extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God." And what has this to do
with what has been spoken? says one, "for prove the question whether
the power of the laver thoroughly cleanses all these things." Hear therefore
what follows: "And such were some of you, but ye were washed, but ye
were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and in the spirit of our God." We promise to show you that they who
approach the lover become clean from all fornication: but the word has
shown more, that they have become not only clean, but both holy and
just, for it does not say only "ye were washed," but also "ye were
sanctified and were justified." What could be more strange than this, when
without toil, and exertion, and good works, righteousness is produced? For
such is the lovingkindness of the Divine gift that it makes men just
without this exertion. For if a letter of the Emperor, a few words being
added, sets free those who are liable to countless accusations, and brings

others to the highest honors; much rather will the Holy Spirit of God, who
is able to do all things, free us from all evil and grant us much
righteousness, and fill us with much assurance, and as a spark falling into
the wide sea would straightway be quenched, or would become invisible,
being overwhelmed by the multitude of the waters, so also all human
wickedness, when it falls into the pool of the divine fountain, is more
swiftly and easily overwhelmed, and made invisible, than that spark. And
for what reason, says one, if the layer take away all our sins, is it called,
not a layer of remission of sins, nor a laver of cleansing, but a laver of
regeneration? Because it does not simply take away our sins, nor simply
cleanse us from our faults, but so as if we were born again. For it creates
and fashions us anew not forming us again out of earth, but creating us out
of another element, namely, of the nature of water. For it does not simply
wipe the vessel clean, but entirely remolds it again. For that which is
wiped clean, even if it be cleaned with care, has traces of its former
condition, and bears the remains of its defilement, but that which fails into
the new mold, and is renewed by means of the flames, laying aside all
uncleanness, comes forth from the furnace, and sends forth the same
brilliancy with things newly formed. As therefore any one who takes and
recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust,
rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature
of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from
our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning
bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and
throwing it into the waters as into a mold, and instead of fire sending forth
the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed,
and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man,
and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.

4. And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the
prophet of old said, "Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's
vessel." For that the word is in reference to the faithful, what goes before
sufficiently shows us, "For thou art my Son," he says, "today have I
begotten thee, ask of me and I will give the heathen for three inheritance,
the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession." Dost thou see how he
has made mention of the church of the Gentiles, and has spoken of the
kingdom of Christ extended on all sides? Then he says again, "Thou shall

rule them with a rod of iron;" not grievous, but strong: "thou shalt break
them in pieces like a potter's vessel." Behold then, the layer is more
mystically brought forward. For he does not say earthen vessels: but
vessels of the potter. But, give heed: For earthen vessels when crushed
would not admit of refashioning, on account of the hardness which was
gained by them from the fire. But the fact is that the vessels of the potter
are not earthen, but of clay; wherefore, also, when they have been
distorted, they can easily, by the skill of the artificer, be brought again to a
second shape. When, therefore, God speaks of an irremediable calamity, he
does not say vessels of the potter, but an earthen vessel; when, for
instance, he wished to teach the prophet and the Jews that he delivered up
the city to an irremediable calamity, he bade him take an earthen
wine-vessel, and crush it before all the people, and say, "Thus shall this
city be destroyed, be broken in pieces." But when he wishes to hold out
good hopes to them, he brings the prophet to a pottery, and does not
show him an earthen vessel, but shows him a vessel of clay, which was in
the hands of the potter, falling to the ground: and brings him to it saying,
"If this potter has taken up and remodeled his vessel which has fallen,
shall I not much rather be able to restore you when you have fallen?" It is
possible therefore for God not only to restore those who are made of clay,
through the layer of regeneration, but to bring back again to their original
state, on their careful repentance, those who have received the power of
the Spirit, and have lapsed. But this is not the time for you to hear words
about repentance, rather may the time never come for you to fall into the
need of these remedies, but may you always remain in preservation of the
beauty and the brightness which ye are now about to receive, unsullied. In
order, then, that ye may ever remain thus, come and let us discourse to
you a little about your manner of life. For in the wrestling schools falls of
the athletes are devoid of danger. For the wrestling is with friends, and
they practice all their exercises on the persons of their teachers. But when
the time of the contest has come, when the lists are open, when the
spectators are seated above, when the president has arrived, it necessarily
follows that the combatants, if they become careless, fall and retire in great
disgrace, or if they are in earnest, win the crowns and the prizes. So then,
in your case these thirty days are like some wrestling school, both for
exercise and practice: let us learn from thence already to get the better of
that evil demon. For it is to contend with him that we have to strip

ourselves, with him after baptism are we to box and fight. Let us learn
from thence already his grip, on what side he is aggressive, on what side he
can easily threaten us, in order that, when the contest comes on, we may
not feel strange, nor become confused, as seeing new forms of wrestling;
but having already practiced them amongst ourselves, and having learnt all
his methods, may engage in these forms of wrestling against him with
courage. In all ways, therefore, is he accustomed to threaten us, but
especially by means of the tongue, and the mouth. For there is no organ so
convenient for him for our deception and our destruction as an
unchastened tongue and an unchecked utterance. Hence come many slips
on our part: hence many serious accusations against us. And the ease of
these falls through the tongue a certain one showed, when he said, "Many
fell by the sword, but not so many as by the tongue." Now the gravity of
the fall the same person shows us again when he says: "To slip upon a
pavement is better than to slip with the tongue." And what he speaks of is
of this kind. Better it is, says he, that the body should fall and be crushed,
than that such a word should go forth as destroys the soul; and he does
not speak of falls merely; he also admonishes us that much forethought
should be exercised, so that we should not be tripped up, thus saying
"Make a door and bars for thy mouth," not that we should prepare doors
and bars, but that with much security, we should shut the tongue off from
outrageous words; and again in another place, after showing that we need
influence from above, both as accompanying and preceding our own effort
so as to keep this wild beast within: stretching forth his hands to God, the
prophet said, "Let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice, set a
watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips;" and he who
before admonished, himself too says again, "Who shall set a watch before
my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips?" Dost thou not see, each
one fearing these fails and bewailing them, both giving advice, and praying
that the tongue may have the benefit of much watchfulness? and for what
reason, says one, if this organ brings us such ruin, did God originally place
it within us? Because indeed, it is of great use, and if we are careful, it is of
use only, and brings no ruin. Hear, for example, what he says who spoke
the former words, "Death and life are in the power of the tongue." And
Christ points to the same thing when he says, "By thy words thou shalt
be condemned, and by thy words thou shalt be justified." For the tongue
stands in the midst ready for use on either hand. "Thou art its master.

Thus indeed a sword lies in the midst, and if thou use it against thine
enemies, this organ becomes a means of safety for thee. But if thou thrust
its stroke against thyself, not the nature of the iron, but thine own
transgression becomes the cause of thy slaughter. Let us then take this
view of the tongue. It is a sword lying in the midst; sharpen it for the
purpose of accusing thine own sins. Thrust not the stroke against thy
brother. For this reason God surrounded it with a double fortification;
with the fence of the teeth and the barrier of the lips, that it may not
rashly and without circumspection utter words which are not convenient.
Well, dost thou say it will not endure this? Bridle it therefore within.
Restrain it by means of the teeth, as though giving over its body to these
executioners and making them bite it. For it is better that when it sins now
it should be bitten by the teeth, than one day when it seeks a drop of
water and is parched with heat, to be unable to obtain this consolation. In
many other ways indeed it is wont to sin, by raillery and blasphemy, by
uttering foul words, by slander, swearing, and perjury.

5. But in order that we may not by saying everything at once today,
confuse your minds, we put before you one custom, namely, about the
avoidance of oaths, saying this much by way of preface, and speaking
plainly - that if you do not avoid oaths, I say not perjury merely, but
those too which happen in the cause of justice, we shall not further
discourse upon any other subject. For it is monstrous that teachers of
letters should not give a second lesson to their children until they see the
former one fixed well in their memory, but that we, without being able to
express our first lessons clearly, should inculcate others before the first are
completed. For this is nothing else than to pour into a perforated jar. Give
great care, then, that ye silence not our mouth. For this error is grave, and
it is exceedingly grave because it does not seem to be grave, and on this
account I fear it, because no one fears it. On this account the disease is
incurable, because it does not seem to be a disease; but just as simple
speech is not a crime, so neither does this seem to be a crime, but with
much boldness this transgression is committed: and if any one call it in
question, straightway laughter follows, and much ridicule, not of those
who are called in question for their oaths, but of those who wish to rectify
the disease. On this account I largely extend my discourse about these
matters. For I wish to pull up a deep root, and to wipe out a long-standing

evil: I speak not of perjury alone, but even of oaths in good faith. But so
and so, says one, a forbearing man, consecrated to the priesthood, living in
much self-control and piety, takes an oath. Do not speak to me of this
forbearing person, this self-controlled, pious man who is consecrated to
the priesthood; but if thou wilt, add that this man is Peter, or Paul, or even
an angel descended out of heaven. For not even in such a case do I regard
the dignity of their persons. For the law which I read upon oaths, is not
that of the servant, but of the King: and when the edicts of a king are read,
let every claim of the servants be silent. But if thou art able to say that
Christ bade us use oaths, or that Christ did not punish the doing of this,
show me, and I am persuaded. But if he forbids it with so much care, and
takes so much thought about the matter as to class him who takes an oath
with the evil one (for whatsoever is more than these, namely, than yea and
nay, saith he, is of the devil), why dost thou bring this person and that
person forward? For not because of the carelessness of thy fellow
servants, but from the injunctions of his own laws, will God record his
vote against thee. I have commanded, he says, thou oughtest to obey, not
to shelter thyself behind such and such a person and concern thyself with
other persons' evil. Since the great David sinned a grievous sin, is it then
safe for us to sin? Tell me: on this account then we ought to make sure of
this point, and only to emulate the good works of the saints; and if there is
carelessness, and transgression of the law anywhere, we ought to flee from
it with great care. For our reckoning is not with our fellow-servants, but
with our Master, and to him we shall give account for all done in our life.
Let us prepare ourselves therefore for this tribunal. For even if he who
transgresses this law be beyond everything revered and great, he shall
certainly pay the penalty attaching to the transgression. For God is no
respecter of persons. How then and in what way is it possible to flee from
this sin? For one ought to show not only that the crime is grievous, but to
give counsel how we may escape from it. Hast thou a wife, hast thou a
servant, children, friends, acquaintance, neighbors? To all these enjoin
caution on these matters. Custom is a grievous thing, terrible to supplant,
and hard to guard against, and it often attacks us unwilling and unknowing;
therefore in so far as thou knowest the power of custom, to such an extent
study to be freed from any evil custom, and transfer thyself to any other
most useful one. For as that custom is often able to trip thee up, though
thou art careful, and guardest thyself, and takest thought, and

consideration, so if thou transferrest thyself to the good custom of
abstaining from oaths, thou wilt not be able, either involuntarily or
carelessly, to fall into the fault of oaths. For custom is really great and has
the power of nature. In order then that we do not continually distress
ourselves let us transfer ourselves to another custom, and ask thou each
one of thy kindred and acquaintance this favor, that he advise thee and
exhort thee to flee from oaths, and reprove thee, when detected in them.
For the watch over thee which takes place on their part, is to them too
counsel and a suggestion to what is right. For he who reproves another for
oaths, will not himself easily fall into this pit. For much sweating is no
ordinary pit, not only when it is about little matters but about the greatest.
And we, whether buying vegetables, or quarrelling over two farthings, or in
a rage with our servants and threatening them, always call upon God as
our witness. But a freeman, possessed of some barren dignity, thou
wouldest not dare to call upon as witness in the market to such things; but
even if thou attemptedst it, thou wilt pay the penalty of thine insolence.
But the King of Heaven, the Lord of Angels, when disputing both about
purchases and money, and what not, thou draggest in for a testimony. And
how can these things be born? whence then should we escape from this
evil custom? After setting those guards of which I spoke round us, let us
fix on a specified time to ourselves for amendment, and adding thereto
condemnation if, when the time has passed, we have not amended this.
How long time will suffice for the purpose? I do not think that they who
are very wary, and on the alert, and watchful about their own salvation,
should need more than ten days, so as to be altogether free from the evil
custom of oaths. But if after ten days we be detected swearing, let us add a
penalty due to ourselves, and let us fix upon the greatest punishment and
condemnation of the transgression; what then is this condemnation? This I
do not fix upon, but will suffer you yourselves to determine the sentence.
So we arrange matters in our own case, not only in respect of oaths but in
respect of other defects, and fixing a time for ourselves, with most
grievous punishments, if at any time we have fallen into them, shall come
clean to our Master, and shall escape the fire of hell, and shall stand before
the judgment seat of Christ with boldness, to which may we all attain, by
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory
to the Father together with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever: Amen.

SECOND INSTRUCTION

To those about to be illuminated; and concerning women who adorn
themselves with plaiting of hair, and gold, and concerning those who have
used omens, and amulets, and incantations, all which are foreign to
Christianity.

1. I HAVE come to ask first of all for some fruit in return for the words
lately said out of brotherly love to you. For we do not speak in order that
ye should hear simply, but in order that ye should remember what has
been said, and may afford us evidence of this, by your works. Yea, rather,
not us, but, God, who knows the secrets of the heart. On this account
indeed instruction is so called, in order that even when we are absent, our
discourse may instruct your hearts. And be not surprised if, after an
interval of ten days only, we have come asking for fruit from the seed
sown. For in one day it is possible at once to let the seed fall, and to
accomplish the harvest. For strengthened not by our own power alone, but
by the influence which comes from God, we are summoned to the conflict.
Let as many therefore as have received what has been spoken, and have
fulfilled it by their works, remain reaching forth to the things which are
before. But let as many as have not yet arrived at this good achievement,
arrive at it straightway, that they may dispel the condemnation which
arises out of their sloth by their diligence for the future. For it is possible,
it is indeed possible for him who has been very slothful, by using diligence
for the future to recover the whole loss of the time that is past. Wherefore,
He says, "Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the
day of provocation." And this, He says, exhorting and counseling us; that
we should never despair, but so long as we are here, should have good
hopes, and should lay hold on what is before us, and hasten towards the
prize of our high calling of God. This then let us do, and let us inquire into
the names of this great gift. For as ignorance of the greatness of this
dignity makes those who are honored with it more slothful, so when it is
known it renders them thankful, and makes them more earnest; and
anyhow it would be disgraceful and ridiculous that they who enjoy such
glory and honors from God, should not even know what the names of it
are intended to show forth. And why do I speak about this gift, for if thou

wilt consider the common name of our race, thou wilt receive the greatest
instruction and incentive to virtue. For this name "Man," we do not define
according as they who are without define it, but as the Divine Scripture
has bidden us. For a man is not merely whosoever has hands and feet of a
man, nor whosoever is rational only, but whosoever practices piety and
virtue with boldness. Hear, at least, what he says concerning Job. For in
saying that "there was a man in the land of Ausis," he does not describe
him in those terms in which they who are without describe him, nor does
he say this because he had two feet and broad nails, but he added the
evidences of his piety and said, "just, true, fearing God, eschewing every
evil deed," showing that this is a man; even as therefore another says,
"Fear God, and keep his commandments, because this is the whole man."
But if the name man affords such a great incentive to virtue, much rather
the term faithful. For thou art called faithful on this account, because thou
hast faith in God, and thyself art entrusted from Him with righteousness,
sanctification, cleansing of soul, adoption, the kingdom of heaven. He
entrusted thee with these, and handed them over to thee. Thou in turn hast
entrusted, and handed over other things to him, almsgiving, prayers,
self-control and every other virtue. And why do I say almsgiving? If thou
givest him even a cup of cold water, thou shalt not indeed lose this, but
even this he keeps with care against that day, and will restore it with
overflowing abundance. For this truly is wonderful, that he does not keep
only that which has been entrusted to him, but in recompensing it
increases it.

This too he has bidden thee do according to thy power, with what has
been entrusted to thee, to extend the holiness which thou hast received,
and to make the righteousness which comes from the layer brighter, and
the gift of grace more radiant; even as therefore Paul did, increasing all the
good things which he received by his subsequent labors, and his zeal, and
his diligence. And look at the carefulness of God; neither did he give the
whole to thee then, nor withhold the whole, but gave part, and promised
part. And for what reason did he not give the whole then? In order that
thou mightest show thy faith about Him, believing, on his promise alone,
in what was not yet given. And for what reason again did he not there
dispense the whole, but did give the grace of the Spirit, and righteousness
and sanctification? In order that he might lighten thy labors for thee, and

by what has been already given may also put thee in good hope for that
which is to come. On this account, too, thou art about to be called
newly-enlightened, because thy light is ever new, if thou wilt, and is never
quenched. For this light of day, whether we will or no, the night succeeds,
but darkness knows not that light's ray. "For the light shineth in the
darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not." Not so bright at least is
the world, when the sunbeams come forth, as the soul shines and becomes
brighter when it has received grace from the Spirit and learns more exactly
the nature of the case. For when night prevails, and there is darkness, often
a man has seen a coil of rope and has thought it was a serpent, and has fled
from an approaching friend as from an enemy, and being aware of some
noise, has become very much alarmed; but when the day has come, nothing
of this sort could happen, but all appears just as it really is; which thing
also occurs in the case of our soul. For when grace has come, and driven
away the darkness of the understanding, we learn the exact nature of
things, and what was before dreadful to us becomes contemptible. For we
no longer fear death, after learning exactly, from this sacred initiation, that
death is not death, but a sleep and a seasonable slumber; nor poverty nor
disease, nor any other such thing, knowing that we are on our way to a
better life, undefiled and incorruptible, and free from all such vicissitudes.

2. Let us not therefore remain craving after the things of this life, neither
after the luxury of the table, or costliness of raiment. For thou hast the
most excellent of raiment, thou hast a spiritual; table thou hast the glory
from on high, and Christ is become to thee all things, thy table, thy
raiment, thy home, thy head, thy stem. "For as many of you as were
baptized into Christ, did put on Christ." See how he has become raiment
for thee. Dost thou wish to learn how he becomes a table for thee? "He
who eateth me," says He, "as I live because of the Father, he also shall live
because of me;" and that he becometh a home for thee, "he that eateth my
flesh abideth in me, and I in him; and that He is a stem He says again, "I
am the vine, ye the branches," and that he is brother, and friend, and
bridegroom, "I no longer call you servants: for ye are my friends;" and
Paul again, "I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a
pure virgin to Christ;" and again, "That he might be the first-born among
many brethren;" and we become not his brethren only, but also his
children, "For behold," he says, "I and the children which God has given

me" and not this only, but His members, and His body. For as if what has
been said were not enough to show forth the love and the good will which
He has shown forth towards us, He has added another thing greater and
nearer still, caring himself besides, our head. Knowing all these matters,
beloved, requite thy benefactor by the best conversation, and considering
the greatness of the sacrifice, adorn the members of thy body; consider
what thou receivest in thine hand, and never suffer it to strike any one, nor
shame what has been honored with so great a gift by the sin of a blow.
Consider what thou receivest in thine hand, and keep it clean from all
covetousness and extortion; think that thou dost not receive this in thy
hand, but also puttest it to thy mouth, and guard thy tongue in purity
from base and insolent words, blasphemy, perjury, and all other such
things. For it is disastrous that what is ministered to by such most dread
mysteries, and has been dyed red with such blood, and has become a
golden sword, should be perverted to purposes of raillery, and insult, and
buffoonery. Reverence the honor with which God has honored it, and
bring it not down to the vileness of sin, but having reflected again that after
the hand and the tongue, the heart receives this dread mystery, do not ever
weave a plot against thy neighbor, but keep thy thoughts pure from all
evil. Thus thou shall be able to keep thine eyes too, and thy hearing safe.
For is it not monstrous, after this mystic voice is born from heaven - I
mean the voice of the Cherubim - to defile thy hearing with lewd songs,,
and dissolute melodies? and does it not deserve the utmost punishment if,
with the same eyes with which thou lookest upon the unspeakable and
dread mysteries, thou lookest upon harlots, and dost commit adultery in
thy heart. Thou art called to a marriage, beloved: enter not in clad in sordid
raiment, but take a robe suitable to the marriage. For if when men are called
to a material marriage, though they be poorer than all others, they often
possess themselves of or buy clean raiment, and so go to meet those who
called them. Do thou too who hast been called to a spiritual marriage, and
to a royal banquet, consider what kind of raiment it would be right for thee
to buy, but rather there is not even need to purchase, yea he himself who
calls thee gives it thee gratis, in order that thou mayest not be able to plead
poverty in excuse. Keep, therefore, the raiment which thou receivedst. For
if thou losest it, thou wilt not be able to use it henceforth, or to buy it. For
this kind of raiment is nowhere sold. Hast thou heard how those who were
initiated, in old time, groaned, and beat their breasts, their conscience

thereupon exciting them? Beware then, beloved, that thou do not at any
time suffer like this. But how wilt thou not suffer, if thou dost not cast off
the wicked habit of evil men? For this reason I said before, and speak now
and will not cease speaking, if any has not rectified the defects in his
morals, nor furnished himself with easily acquired virtue, let him not be
baptized. For the laver is able to remit former sins, but there is no little
fear, and no ordinary danger lest we return to them, and our remedy
become a wound. For by how much greater the grace is, by so much is the
punishment more for those who sin after these things.

3. In order, therefore, that we return not to our former vomit, let us
henceforward discipline ourselves. For that we must repent beforehand,
and desist from our former evil, and so come forward for grace, hear what
John says, and what the leader of the apostles says to those who are about
to be baptized. For the one says, "Bring forth fruit worthy of repentance,
and begin not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our Father;"
and the other says again to those who question him, "Repent ye and be
baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Now he
who repents, no longer touches the same matters of which he repented. On
this account, also, we are bidden to say, "I renounce thee, Satan," in order
that we may never more return to him? As therefore happens in the case
of painters from life, so let it happen in your case. For they, arranging
their boards, and tracing white lines upon them, and sketching the royal
likeness in outline, before they apply the actual colors, rub out some lines,
and change some for others, rectifying mistakes, and altering what is amiss
with all freedom. But when they put on the coloring for good, it is no
longer in their power to rub out again, and to change one thing for another,
since they injure the beauty of the portrait, and the result becomes an
eyesore. Consider that thy soul is the portrait; before therefore the true
coloring of the spirit comes, wipe out habits which have wrongly been
implanted in thee, whether swearing, or falsehood, or insolence, or base
talking, or jesting, or whatever else thou hair a habit of doing of things
unlawful. Away with the habit, in order that thou mayest not return to it,
after baptism. The layer causes the sins to disappear. Correct thy habits,
so that when the colors are applied, and the royal likeness is brought out,
thou mayest no more wipe them out in the future; and add damage and
scars to the beauty which has been given thee by God. Restrain therefore

anger, extinguish passion. Be not thou vexed, be sympathizing, be not
exasperated, nor say, "I have been injured in regard to my soul." No one is
injured in regard to the soul if we do not injure ourselves in regard to the
soul; and how this is, I now say. Has any one taken away thy substance?
He has not injured thee in regard to thy soul, but thy money. But if thou
cherish ill-will against him, thou hast injured thyself in regard to thy soul.
For the money taken away has wrought thee no damage, nay has even
been profitable, but thou by not dismissing thine anger wilt give account in
the other world for this cherishing of ill-will. Has any one reviled thee and
insulted thee. He has in no way injured thy soul, and not even thy body.
Hast thou reviled in return and insulted? Thou hast injured thyself in
regard to thy soul, for the words which thou hast Said thou art about to
render account there; and this I wish you to know chiefly of all, that the
Christian, and faithful man, no one is able to injure in regard to the soul,
not even the devil himself; and not only is this wonderful, that God hath
made us inaccessible to all his designs, but that he has constituted us fit for
the practice of virtue, and there is no hindrance, if we will, even though we
be poor, weak in body, outcast, nameless, bondservants. For neither
poverty, nor infirmity, nor deformity of body, nor servitude, nor any
other of such things could ever become a hindrance to virtue; and why do I
say, poor, and a bondservant, and nameless? Even if thou art a prisoner,
not even this would be ever any hindrance to thee as regards virtue. And
how this is I proceed to say. Has any of thy household grieved thee and
provoked thee? dismiss thy wrath against him. Have bonds, and poverty,
and obscurity been any hindrance to thee in this respect? and why do I
say hindrance? They have both helped and contributed to restrain pride.
Hast thou seen another prospering? do not envy him. For not even in this
case is poverty a bar. Again, whenever thou needest to pray, do so with a
sober and watchful mind, and nothing shall be a bar even in that case.
Show all meekness, forbearance, self-restraint, gravity. For these things
need no external helps. And this especially is the chief point about virtue,
that it has no necessity for wealth, power, glory, nor anything of that
kind, but of a sanctified soul alone, and it seeks for nothing more. And
behold, also, the same thing happening in respect of grace. For if any one
be lame, if he has had his eyes put out, if he be maimed in body, if he has
fallen into the last extremity of weakness, grace is not hindered from
coming by any of these things. For it only seeks a soul receiving it with

readiness, and all these external things it passes over. For in the case of
worldly soldiers, those who are about to enlist them for the army seek for
stature of body and healthy condition, and it is not only necessary that he
who is about to become a soldier should have these alone, but he must also
be free. For if anybody be a slave, he is rejected. But the King of Heaven
seeks for nothing of this kind, but receives slaves into his army, and aged
people, and the languid in limb, and is not ashamed. What is more merciful
than this? What could be more kind? For he seeks for what is in our own
power, but they seek for what is not in our power. For to be a slave or
free is not our doing. To be tall, again, or short is not in our own power, or
to be aged, or well grown, and such like. But to be forbearing and kind, and
so forth, are matters of our own choice; and God demands of us only those
things of which we have control. And quite reasonably. For He does not
call Us to grace because of his own need, but because of doing us kindness;
but kings, because of services required by them; and they carry men off to
an outward and material warfare, but He to a spiritual combat; and it is not
only in the case of heathen wars, but in the case of the games also that one
may see the same analogy. For they who are about to be brought into the
theater, do not descend to the contest until the herald himself takes them
beneath the gaze of all, and leads them round, shouting out and saying,
"Has any one a charge against this person?" although in that case the
struggle is not concerned with the soul, but with the body. Wherefore then
dost thou demand proofs of nobleness? But in this case there is nothing of
the kind, but all is different, our contest not consisting of hand locked in
hand, but in philosophy of soul, and excellence of mind. The president of
our conflicts does the opposite. For he does not take us, and lead us round
and say, "Has any one a charge against this man?" but cries out, "Though
all men, though demons, stand up with the devil and accuse him of extreme
and unspeakable crimes, I reject him not, nor abhor him, but removing him
from his accusers, and freeing him from his wickedness, thus I bring him to
the contest. And this is very reasonable. For there indeed the president
contributes nothing towards the victory, in the case of the combatants, but
stands still in the midst. But here, the President of the contests for
holiness becomes a fellow-combatant, and helper, sharing with them the
conflict against the devil.

4. And not only is this the wonderful thing that he remits our sins, but
that he not even reveals them nor makes them manifest and patent, nor
compels us to come forward into the midst, and to tell out our errors, but
bids us make our defense to him alone, and to confess ourselves to him.
And yet among secular judges, if any tell any of the robbers or
grave-riflers, when they are arrested, to tell their errors and be quit of their
punishment, they would accede to this with all readiness, despising the
shame through desire of safety. But in this case there is nothing of this
kind, but he both remits the sins, nor compels us to marshal them in array
before any spectators. But one thing alone he seeks, that he who enjoys
this remission should learn the greatness of the gift. How is it not,
therefore, absurd that in case where he does us service, he should be
content with our testimony only, but in those where we serve him we seek
for others as witnesses, and do a thing for ostentation's sake? While we
wonder then at his kindliness, let us show forth our doings, and before all
others let us curb the vehemence of our tongue, and not always be giving
utterance. "For in the multitude of words there wanteth not
transgression." If indeed then thou hast anything useful to say, open thy
lips. But if there be nothing necessary for thee to say, be silent, for it is
better. Art thou a handicraftsman? as thou sittest at work, sing psalms.
Dost thou not wish to sing with thy mouth? do this in thine heart; a psalm
is a great companion. In this case thou shall undergo nothing serious, but
shalt be able to sit in thy workshop as in a monastery. For not
suitableness of place, but strictness of morals will afford us quiet. Paul, at
least, pursuing his trade in a workshop suffered no injury to his own
virtue. Do not thou therefore say, How can I, being a handicraftsman and a
poor man, be a philosopher? This is indeed the very reason why thou
mayest be a philosopher. For poverty is far more conducive to piety for
us than wealth, and work than idleness; since wealth is even a hindrance to
those who do not take heed. For when it is needful to dismiss anger, to
extinguish envy, to curb passion, to offer prayer, to exhibit forbearance
and meekness, kindliness and charity, when would poverty be a bar? For it
is not possible by spending money to accomplish these things, but by
exhibiting a fight disposition; almsgiving especially needs money, but even
it shines forth in greater degree through poverty. For she who spent the
two mites was poorer than all men, and yet surpassed all. Let us not then
consider wealth to be anything great, nor gold to be better than clay. For

the value of material things is not owing to their nature, but to our estimate
of them. For if any one would inquire carefully, iron is much more
necessary than gold. For the one contributes to no need of our life, but the
other has furnished us with the greater part of our needs, ministering to
countless arts; and why do I speak of a comparison between gold and
iron? For these stones are more necessary than precious stones. For of
those nothing serviceable could be made, but out of these, houses and
walls and cities are erected. But do thou show me what gain could be
derived from these pearls, rather what harm would not happen? For in
order that thou mayest wear one pearl drop, countless poor people are
pinched with hunger. What excuse wilt thou hit upon? what pardon?

Dost thou wish to adorn thy face? Do so not with pearls, but with
modesty, and dignity. So thy countenance will be more full of grace in the
eyes of thy husband. For the other kind of adorning is wont to plunge him
into a suspicion of jealousy, and into enmity, quarrelsomeness and strife,
for nothing is more annoying than a face which is suspected. But the
ornament of compassion and modesty casts out all evil suspicion, and will
draw thy partner to thee more strongly than any bond. For natural beauty
does not impart such comeliness to the face as does the disposition of him
who beholds it, and nothing is so wont to produce that disposition as
modesty and dignity; so that if any woman be comely, and her husband be
ill affected towards her, she appears to him the most worthless of all
women; and if she do not happen to be fair of face, but her husband be
well affected towards her, she appears more comely than all. For sentence
is given not according to the nature of what is beheld, but according to the
disposition of the beholders. Adorn thy face then with modesty, dignity,
pity, lovingkindness, charity, affection for thy husband, forbearance,
meekness, endurance of ill. These are the tints of virtue. By means of these
thou wilt attract angels not human beings to be thy lovers. By means of
these thou hast God to commend thee, and when God receives thee, he
will certainly win over thy husband for thee. For if the wisdom of a man
illuminates his countenance, much more does the virtue of a woman
illuminate her face; and if thou considerest this to be a great ornament, tell
me what will be the advantage of the pearls in that day? But why is it
necessary to speak of that day, since it is possible to show all this from
what happens now. When, then, they who thought fit to revile the

emperor were dragged to the judgment hall, and were in danger of extreme
measures being taken, then the mothers, and the wives, laying aside their
necklaces, and their golden ornaments, and pearls, and all adornment, and
golden raiment, wearing a simple and mean dress, and besprinkled with
ashes, prostrated themselves before the doors of the judgment hall and
thus won over the judges; and if in the case of these earthly courts of
justice, the golden ornaments, and the pearls, and the variegated dress
would have been a snare and a betrayal, but forbearance, and meekness,
and ashes, and tears, and mean garments persuaded the judge, much more
would this take place in the case of that impartial and dread tribunal. For
what reason wilt thou be able to state, what defense, when the Master
lays these pearls to thy charge, and brings the poor who have perished
with hunger into the midst? On this account Paul said, "not with braided
hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment." For therein would be a snare.
And if we were to enjoy them continually, yet we shall lay them aside
with death. But arising out of virtue there is all security, and no vicissitude
and changeableness, but here it makes us more secure, and also
accompanies us there. Dost thou wish to possess pearls, and never to lay
aside this wealth? Take off all ornament and place it in the hands of Christ
through the poor. He will keep all thy wealth for thee, when He shall raise
up thy body with much radiancy. Then He shall invest thee with better
wealth and greater ornament, since this present is mean and absurd.
Consider then whom thou wishest to please, and for whose sake thou
puttest on this ornament, not in order that the ropemaker and the
coppersmith and the huckster may admire. Then art thou not ashamed, nor
blushest thou when thou showest thyself to them? doing all on their
account whom thou dost not consider worthy of accosting.

How then wilt thou laugh this fancy to scorn? If thou wilt remember that
word, which thou sentest forth when thou wert initiated, I renounce thee,
Satan, and thy pomp, and thy service. For the frenzy about pearls is
pomp of Satan. For thou didst receive gold not in order that thou mightest
bind it on to thy body, but in order that thou mightest release and nourish
the poor. Say therefore constantly, I renounce thee, Satan. Nothing is more
safe than this word if we shall prove it by our deeds.

5. This I think it right that you who are about to be initiated should learn.
For this word is a covenant with the Master. And just as we, when we

buy slaves, first ask those who are being sold if they are willing to be our
servants: So also does Christ. When He is about to receive thee into
service, He first asks if thou wishest to leave that cruel and relentless
tyrant, and He receives covenants from thee. For his service is not forced
upon thee. And see the lovingkindness of God. For we, before we put
down the price, ask those who are being sold, and when we have learned
that they are willing, then we put down the price. But Christ not so, but
He even put down the price for us all; his precious blood. For, He says, ye
were bought with a price. Notwithstanding, not even then does He compel
those who are unwilling, to serve him; but except thou hast grace, He says,
and of thine own accord and will determinest to enroll thyself under my
rule, I do not compel, nor force thee. And we should not have chosen to
buy wicked slaves. But if we should at any time have so chosen, we buy
them with a perverted choice, and put down a corresponding price for
them. But Christ, buying ungrateful and lawless slaves, put down the price
of a servant of first quality, nay rather much more, and so much greater
that neither speech nor thought can set forth its greatness. For neither
giving heaven, nor earth, nor sea, but giving up that which is more valuable
than all these, his own blood, thus He bought us. And after all these
things, he does not require of us witnesses, or registration, but is content
with the single word, if thou sayest it from thy heart. "I renounce thee,
Satan, and thy pomp," has included all. Let us then say this, "I renounce
thee, Satan," as men who are about in that world at that day to have that
word demanded of them, and let us keep it in order that we may then
return this deposit safe. But Satan's pomps are theatres, and the circus,
and all sin, and observance of days, and incantations and omens.

"And what are omens?" says one. Often when going forth from his own
house he has seen a one-eyed or lame man, and has shunned him as an
omen. This is a pomp of Satan. For meeting the man does not make the
day turn out ill, but to live in sin. When thou goest forth, then, beware of
one thing - that sin does not meet thee. For this it is which trips us up.
And without this the devil will be able to do us no harm. What sayest
thou? Thou seest a man, and shunnest him as an omen, and dost not see
the snare of the devil, how he sets thee at war with him who has done thee
no wrong, how he makes thee the enemy of thy brother on no just pretext;
but God has bidden us love our enemies; but thou art turned away from

him who did thee no wrong, having nothing to charge him with, and dost
thou not consider how great is the absurdity, how great the shame, rather
how great is the danger? Can I speak of anything more absurd? I am
ashamed, indeed, and I blush: But for your salvation's sake, I am, I am
compelled to speak of it. If a virgin meet him he says the day becomes
unsuccessful; but if a harlot meet him, it is propitious, and profitable, and
full of much business; are you ashamed? and do you smite your foreheads,
and bend to the ground? But do not this on account of the words which I
have spoken, but of the deeds which have been done. See then, in this case,
how the devil hid his snare, in order that we might turn away from the
modest, but salute and be friendly to the unchaste. For since he has heard
Christ saying that "He who looketh on a woman to desire her, has already
committed adultery with her," and has seen many get the better of
unchastity, wishing by another wrong to cast them again into sin, by this
superstitious observance he gladly persuades them to pay attention to
whorish women.

And what is one to say about them who use charms and amulets, and
encircle their heads and feet with golden coins of Alexander of Macedon.
Are these our hopes, tell me, that after the cross and death of our Master,
we should place our hopes of salvation on an image of a Greek king? Dost
thou not know what great result the cross has achieved? It has abolished
death, has extinguished sin, has made Hades useless, has undone the power
of the devil, and is it not worth trusting for the health of the body? It has
raised up the whole world, and dost thou not take courage in it? And what
wouldest thou be worthy to suffer, tell me? Thou dost not only have
amulets always with thee, but incantations bringing drunken and
half-witted old women into thine house, and art thou not ashamed, and
dost thou not blush, after so great philosophy, to be terrified at such
things? and there is a graver thing than this error. For when we deliver
these exhortations, and lead them away, thinking that they defend
themselves, they say, that the woman is a Christian who makes these
incantations, and utters nothing else than the name of God. On this
account I especially hate and turn away from her, because she makes use
of the name of God, with a view to ribaldry. For even the demons uttered
the name of God, but still they were demons, and thus they used to say to
Christ, "We know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God," and

notwithstanding, he rebuked them, and drove them away. On this account,
then, I beseech you to cleanse yourselves from this error, and to keep hold
of this word as a staff; and just as without sandals, and cloak, no one of
you would choose to go down to the market-place, so without this word
never enter the market-place, but when thou art about to pass over the
threshold of the gateway, say this word first: I leave thy ranks, Satan, and
thy pomp, and thy service, and I join the ranks of Christ. And never go
forth without this word. This shall be a staff to thee, this thine armor, this
an impregnable fortress, and accompany this word with the sign of the
cross on thy forehead. For thus not only a man who meets you, but even
the devil himself, will be unable to hurt you at all, when he sees thee
everywhere appearing with these weapons; and discipline thyself by these
means henceforth, in order that when thou receivest the seal thou mayest
be a well-equipped soldier, and planting thy trophy against the devil, may
receive the crown of righteousness, which may it be the lot of us all to
obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with whom be glory to the Father and to the Holy Spirit for ever and ever
- Amen.

THREE HOMILIES
CONCERNING THE POWER OF DEMONS

INTRODUCTION BY REV. W. R. W. STEPHENS.

The three following Homilies are closely connected in subject, and the
opening sentence of the third clearly proves that it was delivered two days
after the second; but it is impossible to say whether that which is placed
first was really delivered before the other two. It must however have been
spoken at Antioch, since Chrysostom refers at the beginning of it to his
sermons "on the obscurity of prophecies" in which passages occur which
clearly imply that he was not then a Bishop. The second of the three
homilies here translated was delivered in the presence of a Bishop, as is
clearly indicated by the commencement, and as the third was as already
mentioned delivered two days after the second we may safely affirm that
they were all spoken at Antioch when Chrysostom was a presbyter there
under the Episcopate of Flavian.

They deal with errors against which Chrysostom throughout his life most
strenuously contended. In an age of great depravity there seem to have
been many who tried to excuse the weak resistance which they made to
evil, both in themselves, and in others, by maintaining that the world was
abandoned to the dominion of devils, or to the irresistible course of fate.
To counteract the disastrous effects of such philosophy, which
surrendered man to the current of his passions, it was necessary to insist
very boldly and resolutely on the essential freedom of the will, on moral
responsibility, and the duty of vigorous exertion in resisting temptation.
And Chrysostom did this to an extent which some thought carried him
perilously near the errors of the Pelagian heresy. No one however has
described in more forcible language the powerful hold of sin upon human
nature, and the insufficiency of man to shake it off without the assistance
of divine grace. What he does most earnestly combat, both in the following
homilies and very many others, is the doctrine that evil was an original
integral part of our nature: he maintains that it is not a substantial inherent
force (du>namiv ejnupo>statv). If evil was a part of our nature in this sense
it would be no more reprehensible than natural appetites and affections.
We do not try to alter that which is by nature (fu>sei) sin therefore is not

by nature, because by means of education, laws, and punishments we do
seek to alter that. Sin comes through defect in the moral purpose
(proai>resiv). Our first parents fell through indolence of moral purpose
(rJa|qumi>a) and this is the principal cause of sin now. They marked out a
path which has been trodden ever since: the force of will has been
weakened in all their posterity: so that though evil is not an inherent part
of man's nature yet he is readily inclined to it (ojxurjrJeph<s pro<v
kakia>n); and this tendency must be perpetually counteracted by vigorous
exertion, and a bracing up of the moral purpose, with the aid of divine
grace. Profoundly convinced therefore on the one hand of a strong and
universal tendency to sin, but on the other of an essential freedom of the
will, Chrysostom sounds alternately the note of warning and
encouragement, - warning against that weakness, indolence, languor of
moral purpose which occasions a fall, - encouragement to use to the full
all the powers with which man is gifted, in reliance on God's forbearance
and love, and on His willingness to help those who do not despair of
themselves. Despair is the devil's most potent instrument for effecting the
ruin of man; for it is that which prevents him from rising again after he has
fallen. St. Paul repented, and, not despairing, became equal to angels: Judas
repenting, but despairing, rushed into perdition.

ON THE POWER TO RESIST
THE DEVIL

TRANSLATED BY

RECTOR OF RUMBOLDWHYKE, CHICHESTER

HOMILY 1

AGAINST THOSE WHO SAY THAT DEMONS GOVERN HUMAN
AFFAIRS, AND WHO ARE DISPLEASED AT THE CHASTISEMENT
OF GOD, AND ARE OFFENDED AT THE PROSPERITY OF
THE WICKED AND THE HARDSHIPS OF THE JUST

I INDEED was hoping, that from the continuance of my discourse, you
would have had a surfeit of my words: but I see that the contrary is
happening: that no surfeit is taking place from this continuance, but that
your desire is increased, that an addition is made not to your satiety but to
your pleasure, that the same thing is happening which the winebibbers at
heathen drinking-bouts experience; for they, the more they pour down
unmixed wine, so much the rather they kindle their thirst, and in your case
the more teaching we inculcate, so much the rather do we kindle your
desire, we make your longing greater, your love for it the stronger. On this
account, although I am conscious of extreme poverty, I do not cease to
imitate the ostentatious among entertainers, both setting before you my
table continuously, and placing on it the cup of my teaching, filled full: for
I see that after having drunk it all, you retire again thirsting. And this
indeed has become evident during the whole time, but especially since the
last Lord's Day: For that ye partake of the divine oracles insatiably, that
day particularly shewed: whereon I discoursed about the unlawfulness of
speaking ill one of another, when I furnished you with a sure subject for
self accusation, suggesting that you should speak ill of your own sins, but
should not busy yourselves about those of other people: when I brought
forward the Saints as accusing themselves indeed, but sparing others: Paul
saying I am the chief of sinners, and that God had compassion on him who
was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious, and calling himself one
born out of due time, and not even thinking himself worthy of the title of
Apostle: Peter saying "Depart from me because I am a sinful man:"
Matthew styling himself a publican even in the days of his Apostleship:
David crying out and saying "My iniquities have gone over my head, and
as a heavy burden have been burdensome to me:" and Isaiah lamenting and
bewailing "I am unclean, and have unclean lips:" The three children in the
furnace of fire, confessing and saying that they have sinned and

transgressed, and have not kept the commandments of God. Daniel again
makes the same lamentation. When after the enumeration of these Saints, I
called their accusers flies, and introduced the right reason for the
comparison, saying, that just as they fasten themselves upon the wounds
of others, so also the accusers bite at other people's sins, collecting disease
therefrom for their acquaintance, and those who do the opposite, I
designated bees, not gathering together diseases, but building honeycombs
with the greatest devotion, and so flying to the meadow of the virtue of
the Saint: Then accordingly - then ye shewed your insatiable longing. For
when my discourse was extended to some length, yea to an interminable
length, such as never was, many indeed expected that your eagerness
would be quenched by the abundance of what was said. But the contrary
happened. For your heart was the rather warmed, your desire was the
rather kindled: and whence was this evident? The acclamations at least
which took place at the end were greater, and the shouts more clear, and
the same thing took place as at the forge. For as there at the beginning
indeed the light of the fire is not very clear, but when the flame has caught
the whole of the wood that is laid upon it, it is raised to a great height; so
also accordingly this happened on the occasion of that day. At the
beginning indeed, this assembly was not vehemently stirred by me. But
when the discourse was extended to some length, and gradually took hold
of all the subjects and the teaching spread more widely, then accordingly,
then the desire of listening was kindled in you, and the applause broke
forth, more vehemently. On this account, although I had been prepared to
say less than was spoken, I then exceeded the measure, nay rather I never
exceeded the measure. For I am wont to measure the amount of the
teaching not by the multitude of the words spoken, but by the disposition
of the audience. For he who meets with a disgusted audience, even if he
abridge his teaching, seems to be vexatious, but he who meets with eager,
and wide-awake, and attentive hearers, though he extend his discourse to
some length, not even thus fulfills their desire.

But since it happens that there are in so great a congregation, certain weak
ones, unable to follow the length of the discourse, I wish to suggest this to
them, that they should hear and receive, as much as they can, and having
received enough should retire: There is no one who forbids, or compels
them to remain beyond their natural strength. Let them not however

necessitate the abridgement of the discourse before the time and the proper
hours. Thou art replete, but thy brother still hungers. Thou art drunk with
the multitude of the things spoken, but thy brother is still thirsty. Let him
then not distress thy weakness, compelling thee to receive more than thine
own power allows: nor do thou vex his zeal by preventing him from
receiving all that he can take in.

2. This also happens at secular feasts. Some indeed are more quickly
satisfied, some more tardily, and neither do these blame those, nor do they
condemn these. But there indeed to withdraw more quickly is
praiseworthy, but here to withdraw more quickly is not praiseworthy, but
excusable. There to leave off more slowly, is culpable and faulty, here to
withdraw more tardily, brings the greatest commendation, and good report.
Pray why is this? Because there indeed the tardiness arises from
greediness, but here the endurance, and patience are made up of spiritual
desire and divine longing.

But enough of preamble. And we will proceed hereupon to that business
which remained over to us from that day. What then was that which was
then spoken? that all men had one speech, just as also they had one nature,
and no one was different in speech, or in tongue. Whence then comes so
great a distinction in speech? From the carelessness of those who received
the gift - of both of which matters we then spoke, shewing both the
lovingkindness of the Master through this unity of speech, and the
senselessness of the servants through their distinction of speech. For he
indeed foreseeing that we should waste the gift nevertheless gave it: and
they to whom it was entrusted, waxed evil over their charge This is then
one way of explanation, not that God wrested the gift from us but that we
wasted what had been given. Then next after that, that we received
afterwards gifts greater than those lost. In place of temporal toil he
honored us with eternal life. In place of thorns and thistles he prepared the
fruit of the Spirit to grow in our souls. Nothing was more insignificant
than man, and nothing became more honored than man. He was the last
item of the reasonable creation. But the feet became the head, and by
means of the first-fruits, were raised to the royal throne. For just as some
generous and opulent man who has seen some one escape from shipwreck
and only able to save his bare body from the waves, cradles him in his
hands, and casts about him a bright garment, and conducts him to the

highest honors; so also God has done in the case of our nature. Man cast
aside all that he had, his fight to speak freely, his communion with God,
his sojourn in Paradise, his unclouded life, and as from a shipwreck, went
forth bare. But God received him and straightway clothed him, and taking
him by the hand gradually conducted him to heaven. And yet the
shipwreck was quite unpardonable. For this tempest was due entirely not
to the force of the winds, but to the carelessness of the sailor.

And yet God did not look at this, but had compassion for the magnitude
of the calamity, and him who had suffered shipwreck in harbor, he
received as lovingly as if he had undergone this in the midst of the open
sea. For to fall in Paradise is to undergo shipwreck in harbor. Why so?
Because when no sadness, or care, or labors, or toil, or countless waves of
desire assaulted our nature, it was upset and it fell. And as the miscreants
who sail the sea, often bore through the ship with a small iron tool, and let
in the whole sea to the ship from below; so accordingly then, when the
Devil saw the ship of Adam, that is his soul, full of many good things, he
came and bored it through with his mere voice, as with some small iron
tool, and emptied him of all his wealth and sank the ship itself. But God
made the gain greater than the loss, and brought our nature to the royal
throne. Wherefore Paul cries out and says, "He raised us up with him, and
made us to sit with him, on his right hand in the heavenly places, that in
the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in
kindness towards us." What dost thou say? the thing has already
happened and has an end, and dost thou say "in order that he might shew
to the ages to come?" Has he not shewn? He has already shewn, but not to
all men, but to me who am faithful, but the unbelieving has not yet seen
the wonder. But then, in that day the whole nature of man will come
forward, and will wonder at that which has been done, but especially will
it be more manifest to us. For we believe even now; but hearing and sight
do not put a wonder before us in the same way, but just as in the case of
kings when we hear of the purple robe, and the diadem, and the golden
raiment, and the royal throne, we wonder indeed, but experience this in
greater degree when the curtains are drawn aside and we see him seated on
the lofty judgment seat. So also in the case of the Only-Begotten, when we
see the curtains of heaven drawn aside, and the King of angels descending
thence, and with his bodyguard of the heavenly hosts, then we perceive

the wonder to be greater from our sight of it. For consider with me what it
is to see our nature born upon the Cherubim, and the whole angelic force
surrounding it.

3. But look, with me, too, at the wisdom of Paul, how many expressions
he seeks for, so as to present to us the lovingkindness of God. For he did
not speak merely the word grace, nor riches, but what did he say? "The
exceeding riches of his grace in kindness." But notwithstanding even so, he
is below the mark; and even as the slippery bodies when grasped by
countless hands, escape our hold, and slip through easily; so also are we
unable to get hold of the lovingkindness of God in whatever expressions
we may try to grasp it, but the exceeding magnitude of it baffles the
feebleness of our utterances. And Paul there - fore experiencing this, and
seeing the force of words defeated by its magnitude, desists after saying
one word: and what is this? "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift."
For neither speech, nor any mind is able to set forth the tender care of
God. On this account he then says that it is past finding out, and
elsewhere "The peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep
your hearts."

But, as I was saying, these two ways of explanation are found in the
meantime: one indeed that God has not wrested the gift that we have lost;
and next, that the good things which have been given to us are even greater
than those which we have lost. And I wish also to mention a third too.
What then is the third? That even if he had not given the things after these,
which were greater than those we had lost, but had only taken away what
had been given to us, as we furnished the reason why, (for let this be
added); even this is enough of itself to shew his tender care towards us.
For not only to give, but also to take away what was given, is a mark of
the greatest loving-kindness, and, if you will, let us lay bare the matter, in
the case of Paradise. He gave Paradise. This of his own tender care. We
were seen to be unworthy of the gift. This of our own senselessness. He
took away the gift from those who became unworthy of it. This came of
his own goodness. And what kind of goodness is it, says one, to take
away the gift? Wait, and thou shalt fully hear. For think, what Cain would
have been, dwelling in Paradise after his bloodguiltiness. For if, when he
was expelled from that abode, if when condemned to toil and labor, and
beholding the threat of death hanging over his head, if seeing the calamity

of his father before his eyes, and holding the traces of the wrath of God
still in his hands, and encompassed with so great horrors, he lashed out
into such great wickedness, as to ignore nature, and to forget one born
from the same birth pangs, and to slay him who had done him no wrong,
to lay hold on his brother's person, and to dye his right hand with blood,
and when God wanted him to be still, to refuse submission and to affront
his maker, to dishonor his parents; if this man had continued to dwell in
Paradise - look, into how great evil he would have rushed. For if when so
many restraints were laid upon him, he leapt with fatal leaps; and if these
walls were set at nought, whither would he not have precipitated himself?

Wouldest thou learn too from the mother of this man, what a good result
the expulsion from the life of Paradise had, compare what Eve was before
this, and what she became afterwards. Before this indeed, she considered
that deceiving Devil, that wicked Demon to be more worth believing than
the commandments of God, and at the mere sight of the tree, she trampled
under foot the law which had been laid down by Him. But when the
expulsion from Paradise came, consider how much better and wiser she
grew. For when she bare a son, she says "I have gotten a man through the
Lord." She straightway flew to the master. who before this had despised
the master, and she neither ascribes the matter to nature, nor puts the birth
down to the laws of marriage, but she recognizes the Lord of Nature, and
acknowledges thanks to Him for the birth of the little child. And she who
before this deceived her husband, afterwards even trained the little child,
and gave him a name which of itself was able to bring the gift of God to her
remembrance: and again when she bare another, she says "God hath raised
up seed to me in place of Abel whom Cain slew." The woman remembers
her calamity, and does not become impatient but she gives thanks to God,
and calls the little child after his gift, furnishing it with constant material
for instruction. Thus even in his very deprivation God conferred greater
benefit. The woman suffered expulsion from Paradise, but by means of her
ejection she was led to a knowledge of God, so that she found a greater
thing than she lost. And if it were profitable, says one, to suffer expulsion
from Paradise, for what cause did God give Paradise at the beginning? This
turned out profitably to man, on account of our carelessness, since, if at
least, they had taken heed to themselves, and had acknowledged their
master, and had known how to be self-restrained, and to keep within

bounds, they would have remained in honor. But when they treated the
gifts which had been given them with insolence, then it became profitable,
that they should be ejected. For what cause then did God give at first? In
order that he might shew forth his own lovingkindness, and because He
himself was prepared to bring us even to greater honor. But we were the
cause of chastisement and punishment on all sides, ejecting ourselves
through our indifference to goods which were given to us. Just as therefore
an affectionate father, at first indeed, suffers his own son to dwell in his
home, and to enjoy all his father's goods, but when he sees that he has
become worthless of the honor, he leads him away from his table, and puts
him far from his own sight, and often casts him forth from his paternal
home, in order that he, suffering expulsion, and becoming better by this
slight and this dishonor, may again shew himself worthy of restoration,
and may succeed to his father's inheritance: So has God done. He gave
Paradise to man. He cast him out when he appeared unworthy, in order
that by his dwelling outside, and through his dishonor, he might become
better, and more self-restrained, and might appear worthy again of
restoration. Since after those things he did become better, he brings him
back again and says "Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise." Dost thou
see that not the gift of Paradise but even the ejection from Paradise was a
token of the greatest tender care? For had he not suffered expulsion from
Paradise, he would not again have appeared worthy of Paradise.

4. This argument therefore let us maintain throughout, and let us apply it
to the case of the subject lying before us. God gave a speech common to
all. This is part of his loving kindness to men. They did not use the gift
rightly, but they lapsed to utter folly. He took away again that which had
been given. For if when they had one speech, they fell into so great folly,
as to wish to build a tower to heaven: had they not immediately been
chastised would they not have desired to lay hold on the height of heaven
itself? For why? If indeed that were impossible for them, yet
notwithstanding their impious thoughts are made out from their plan. All
which things God foresaw, and since they did not use their oneness of
speech rightly, he rightly divided them by difference of speech. And see
with me, his lovingkindness. "Behold," saith he "they all have one speech,
and this they have begun to do."

For what reason did he not at once proceed to the division of tongues, but
first of all defend himself, as if about to be judged in a lawcourt? And yet
at least no one can say to him why hast thou thus done? yea he is at
liberty to do all things as he wills. But still as one about to give account, he
thus sets up a defense, teaching us to be gentle and loving. For if the
master defends himself to his servants, even when they have done him this
wrong; much more ought we to defend ourselves to one another, even if we
are wronged to the highest degree. See at least how he defends himself.
"Behold they have all one mouth and one speech" saith he, "and this they
have begun to do," as if he said let no one accuse me of this when he sees
the division of tongues. Let no one consider that this difference of speech
was made over to men from the beginning. "Behold they all have one
mouth, and one speech." But they did not use the gift aright. And in order
that thou mayest understand that he does not chastise for what has taken
place so much as he provides for improvement in the future, hear the
sequel "and now none of all the things will fail them, which they set on
foot to do." Now what he says, is of such a kind as this. If they do not
pay the penalty now, and be restrained from the very root of their sins,
they will never cease from wickedness. For this is what "none of the
things will fail them which they set on foot to do means, as if he said, and
they will add other deeds yet more monstrous. For such a thing is
wickedness; if when it has taken a start it be not hindered, as fire catching
wood, so it rises to an unspeakable height. Dost thou see that the
deprivation of oneness of speech was a work of much lovingkindness? He
inflicted difference of speech upon them, in order that they might not fall
into greater wickedness. Hold fast this argument then with me, and let it
ever be fixed and immovable in your minds, that not only when he confers
benefits but even when he chastises God is good and loving. For even his
chastisements and his punishments are the greatest part of his beneficence,
the greatest form of his providence. Whenever therefore thou seest that
famines have taken place, and pestilences, and drought and immoderate
rains, and irregularities in the atmosphere, or any other of the things which
chasten human nature, be not distressed, nor be despondent, but worship
Him who caused them, marvel at Him for His tender care. For He who
does these things is such that He even chastens the body that the soul may
become sound. Then does God these things saith one? God does these
things, and even if the whole city, nay even if the whole universe were

here I will not shrink from saying this. Would that my voice were clearer
than a trumpet, and that it were possible to stand in a lofty place, and to
cry aloud to all men, and to testify that God does these things. I do not
say these things in arrogance but I have the prophet standing at my side,
crying and saying, "There is no evil in the city which the Lord hath not
done" - now evil is an ambiguous term; and I wish that you shall learn
the exact meaning of each expression, in order that on account of ambiguity
you may not confound the nature of the things, and fall into blasphemy.

5. There is then evil, which is really evil; fornication, adultery,
covetousness, and the countless dreadful things, which are worthy of the
utmost reproach and punishment. Again there is evil, which rather is not
evil, but is called so, famine, pestilence, death, disease, and others of a like
kind. For these would not be evils. On this account I said they are called
so only. Why then? Because, were they evils, they would not have
become the sources of good to us, chastening our pride, goading our sloth,
and leading us on to zeal, making us more attentive. "For when," saith one,
"he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned, and came early to
God." He calls this evil therefore which chastens them, which makes them
purer, which renders them more zealous, which leads them on to love of
wisdom; not that which comes under suspicion and is worthy of reproach;
for that is not a work of God, but an invention of our own will, but this is
for the destruction of the other. He calls then by the name of evil the
affliction, which arises from our punishment; thus naming it not in regard
to its own nature, but according to that view which men take of it. For
since we are accustomed to call by the name of evil, not only thefts and
adulteries, but also calamities; so he has called the matter, according to the
estimate of mankind. This then is that which the prophet saith "There is
no evil in the city which the Lord hath not done." This too by means of
Isaiah God has made clear saying "I am God who maketh peace and
createth evil," again naming calamities evils. This evil also Christ hints at,
thus saying to the disciples, "sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,"
that is to say the affliction, the misery. It is manifest then on all sides, that
he here calls punishment evil; and himself brings these upon us, affording
us the greatest view of his providence. For the physician is not only to be
commended when he leads forth the patient into gardens and meadows,
nor even into baths and pools of water, nor yet when he sets before him a

well furnished table, but when he orders him to remain without food, when
he oppresses him with hunger and lays him low with thirst, confines him
to his bed, both making his house a prison, and depriving him of the very
light, and shadowing his room on all sides with curtains, and when he cuts,
and when he cauterizes, and when he brings his bitter medicines, he is
equally a physician. How is it not then preposterous to call him a
physician who does so many evil things, but to blaspheme God, if at any
time He doeth one of these things, if He bring on either famine or death,
and to reject his providence over all? And yet He is the only true
physician both of souls and bodies. On this account He often seizes this
nature of ours wantoning in prosperity, and travailing with a fever of sins,
and by want, and hunger, and death and other calamities and the rest of the
medicines of which He knows, frees us from diseases. But the poor alone
feel hunger, says one. But He does not chasten with hunger alone, but with
countless other things. Him who is in poverty He has often corrected with
hunger, but the rich and him who enjoys prosperity, with dangers,
diseases, untimely deaths. For He is full of resources, and the medicines
which He has for our salvation are manifold.

Thus too the judges do. They do not honor, or crown those only who
dwell in cities, nor do they provide gifts alone, but they also often correct.
On this account both the sword is sharpened by them, and tortures are
prepared; both the wheel and the stocks, and the executioners, and
countless other forms of chastisement. That which the executioner is to
the judges, famine is to God - as an executioner correcting us and leading
us away from vice. This too, it is possible to see in the case of the
husbandmen: They do not then, only protect the root of the vine, nor
hedge it round but prune it, and lop off many of the branches; on this
account not only have they a hoe, but a sickle too, suitable for cutting: yet
notwithstanding we do not find fault with them, but then above all we
admire them, when we see them cutting off much that is unserviceable, so
as through the rejection of what is superfluous to afford great security to
that which remains. How is it not then preposterous, that we should thus
approve of a father indeed and a physician and a judge, and a husbandman,
and should neither blame nor censure him who casts his son out of his
house nor the physician who puts his patient to torture nor the judge who
corrects, nor the husbandman who prunes: but that we should blame and

smite with countless accusations God, if he would at any time raise us up,
when we are as it were, besotted through the great drunkenness which
comes of wickedness? How great madness would it not be, not even to
allow God a share of the same self-justification, of which we allow our
fellow servants a share?

6. Fearing these things for them who reproach God, I speak now, in order
that they may not kick against the pricks, and cover their own feet with
blood, that they may not throw stones to heaven; and receive wounds on
their own head. But I have somewhat else far beyond this to say. For
omitting to ask (I say this by way of concession) if God took from us to
our profit, I only say this; that if He took what had been given, not even
thus, could anyone be able to reproach Him. For He was Lord of his own.
Among men indeed, when they entrust us with money, and lend us silver,
we give them our thanks for the time during which they lent it, we are not
indignant at the time at which they take back their own. And shall we
reproach God who wishes to take back his own? Indeed now is this not
the extreme of folly? yea the great and noble Job did not act thus. For not
only when he received, but even when he was deprived, he gives the
greatest thanks to God saying." The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away;
may the name of the Lord be blessed for ever." But if it is right to give
thanks for both these even separately, and deprivation is not the less
serviceable than bestowal; what excusableness should we have, tell me, in
recompensing in a contrary spirit, and being impatient with Him when we
ought to worship, who is so gentle, and loving and careful, who is wiser
than every Physician, and more full of affection than any father, juster
than any judge, and more anxious than any husbandman, in healing these
souls of ours? What then could be more insane and senseless than they
who in the midst of so great good order, say that we are deprived of the
providence of God? For just as if some one were to contend that the soul
was murky and cold, he would produce an example of extreme insanity, by
his opinion; so if any one doubts about the providence of God, much
rather is he liable to charges of madness.

Not so manifest is the Sun, as the providence of God is clear. But
nevertheless some dare to say that Demons administer our affairs. What
can I do? Thou hast a loving Master. He chooses rather to be blasphemed
by thee through these words, than to commit thine affairs to the Demons

and persuade thee by the reality how Demons administer. For then thou
wouldest know their wickedness well by the experience of it. But rather
indeed now it is possible to set it before you as it were by a certain small
example. Certain men possessed of Demons coming forth out of the tombs
met Christ, and the Demons kept beseeching him to suffer them to enter
the herd of swine. And he suffered them, and they went away, and
straightway precipitated them all headlong. Thus do Demons govern; and
yet to them the swine were of no particular account, but with thee there is
ever a warfare without a truce, and an implacable fight, and undying
hatred. And if in the case of those with whom they had nothing in
common they did not even endure that they should be allowed a brief
breathing space of time: if they had gotten unto their power us their
enemies who are perpetually stinging them what would they not have
done? and what incurable mischief would they not have accomplished? For
this reason God let them fall upon the herd of swine, in order that in the
case of the bodies of irrational animals thou mayest learn their wickedness,
and that they would have done to the possessed the things which they did
to the swine, had not the demoniacs in their very madness experienced the
providence of God, is evident to all: and now therefore when thou seest a
man excited by a Demon, worship the Master. Learn the wickedness of
the Demons. For it is possible to see both things in the case of these
Demons, the lovingkindness of God, and the evil of the Demons. The evil
of the Demons when they harass and disturb the soul of the demented: and
the lovingkindness of God whenever he restrains and hinders so savage a
Demon, who has taken up his abode within, and desires to hurl the man
headlong, and does not allow him to use his own power to the full, but
suffers him to exhibit just so much strength, as both to bring the man to
his senses, and make his own wickedness apparent. Dost thou wish to
form another example to see once more how a Demon arranges matters
when God allows him to use his own power? Consider the herds, the
flocks of Job, how in one instant of time he annihilated all, consider the
pitiable death of the children, the blow that was dealt to his body: and
thou shalt see the savage and inhuman and unsparing character of the
wickedness of the Demons, and from these things thou shall know clearly
that if God had. entrusted the whole of this world to their authority, they
would have confused and disturbed everything, and would have assigned
to us their treatment of the swine, and of those herds, since not even for a

little breathing space of time could they have endured to spare us our
salvation. If Demons were to arrange affairs, we should be in no better
condition than possessed men, yea rather we should be worse than they.
For God did not give them over entirely to the tyranny of the Demons,
otherwise they would suffer far worse things than these which they now
suffer. And I would ask this of those who say these things, what kind of
disorder they behold in the present, that they set down all our affairs to
the arrangement of Demons? And yet we behold the sun for so many
years proceeding day by day in regular order, a manifold band of stars
keeping their own order, the courses of the moon unimpeded, an invariable
succession of night and day, all things, both above and below, as it were in
a certain fitting harmony, yea rather even far more, and more accurately
each keeping his own place, and not departing from the order which God
who made them ordained from the beginning.

7. And what is the use of all this, says one, when the heaven indeed, and
sun, and moon, and the band of stars, and all the rest keep much good
order, but our affairs are full of confusion and disorder. What kind of
confusion, O man, and disorder? A certain one, says he, is rich, and
overbearing, He is rapacious and covetous, he drains the substance of the
poor day by day, and suffers no terrible affliction. Another lives in
forbearance, self-restraint, and uprightness, and is adorned with all other
good qualities, and is chastened with poverty and disease, and extremely
terrible afflictions. Are these then the matters which offend thee? Yes,
these, says he. If then thou seest both of the rapacious, many chastened,
and of those living virtuously, yea some even enjoying countless goods,
why dost thou not abandon thine opinion, and be content with the
Almighty? Because it is this very thing which offends me more. For why
when there are two evil men, is one chastened, and another gets off, and
escapes; and when there are two good men, one is honored, and the other
continues under punishment? And this very thing is a very great work of
God's providence. For if he were to chasten all the evil men, here; and
were to honor here all the good men, a day of judgment were superfluous.
Again if he were to chasten no wicked man, nor were to honor any of the
good, then the base would become baser and worse, as being more careless
than the excellent, and they who were minded to blaspheme would accuse
God all the more, and say that our affairs were altogether deprived of his

providence. For if when certain evil men are chastened, and certain good
men punished, they likewise say that human affairs are subject to no
providence; if even this did not happen what would they not say? and
what words would they not send forth? On this account some of the
wicked he chastens, and some he does not chasten and some of the good he
honors and some he does not honor. He does not chasten all, in order that
he may persuade thee, that there is a Resurrection. But he chastens some
in order that he may make the more careless, through fear by means of the
punishment of the others, more in earnest. Again he honors certain of the
good, in order that he may lead on others by his honors to emulate their
virtue. But he does not honor all, in order that thou mayest learn that there
is another season for rendering to all their recompense. For if indeed all
were to receive their deserts here, they would disbelieve the account of the
Resurrection. But if no one were to receive his desert here, the majority
would become more careless. On this account some he chastens, and
others he does not chasten, profiling both those who are chastened, and
those who are not chastened. For he separates their wickedness from
those, and he makes the others by their punishment, more self-restrained.
And this is manifest from what Christ himself said. For when they
announced to him that a tower had been brought to the ground, and had
buried certain men, he saith to them "What think ye? that these men were
sinners only? I say to you nay, but if ye do not repent ye also shall suffer
the same thing."

Dost thou see how those perished on account of their sin, and the rest did
not escape on account of their righteousness, but in order that they might
become better by the punishment of the others? Were not then the
chastened unjustly dealt with says one? For they could without being
chastened themselves become better by the punishment of others. But if
He had known that they would become better from penitence God would
not have chastened them. For if when he foresaw that many would profit
nothing from his longsuffering, he nevertheless bears with them, with
much tolerance, fulfilling his own part, and affording them an opportunity
of coming out of their own senselessness to their sober senses one day;
how could he deprive those who were about to become better from the
punishment of others, of the benefit of repentance? So that they are in no
way unjustly treated, both their evil being cut off by their punishment,

and their chastening is to be lighter there, because they suffered here
beforehand. Again, they who were not chastened are in no way unjustly
treated; for it was possible for them, had they wished, to have used the
longsuffering of God, to accomplish a most excellent change, and
wondering at his tolerance, to have become ashamed at his exceeding
forbearance, and one day to have gone over to virtue, and to have gained
their own salvation by the punishment of others. But if they remain in
wickedness, God is not to blame, who on this account was longsuffering,
that he might recover them, but they are unworthy of pardon, who did not
rightly use the longsuffering of God: and it is not only possible to use this
argument as a reason why all the wicked are not chastened here, but
another also not less than this. Of what kind then is this? That if God
brought upon all, the chastenings which their sins deserved, our race would
have been carried off, and would have failed to come down to posterity.
And in order that thou mayest learn that this is true, hear the prophet
saying "If Thou observedst iniquity O Lord, who shall stand?" And if it
seems good to thee to investigate this saying, leaving the accurate enquiry
into the life of each, alone: (For it is not possible even to know all that has
been accomplished by each man) let us bring forward those sins which all,
without contradiction, commit: and from these it will be plain and manifest
to us, that if we were chastened for each of our sins, we should long ago
have perished. He who has called his brother fool, "is liable to the hell of
fire" saith Heft Is there then any one of us who has never sinned this sin?
What then? ought he to be straightway carried off? Therefore we should
have been all carried off and would have disappeared, long ago, indeed very
long ago. Again he who swears, saith he, even if he fulfill his oath, doeth
the works of the wicked one. Who is there then, who has not sworn? Yea
rather who is there who has never sworn falsely? He who looketh on a
woman, saith he, with unchaste eyes, is wholly an adulterer, and of this
sin any one would find many guilty. When then these acknowledged sins
are such and so insufferable, and each of these of itself brings upon us
inevitable chastisement, if we were to reckon up the secret sins committed
by us, then we shall see especially that the providence of God does not
bring upon us punishment for each sin. So that when thou seest anyone
rapacious, covetous, and not chastened, then do thou unfold thine own
conscience; reckon up thine own life, go over the sins which have been
committed and thou shalt learn rightly that in thine own case first, it is not

expedient to be chastened for each of thy sins: for on this account the
majority make reckless utterances, since they do not look on their own
case before that of others, but we all leaving our own alone, examine that
of the rest. But let us no longer do this, but the reverse, and if thou seest
any righteous man chastened, remember Job: for if any one be righteous,
he will not be more righteous than that man, nor within a small distance of
approaching him. And if he suffer countless ills, he has not yet suffered so
much, as that man.

8. Taking this then into thy mind, cease charging the master; learning that
it is not by way of deserting him does God let such an one suffer ill, but
through desire to crown him, and make him more distinguished. And if
thou seest a sinner punished, remember the paralytic who passed thirty
eight years on his bed. For that that man was delivered over then to that
disease through sin, hear Christ saying "Behold thou art made whole; sin
no more lest a worse thing happen to thee." For either when we are
chastened, we pay the penalty of our sins, or else we receive the occasion
of crowning if, when we live in rectitude, we suffer ill. So that whether we
live in righteousness, or in sins, chastening is a useful thing for us,
sometimes making us more distinguished, sometimes rendering us more
self-controlled, and lightening our punishment to come for us. For that it is
possible that one chastened here, and bearing it thankfully should
experience milder punishment there hear St. Paul saying "For this reason
many are weak and sickly, and some sleep. For if we judged ourselves, we
should not be judged. But when we are judged we are corrected by the
Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world." Knowing all
these things therefore, Let us both moralize in this way on the providence
of God, and stop the mouths of the gainsayers. And if any of the events
which happen pass our understanding, let us not from this consider that
our affairs are not governed by providence, but perceiving His providence
in part, in things incomprehensible let us yield to the unsearchableness of
His wisdom. For if it is not possible for one not conversant with it to
understand a man's art, much rather is it impossible for the human
understanding to comprehend the infinity of the providence of God. "For
his judgments are unsearchable and his ways past finding out" But
nevertheless from small portions we gain a clear and manifest faith about
the whole, we give thanks to him for all that happens. For there is even

another consideration that cannot be contradicted, for those who wish to
moralize about the providence of God For we would ask the gainsayers, is
there then a God? and if they should say there is not, let us not answer
them. For just as it is worthless to answer madmen, so too those who say
there is no God. For if a ship having few sailors, and passengers, would
not be conducted safely for one mile even, without the hand which guides
it, much more, such a world as this, having so many persons in it,
composed of different elements, would not have continued so long a time,
were there not a certain providence presiding over it, both governing, and
continually maintaining this whole fabric, and if in shame, through the
common opinion of all men, and the experience of affairs, they confess
that there is a God, let us say this to them. If there is a God, as indeed
there is, it follows that He is just, for if He is not just neither is He God,
and if He is just He recompenses to each according to their desert. But we
do not see all here receiving according to their desert. Therefore it is
necessary to hope for some other requital awaiting us, in order that by
each one receiving according to his desert, the justice of God may be made
manifest. For this consideration does not only contribute to our wisdom
about providence alone, but about the Resurrection; and let us teach
others, and let us do all diligence to shut the mouths of them who rave
against the master, and let us ourselves glorify him in all things. For thus
shall we win more of his care, and enjoy much of his influence, and thus
shall we be able to escape from real evil, and obtain future good, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, By whom and with
whom be glory to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, now and always, for
ever and ever. Amen.

AGAINST THOSE WHO OBJECT BECAUSE THE DEVIL
HAS NOT BEEN PUT OUT OF THE WORLD: AND
TO PROVE THAT HIS WICKEDNESS DOES NO HARM TO US -
IF WE TAKE HEED: AND CONCERNING REPENTANCE

1. WHEN Isaac, in old time, was desirous to eat a meal at the hands of his
son, he sent his son forth from the house to the chace. But when this Isaac
was desirous to accept a meal at my hands he did not send me forth from
the house, but himself ran to our table. What could be more tenderly
affectionate than he? What more humble? who thought fit to shew his
warm love thus, and deigned to descend so far. On this account surely, we
also having spent the tones of our voice, and the strength of our feet over
the morning discourse, when we saw his fatherly face, forgot our
weakness, lay aside our fatigue, were uplifted with pleasure; we saw his
illustrious hoary head, and our soul was filled with light. On this account
too, we set out our table with readiness, in order that he should eat and
bless us. There is no fraud and guile, here, as there was then, there. One
indeed was commanded to bring the meal - but another brought it. But I
was commanded to bring it, and brought it too. Bless me then, O my
father, with spiritual blessing, which we all also pray ever to receive, and
which is profitable not only to thee, but also to me, and to all these.
Entreat the common master of us all, to prolong thy life to the old age of
Isaac. For this is both for me, and for these, more valuable, and more
needful than the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth.

But it is time to proceed to set out our table; what then is this? The
remains of what was lately said with a view to our love of you. For still -
still - we renew our discourse concerning the Devil, which we started
two days ago, which we also addressed to the initiated, this morning when
we discoursed to them about renunciation, and covenant. And we do this,
not because our discourse about the Devil is sweet to us, but because the
doctrine about him is full of security for you. For he is an enemy and a
foe, and it is a great security to know clearly, the tactics of your enemies.
We have said lately, that he does not overcome by force, nor by tyranny,

nor through compulsion, nor through violence. Since were this so, he
would have destroyed all men. And in testimony of this we brought
forward the swine, against which the Demons were unable to venture
anything, before the permission of the Master. The herds and flocks of
Job. For not even did the Devil venture to destroy these, until he received
power from above. We learned therefore this one thing first, that he does
not overcome us by force, or by compulsion; next after that, we added that
even when he overcomes by deceitfulness, not thus does he get the better
of all men, Then again we brought that athlete Job, himself into the midst,
against whom he set countless schemes going, and not even thus got the
better of him, but withdrew defeated. One question still remains. What
then is this matter? That if he does not overcome says one, by force, yet
by deceitfulness. And on this account it were better that he should be
destroyed. For if Job got the better of him, yet Adam was deceived and
overthrown. Now if once for all he had been removed from the world,
Adam would never have been overthrown. But now he remains, and is
defeated indeed by one, but gets the better of many. Ten overcame him,
but he himself overcomes and wrestles down ten thousand and if God took
him away from the world, these ten thousand would not have perished.
What then shall we say to this? That first of all they who overcame are
more valuable far than they who are defeated, even if the latter be more,
and the former less. "For better is one," saith he "that doeth the will of
God than ten thousand transgressors." And next, that if the antagonist
were taken away he who overcomes is thereby injured. For if thou lettest
the adversary remain, the more slothful are injured, not on account of the
more diligent, but by their own slothfulness; whereas it thou takest away
the antagonist, the more diligent are betrayed on account of the slothful,
and neither exhibit their own power, nor win crowns.

2. Perhaps ye have not yet understood what has been said. Therefore it is
necessary that I should say it again more clearly. Let there be one
antagonist. But let there be also two athletes about to wrestle gainst him,
and of these two athletes let one be consumed with gluttony, unprepared,
void of strength, nerveless; but the other diligent, of good habit, passing
his time in the wrestling school, in many gymnastic exercises, and
exhibiting all the practice which bears upon the contest. If then thou takest
away the antagonist, which of these two hast thou injured? The slothful,

pray, and unprepared, or the earnest one who has toiled so much? It is
quite dear that it is the earnest one: For the one indeed is wronged by the
slothful, after the antagonist has been taken away. But the slothful, while
he remains, is no longer injured on account of the earnest. For he has fallen,
owing to his own slothfulness.

I will state another solution of this question, in order that thou mayest
learn, that the Devil does not injure, but their own slothfulness
everywhere overthrows those who do not take heed. Let the Devil be
allowed to be exceeding wicked, not by nature, but by choice and
conviction. For that the Devil is not by nature wicked, learn from his very
names. For the Devil, the slanderer that is, is called so from slandering; for
he slandered man to God saying "Doth Job reverence thee for nought? but
put out thine hand, and touch what he hath, see if he will not blaspheme
thee to thy face." He slandered God again to man saying "Fire fell from
heaven and burnt up the sheep." For he was anxious to persuade him, that
this warfare was stirred up from above, out of the heavens, and he set the
servant at variance with the master, and the master with his servant; rather
he did not set them at variance, but attempted to indeed, but was not able,
in order that whenever thou mayest set another servant at variance with
his master, Adam with God, and believing the Devil's slander, thou
mayest learn that he gained strength, not owing to his own power but from
that man's slothfulness and carelessness. He is called the Devil therefore
on that account. But to slander, and to refrain from slander is not natural,
but an action which takes place and which ceases to take place, occurring
and ceasing to occur. Now such things do not reach the rank of the nature
or of the essence of a thing. I know that this consideration about essence
and accident is hard to be grasped by many. But there are they who are
able to lend a finer ear, wherefore also we have spoken these things. Do
you wish that I should come to another name? You shall see that that also
is not a name which belongs to his essence or nature. He is called wicked.
But his wickedness is not from his nature, but from his choice. For even
this at one time is present, at another time is absent. Do not thou then say
this to me that it always remains with him. For it was not indeed with him
at the beginning, but afterwards came upon him; wherefore he is called
apostate. Although many men are wicked, he alone is called wicked by
pre-eminence. Why then is he thus called? Because though in no way

wronged by us, having no grudge whether small or great, when he saw
mankind had in honor, he straightway envied him his good. What therefore
could be worse than this wickedness, except when hatred and war exist,
without having any reasonable cause. Let the Devil then be let alone, and
let us bring forward the creation, in order that thou mayest learn that the
Devil is not the cause of ills to us, if we would only, take heed: in order
that thou mayest learn that the weak in choice, and the unprepared, and
slothful, even were there no Devil, falls, and casts himself into many a
depth of evil. The Devil is evil. I know it myself and it is acknowedged by
all, yet give heed strictly to the things which are now about to be said. For
they are not ordinary matters, but those about which many words, many
times, and in many places arise, about which there is many a fight and
battle not only on the part of the faithful against unbelievers but also on
the part of the faithful against the faithful. For this is that which is full of
pain.

3. The Devil then is acknowledged, as I said, to be evil by all. What shall
we say about this beautiful and wondrous creation? Pray is the creation
too, wicked? and who is so corrupt, who so drill, and demented as to
accuse the creation? what then shall we say about this? For it is not
wicked, but is both beautiful and token of the wisdom and power and
lovingkindness of God. Hear at least how the prophet marvels at it,
saying, "How are thy works magnified O Lord! in wisdom Thou hast
made them all." He did go through them one by one, but withdrew before
the incomprehensible wisdom of God. And that he has made it thus
beautiful and vast hear a certain one saying, "From the vastness and
beauty of the creatures, the originator of them is proportionably seen."
Hear too Paul saying, "For the invisible things of Him, since the creation
of the world, are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are
made." For each of these by which he spake declared that the creation
leads us to the knowledge of God, because it causes us to know the
Master fully. What then? If we see this beautiful and wondrous creation
itself becoming a cause of impiety to many, shall we blame it? In no wise,
but them who were unable to use the medicine rightly. Whence then is this
which leads us to the knowledge of God, a cause of impiety? "The wise"
saith he "were darkened in their understandings, and worshipped and
served the creature more than the creator" The Devil is nowhere here, a

Demon is nowhere here, but the creation alone is set before us, as the
teacher of the knowledge of God. How then has it become the cause of
impiety? Not owing to its own nature, but owing to the carelessness of
those who do not take heed. What then? Shall we take away even the
creation? tell me.

And why do I speak about the creation? Let us come to our own members.
For even these we shall find to be a cause of destruction if we do not take
heed, not because of their own nature, but because of our sloth. And look;
an eye was given, in order that thou mayest behold the creation and glorify
the Master. But if thou dost not use the eye well, it becomes to thee the
minister of adultery. A tongue has been given, in order that thou mayest
speak well, in order that thou mayest praise the Creator. But if thou givest
not excellent heed, it becomes a cause of blasphemy to thee. And hands
were given thee that thou mayest stretch them forth unto prayer. But if
thou are not wary, thou stretchest them out unto covetousness. Feet were
given in order that thou mayest run unto good works, but if thou art
careless thou wilt cause wicked works by means of them: Dost thou see
that all things hurt the weak man? Dost thou see that even the medicines
of salvation inflict death upon the weak, not because of their own nature
but because of his weakness? God made the heaven in order that thou
mayest wonder at the work, and worship the master. But others leaving
the creator alone, have worshipped the heaven; and this from their own
carelessness and senselessness. But why do I speak of the creation?
assuredly what could be more conducive to salvation than the Cross? But
this Cross has become an offense to the weak. "For the word of the Cross
is to them that are perishing, foolishness: but to those which are being
saved, it is the power of God." And again, "we preach Christ crucified,
unto Jews a stumbling-block and unto Gentiles foolishness." What could
be more fit for teaching than Paul, and the apostles? But the Apostles
became a savor of death to many. He says at least "to one a savor from
death unto death: to the other a savor from life unto life." Dost thou see
that the weak is hurt even by Paul, but the strong is injured not even by
the Devil?

4. Dost thou wish that we should exercise the argument in the case of
Jesus Christ? What is equal to that salvation? what more profitable than
that presence? But this very saving presence, so profitable, became an

additional means of chastening to many. "For judgment" saith he "came I
into this world, that they which see not may see, and that they which see
may become blind." What dost thou say? The light became a cause of
blindness? The light did not become a cause of blindness, but the weakness
of the eyes of the soul was not able to entertain the light. Thou hast seen
that a weak man is hurt on all sides, but the strong is benefited on all sides
For in every case, the purpose is the cause, in every case the disposition is
master. Since the Devil, if thou wouldest understand it, is even profitable
to us, if we use him aright, and benefits us greatly, and we gain no ordinary
advantages; and this, we shewed in a small degree from the case of Job.
And it is possible also to learn this from Paul: for writing about the
fornicator he thus speaks "Deliver such an one unto Satan for the
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved." Behold even the
Devil has become a cause of salvation, but not because of his own
disposition, but because of the skill of the Apostle. For as the physicians
taking serpents and cutting off their destructive members, prepare
medicines for antidotes; so also did Paul. He took whatever was profitable
of the chastening that proceeds from the Devil, and left the rest alone; in
order that thou mayest learn that the Devil is not the cause of salvation,
but that he hasted to destroy and devour mankind. But that the Apostle
through his own wisdom cut his throat: hear in the second epistle to the
Corinthians, what he saith about this very fornicator, "confirm your love
towards him," "lest by any means such an one should be swallowed up by
over much sorrow." And, "we be taken advantage of by Satan." We have
snatched beforehand the man from the gullet of the wild beast, he saith.
For the Apostle often used the Devil as an executioner. For the
executioners punish those who have done wrong, not as they choose, but
as the judges allow. For this is the rule for the executioner, to take
vengeance, giving heed to the command of the judge. Dost thou see to what
a dignity the Apostle mounted? He who was invested with a body, used
the bodiless as an executioner; and that which their common master saith
to the Devil, concerning Job: charging him thus, "Touch his flesh, but thou
shall not touch his life;" giving him a limit, and measure of vengeance, in
order that the wild beast might not be impetuous and leap upon him too
shamelessly; this too the Apostle does. For delivering the fornicator over
to him he says "For the destruction of the flesh," that is "thou shall not
touch his life." Dost thou see the authority of the servant? Fear not

therefore the Devil, even if he be bodiless: for he has come in contact with
him. And nothing is weaker than he who has come into such contact even
though he be not invested with a body, as then nothing is stronger than he
who has boldness even though he bear about a mortal body.

5. All these things have been now said by me, not in order that I may
discharge the Devil from blame, but that I may free you from slothfulness.
For he wishes extremely to attribute the cause of our sins to himself, in
order that we being nourished by these hopes, and entering on all kinds of
evil, may increase the chastening in our own case, and may meet with no
pardon from having transferred the cause to him. Just as Eve met with
none. But let us not do this. But let us know ourselves. Let us know our
wounds. For thus shall we be able to apply the medicines. For he who
does not know his disease, will give no care to his weakness. We have
sinned much: I know this well. For we are all liable for penalties. But we
are not deprived of pardon; nor shall we fall away from repentance for we
still stand in the arena, and are in the struggles of repentance. Art thou old,
and hast thou come to the last outlet of life? Do not consider even thus
that thou hast fallen from repentance, nor despair of thine own salvation,
but consider the robber who was freed on the cross. For what was briefer
than that hour in which he was crowned? Yet notwithstanding even this
was enough for him, for salvation. Art thou young? Do not be confident in
thy youth, nor think that thou hast a very fixed term of life, "For the day
of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night." On this account he has made
our end invisible, in order that we might make our diligence and our
forethought plain. Dost thou not see men taken away prematurely day
after day? On this account a certain one admonishes "make no tarrying to
turn to the Lord and put not off from day to day," lest at any time, as
thou delayest, thou art destroyed. Let the old man keep this admonition,
let the young man take this advice. Yea, art thou in security, and art thou
rich, and dost thou abound in wealth, and does no affliction happen to
thee? Still hear what Paul says "when they say peace and safety, then
sudden destruction cometh upon them." Affairs are full of much change.
We are not masters of our end. Let us be masters of virtue. Our Master
Christ is loving.

6. Do you wish that I shall speak of the ways of repentance? They are
many, and various, and different, and all lead to heaven. The first way of

repentance is condemnation of sins. "Declare thou first thy sins that thou
mayest be justified." Wherefore also the prophet said "I said, I will speak
out, my transgression to the Lord, and thou remittedst the iniquity of my
heart." Condemn thyself therefore for thy sins. This is enough for the
Master by way of self-defense. For he who condemns his sins, is slower
to fall into them again. Awake thy conscience, that inward accuser, in
order that thou mayest have no accuser at the judgment seat of the Lord.
This is one way of repentance, the best; and there is another not less than
this, not to bear a grudge against thine enemies to overcome anger, to
forgive the sins of our fellow-servants. For so will those which have been
done against the master be forgiven us. See the second expiation of sins:
"For if ye forgive" saith he, "your debtors, your Heavenly Father will also
forgive you." Dost thou wish to learn a third way of repentance? Fervent
and diligent prayer, and to do this from the bottom of the heart. Hast thou
not seen that widow, how she persuaded the shameless judge? But thou
hast a gentle Master, both tender, and kind. She asked, against her
adversaries, but thou dost not ask against thine adversaries, but on behalf
of thine own salvation. And if thou wouldest learn a fourth way, I will say
almsgiving. For this has a great power and unspeakable. For Daniel saith to
Nebuchadnezzar when he had come to all kinds of evil, and had entered
upon all impiety, "O King let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, redeem
thy sins by almsgiving and thine iniquities by compassion on the poor."
What could be compared with this lovingkindness? After countless sins,
after so many transgressions, he is promised that he will be reconciled
with him he has come into conflict with if he will show kindness to his
own fellow-servants. And modesty, and humility, not less than all words
spoken, exhaust the nature of sins. And the publican is proof, being unable
to declare his good deeds, in sight of all, bringing forward his humility, and
laying aside the heavy burden of his sins. See we have shewn five ways of
repentance: first the condemnation of sins, next the forgiveness of our
neighbors' sins, thirdly that which comes of prayer, fourth that which
comes of almsgiving, fifth that which comes of humility. Do not thou then
be lazy; but walk in all these day by day. For the ways are easy, nor canst
thou plead poverty. And even if thou livest poorer than all, thou art able
to leave thine anger, and be humble, and to pray fervently, and to condemn
sins, and thy poverty is in no way a hindrance. And why do I speak thus,
when not even in that way of repentance in which it is possible to spend

money (I speak of almsgiving), not even there is poverty any hindrance to
us from obeying the command? The widow who spent the two mites is a
proof. Having learned then the healing of our wounds, let us constantly
apply these medicines, in order that we may return to health and enjoy the
sacred table with assurance; and with much glory, reach Christ the king of
glory, and attain to everlasting good by the grace, and compassion, and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom be
glory, power, honor, to the Father, together with the all holy, and good
and quickening Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 3

THAT EVIL COMES OF SLOTH, AND VIRTUE FROM DILIGENCE,
AND THAT NEITHER WICKED MEN, NOR THE DEVIL HIMSELF,
ARE ABLE TO DO THE WARY MAN ANY HARM. THE PROOF OF
THIS FROM MANY PASSAGES, AND AMONGST OTHERS
FROM THOSE WHICH RELATE TO ADAM AND TO JOB

1. THE day before yesterday we set on foot our sermon concerning the
Devil, out of our love for you. But others, the day before yesterday while
these matters were being set on foot here, took their places in the theater,
and were looking on at the Devil's show. They were taking part in
lascivious songs; ye were having a share in spiritual music. They were
eating of the Devil's garbage: ye were feeding on spiritual unguents. Who
pray decoyed them? Who pray separated them from the sacred flock? Did
the Devil pray deceive them? How did he not deceive you? you and they
are men alike; I mean as regards your nature. You and they have the same
soul, you have the same desires, so far as nature is concerned. How is it
then that you and they were not in the same place? Because you and they
have not the same purpose. On this account they indeed are under
deception, but you beyond deception. I do not say these things again as
discharging the Devil from accusation, but as desiring earnestly to free you
from sins. The Devil is wicked; I grant this indeed, but he is wicked for
himself not towards us if we are wary. For the nature of wickedness is of
this kind. It is destructive to those alone who hold to it. Virtue is the
contrary. It is not only able to profit those who hold to it, but those
nearest at hand too. And in order that thou mayest learn that evil is evil in
itself, but good is also good to others, I provide thee with proverbial
evidence: "My son" saith he "if thou art become evil, thou shall bear thine
evils alone, but if wise, for thyself and thy neighbor."

They were deceived in the theater, but ye were not deceived. This is the
greatest proof of things, a clear testimony, and unquestionable reasoning,
that in every case, the purpose is master. Do thou accordingly use this
method of proof, and if thou seest a man living in wickedness, and
exhibiting all kinds of evil; then blaming the providence of God, and saying

that by the necessity of fortune and fate and through tyranny of Demons
He gave us our nature, and on all sides shifting the cause from himself
indeed, and transferring it to the creator who provides for all; silence his
speech not by word, but by deed, shewing him mother fellow servant
living in virtue and forbearance. There is no need of long speeches, no need
of a complex plan, nor even of syllogisms. By means of deeds the proof is
brought about. He said to him: thou art a servant, and he is a servant; thou
art a man and he is a man. Thou livest in the same world: thou art
nourished with the same nourishment under the same heaven: How is it
that thou art living in wickedness, he in virtue? on this account God
allowed the wicked to be mingled with the good; and did not give one law
to the wicked indeed, and appointed another world as a colony for the
good, but mixed these and those; conferring great benefit. For the good
appear more thoroughly approved when they are in the midst of those
who try to hinder them from living rightly, and who entice them to evil,
and yet keep hold of virtue. "For there must" he saith "be also heresies
among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among
you."

Therefore also on this account he has left the wicked to be in the world, in
order that the good may shine the brighter. Dost thou see how great is the
gain? But the gain is not owing to the wicked, but owing to the courage of
the good. On this account also we admire Noe, not because he was
righteous nor yet because he was perfect alone, but because in that
perverse and wicked generation he preserved his virtue, when he had no
pattern of virtue, when all men invited him to wickedness; and he went his
whole way contrary to them, like some traveler, pursuing his way while
the great multitude is being born along vehemently. On this account he did
not simply say "Noe was just, perfect," but added "in his generation" in
that perverse, that desperate generation, when there was no acquisition of
virtue. To the good indeed then this was the gain from the wicked. Thus at
all events; also trees tossed about by contrary winds, become stronger.
And there is a gain to the wicked from their mixing with the good. They
feel confusion, they are ashamed, they blush in their presence; and even if
they do not abstain from evil, yet nevertheless they dare what they dare
with secrecy. And this is no small thing not to have transgression publicly
committed. For the life of the others becomes the accuser of the

wickedness of these. Hear at least what they say about the righteous man.
"He is grievous to us, even when beheld," and it is no small beginning of
amendment to be tormented at his presence. For if the sight of the
righteous man did not torment them, this word would not have been
uttered. But to be stung, and pinched in conscience at his presence, would
be no little hindrance to indulging in wickedness with pleasure, Dost thou
see how great is the gain both to the good from the wicked, and to the
wicked from the good? On this account God has not set them apart, but
allowed them to be mingled together.

2. Let our argument also about the Devil be the same. For on this account
He hath left him also to be here, in order that he might render thee the
stronger, in order that he may make the athlete more illustrious, in order
that the contests may be greater. When therefore any one says, why has
God left the Devil here? say these words to him, because he not only does
no harm to the war and the heedful, but even profits them, not owing to
his own purpose (for that is wicked), but owing to their courage who have
used that wickedness aright. Since he even fixed upon Job not on this
account that he might make him more illustrious, but in order that he might
upset him. On this account he is wicked both because of such an opinion
and such a purpose. But notwithstanding he did no harm to the righteous
man, but he rather rejoiced in the conflict as we accordingly shewed. Both
the Demon shewed his wickedness and the righteous man his courage. But
he does upset many says one: owing to their weakness, not owing to his
own strength: for this too has been already proved by many examples.
Direct thine own intention aright then, and thou shalt never receive harm
from any, but shall get the greatest gain, not only from the good but even
from the wicked. For on this account, as I have before said, God has
suffered men to be with one another, and especially the wicked with the
good, in order that they may bring them over to their own virtue. Hear at
least what Christ saith to his disciples, "The Kingdom of heaven is like
unto a woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal." So
that the righteous have the power of leaven, in order that they may
transfer the wicked to their own manner of conduct. But the righteous are
few, for the leaven is small. But the smallness in no way injures the lump,
but that little quantity converts the whole of the meal to itself by means of
the power inherent in it. So accordingly the power also of the righteous

has its force not in the magnitude of their number, but in the grace of the
Spirit. There were twelve Apostles. Dost thou see how little is the leaven?
The whole world was in unbelief. Dost thou see how great is the lump?
But those twelve turned the whole world to themselves. The leaven and
the lump had the same nature but not the same manner of conduct. On this
account he left the wicked in the midst of the good, that since they are of
the same nature as the righteous they may also become of the same
purpose.

Remember these things. With these stop the mouths of the indolent, the
dissolute, the slothful, the indisposed towards the labors of virtue, those
who accuse their common Master. "Thou hast sinned" he saith "be still."
"Do not add a second more grievous sin? It is not so grievous to sin, as
after the sin to accuse the Master. Take knowledge of the cause of the sin,
and thou wilt find that it is none other than thyself who hast sinned.
Everywhere there is a need of a good intention. I have shewn you this not
from simple reasoning only, but from the case of fellow-servants living in
the world itself. Do thou also use this proof. Thus too our common master
will judge us. Learn this method of proof, and no one will be able to reason
with you. Is any a fornicator? Shew him another who is self-restrained. Is
any covetous and rapacious? Shew him one who gives alms. Does he live
in jealousy and envy? Shew him one clean from passion. Is he overcome
by anger? Bring into the midst one who is living in wisdom, for we must
not only have recourse to ancient example, but take our models from
present times. For even today by the grace of God, good deeds are done
not less than of old. Is a man incredulous? and does he think that the
scriptures are false? Does he not believe that Job was such as he was?
Shew him another man, emulating the life of that righteous person. Thus
will the Master also judge us: He places fellow servants with
fellow-servants, nor does he give sentence according to his own judgment,
in order that no one may begin to say again, as that servant said, who was
entrusted with the talent, and who instead of a talent brought the
accusation. "Thou art an austere man." For he ought to mourn, because he
did not double the talent, but rendered his sin the more grievous, by adding
to his own idleness, his accusation against the Master. For what saith he?
"I knew thee that thou art an austere man." O miserable, and wretched,
ungrateful and lazy man! Thou oughtest to have accused thine own

idleness, and to have taken away somewhat from thy former sin. But thou
in bringing an account against the master hast doubled thy sin instead of
doubling thy talent.

3. On this account God places together servants and servants in order that
the one set may judge the other, and that some being judged by the others
may not be able for the future to accuse the master. On this account, he
saith "The Son of Man cometh in the glory of his Father." See the equality
of the glory: he does not say in glory like to the glory of the Father, but in
the glory of the Father, and will gather together all the nations. Terrible is
the tribunal: terrible to the sinful, and the accountable. Since to those who
are conscious to themselves of good works, it is desirable and mild. "And
he will place the sheep on his right hand, and the kids on his left." Both
these and those are men. For what reason then are those indeed sheep but
these kids? Not that thou mayest learn a difference in their nature, but the
difference in their purpose. But for what reason are the who did not show
compassion kids? Because that animal is unfruitful and is not able to
contribute services, either by its milk, or by progeny, or by its hair, to
those who possess it, being on all sides destitute of such a contribution as
this, on account of the immaturity of its age. On this account he has called
those who bear no fruit, by comparison, kids, but those on the right hand
sheep. For from these the offering is great, both of their natural wool, their
progeny, and their milk. What then does he say to them? "Ye saw me
hungering and ye fed me, naked and ye clothed me, a stranger and ye took
me in." Again to those he says the contrary. And yet both these and those
were alike men, both these and those received the same promises, the same
rewards were assigned to both on doing right. The same person came both
to these and to those, with the same nakedness: and to these and to those
with the same hunger, and in the same way and a stranger. All things were
alike to those and to these.

How then was the end not the same? Because the purpose did not permit
it. For this alone made the difference. On this account the one set went to
Gehenna, but the other to the Kingdom. But if the Devil were the cause to
them of their sins, these would not be destined to be chastened, when
another sinned and drove them on. Dost thou see here both those who sin,
and those who do good works? Dost thou see how on seeing their
fellow-servants they were silenced? Come and let us bring our discourse to

another example for thy benefit. There were ten virgins he says. Here again
there are purposes which are upright, and purposes which are sinful, in
order thou mayest see side by side, both the sins of the one and the good
works of the others. For the comparison makes these things the plainer.
And these and those were virgins; and these were five, and also those. All
awaited the bridegroom. How then did some enter in, and others did not
enter in? Because some indeed were churlish, and others were gentle and
loving. Dost thou see again that the purpose determined the nature of the
end, not the Devil? Dost thou see that the judgments were parallel, and
that the verdict given proceeds from those who are like each other?
Fellow-servants will judge fellow-servants. Dost thou wish that I should
shew thee a comparison arising from contrasts? for there is one also from
contrasts so that the condemnation may become the greater. "The men of
Nineveh" he saith "shall rise up, and shall condemn this generation." The
judged are no longer alike, for the one are barbarians, the others are Jews.
The one enjoyed prophetic teaching, the others were never partakers of a
divine instruction. And this is not the only difference, but the fact that in
that case a servant went to them, in this the master; and that man came and
proclaimed an overthrow; but this man declared the glad tidings of a
kingdom of heaven. Which of these was it the more likely, would believe?
The barbarians, and ignorant, and they who had never partaken of divine
teaching, or they who had from their earliest age been trained in prophetic
books? To every one, it is plain, that the Jews would be more likely to
believe. But the contrary took place. And these disbelieved the Master
when he preached a kingdom of heaven, but those believed their
fellow-servant when he threatened an overthrow: in order that their
goodness, and these men's folly might be manifested to a greater degree. Is
there a Demon? a Devil? chance? or Fate? has not each become the cause
to himself both of evil, and of virtue? For if they themselves were not to
be liable to account, he would not have said that they shall judge this
generation. Nor would he have said that the Queen of the South would
condemn the Jews. For then indeed not only will one people condemn
another people, but one man will often judge a whole people, when they
who, it is allowed, might readily have been deceived, are found to remain
undeceived, and they who ought in every way to have the advantage, turn
out to be worsted. On this account, we made mention of Adam and of Job,
for there is necessity to revert to that subject, so as to put the finish to our

discourse. He attacked Adam indeed by means of mere words, but Job by
means of deeds. For the one he denuded of all his wealth, and deprived of
his children. But from this man he took not away anything, great or little
of his possessions. But let us rather examine the very words and the
method of the plot. "The serpent came" saith he "and said to the woman,
What is it that God hath said, ye shall not eat of every tree which is in the
garden" Here it is a serpent; there a woman, in the case of Job: mean while
great is the difference between the counselors. The one is a servant, the
other a partner of the man's life. She is a helpmate, but the other is under
subjection. Dost thou see how unpardonable this is? Eve indeed, the
servant in subjection deceived: but him not even his partner, and helpmate
could overthrow. But let us see what he saith. "What is this that God hath
said, thou shalt not eat of every tree?" Assuredly indeed God did not say
this but the opposite. See the villainy of the Devil. He said that which was
not spoken, in order that he might learn what was spoken. What then did
the woman? She ought to have silenced him, she ought not to have
exchanged a word with him. In foolishness she declared the judgment of
the Master. Thereby she afforded the Devil a powerful handle.

4. See what an evil it is to commit ourselves rashly to our enemies, and to
conspirators against us. On this account Christ used to say, "Give not
holy things to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before the swine, lest
they turn and rend you."(5 And this happened in the case of Eve. She gave
the holy things to the dog, to the swine. He trod under foot the words: and
turned and rent the woman. And see how he works evil. "Ye shall not die
the death" saith heft

Give me your attention on this point, that the woman was able to
understand the deceit. For he immediately announced his enmity, and his
warfare against God, he immediately contradicted Him. Let it be so. Before
this thou declaredst the judgment to one who wished to learn it. After this
why didst thou follow one who said the opposite? God said ye shall die
the death." The Devil made answer to this and said "ye shall not die the
death." What could be clearer than this warfare? From what other quarter
ought one to learn the enemy and the foe, than from his answer returned to
God? She ought then immediately to have fled from the bait, she ought to
have started back from the snare. "Ye shall not die the death," saith he "for
God knoweth, that on the day on which ye eat, your eyes shall be opened,

and ye shall be as Gods. In hope of a greater promise she cast away the
goods in her hand. He promised that he would make them Gods, and cast
them down into the tyranny of death. Whence then O woman didst thou
believe the Devil? What good didst thou discern? Was not the
trustworthiness of the lawgiver sufficient to prove that the one was God,
both creator and framer of the world, and the other the Devil and an
enemy? And I do not say the Devil. Thou thoughtest that he was a mere
serpent. Ought a serpent to claim such equality that thou shouldest tell
him the Master's judgment? Thou seest that it was possible to perceive
the deceit, but she would not, and yet God gave many proofs of his own
beneficence and shewed forth his care of his works. For he formed man,
who had not existed before; and breathed a soul into him, and made him
according to his image, making him ruler of all things upon the earth, and
granted him a helpmate, planted Paradise, and having committed to him the
use of the rest of the trees, refused him the taste of one only: and this very
prohibition he made for man's advantage. But the Devil manifested no
good things by his deed, whether little, or great: but exciting the woman
with mere words and puffing her up with vain hopes, thus he deceived her.
But nevertheless she considered the Devil to be more worthy of credit
than God, although God shewed forth his good will by his works. The
woman believed in one who professed mere words, and nothing else. Dost
thou see how, from folly alone and sloth, and not from force, the deceit
happened? and in order that thou mayest learn it more clearly hear how
the scripture accuses the woman: For it does not say, being deceived, but
"seeing the tree that it was fair, she ate." So that the blame belongs to her
uncontrolled vision, not to the deceit alone which comes from the Devil.
For she was defeated by yielding to her own desire, not by the
wickedness. of the Demon. On this count she did not have the benefit of
pardon, but though she said, "the serpent deceived me," she paid the
uttermost penalty. For it was in her power not to have fallen. And in order
that thou mayest understand this more clearly, come, let us conduct our
discourse to the case of Job; from the defeated to the vanquisher, from the
conquered to the conqueror. For this man will give us greater zeal, so that
we may raise our hands against the Devil. There he who deceived and
conquered was a serpent; here the tempter was a woman, and she did not
prevail: and yet at least she was far more persuasive than he. For to Job
after the destruction of his wealth, after the loss of his children, after being

stripped bare of all his goods, her wiles were added. But in the other case
there was nothing of this kind. Adam did not suffer the destruction! of his
children, nor did he lose his wealth: he did not sit upon a dunghill, but
inhabited a Paradise of luxury and enjoyed all manner of fruits, and
fountains and rivers, and every other kind of security. Nowhere was there
labor or pain, or despair and cares, or reproaches, and insults, or the
countless ills which assailed Job: but nevertheless, when nothing of this
kind existed, he fell and was overthrown. Is it not evident that it was on
account of sloth? Even so therefore as the other, when all these things
beset him, and weighed upon him, stood nobly and did not fall, is it not
evident that his steadfastness was owing to his vigilance of soul?

5. On both sides, beloved, reap the utmost gain, and avoid the imitation of
Adam knowing how many ills are begotten of indolence: and imitate the
piety of Job, learning how many glorious things spring from earnestness.
Consider him, the conqueror throughout, and thou shall have much
consolation in all pain: and peril. For as it were in the common theater of
the world that blessed and noble man stands forth, and by means of the
sufferings which happened to him discourses to all to bear all things which
befall them nobly, and never give in to. the troubles which come upon
them. For verily, there is no human suffering which cannot receive
consolation from thence. For the sufferings which are scattered over the
whole world, these came together, and bore down upon one body, even
his. What pardon then shall there be for him who is unable to bear with
thankfulness his share of the troubles which are brought upon him? Since
he appears not bearing a part only, but the entire ills of all men, and in
order that thou mayest not condemn the extravagance of my words, come,
and let us take in hand severally the ills that came upon him, and bring
forward this fulfillment of them. And if thou wishest, let us first bring
forward that which seems to be the most unendurable of all, I mean
poverty, and the pain which arises from it. For everywhere all men bewail
this. What was poorer then than Job, who was poorer than the outcasts at
the baths, and those who sleep in the ashes of the furnace, poorer in fact
than all men? For these indeed have one ragged garment, but he sat naked,
and had only the garment which nature supplies, the clothing of the flesh,
and this the Devil destroyed on all sides, with a distressing kind of decay.
Again these poor folk are at least under the roof of the porches at the

baths, and are covered with a shelter. But he continued always to pass his
nights in the open air, not having even the consolation of a bare roof. And,
what is still greater, the fact that these are conscious of many terrible evils
within themselves, but he was conscious of nothing against himself. For
this is to be noticed in each of the things which happened to him, a thing
which caused him greater pain, and produced more perplexity; the
ignorance of the reason of what took place. These persons then, as I said,
would have many things with which to reproach themselves. And this
contributes no little to consolation in calamity; to be conscious in oneself
of being punished justly. But he was deprived of this consolation, and
while exhibiting a conversation full of virtue, endured the fate of those who
had dared to do extreme wickedness. And these folk who are with us, are
poor from the outset, and from the beginning are versed in calamity. But
he endured calamity in which he was unversed, experiencing the immense
change from wealth. As then the knowledge of the cause of what takes
place, is the greatest consolation; so it is not less than this, to have been
versed in poverty from the beginning, and so to continue in it. Of both
these consolations that man was deprived, and not even then, did he fall
away. Dost thou see him indeed come to extreme poverty, even in
comparison with which it is impossible to find a fellow? For what could
be poorer than the naked who has not even a roof over him? Yea rather not
even was it in his power to enjoy the bare ground, but he sat upon the
dunghill. Therefore whenever thou seest thyself come to poverty, consider
the suffering of the just one, and straightway thou shalt rise up, and shake
off every thought of despondency. This one calamity therefore seems to
men to be the groundwork of all sufferings together. And the second after
it, yea rather before it, is the affliction of the body. Who then was even so
disabled? Who endured such disease? Who received or saw any one else
receive so great an affliction? No one. Little by little his body was wasted,
and a stream of worms on every side issued from his limbs, the running
was constant, and the evil smell which surrounded him was strong, and the
body being destroyed little by little, and decaying with such putrefaction,
used to make food distasteful and hunger was to him strange and unusual.
For not even was he able to enjoy the nourishment which was given to
him. For saith he "I see my food to be loathsome." Whenever then thou
fallest into weakness, O man, remember that body and that saintly flesh.
For it was saintly and pure, even when it had so many wounds. And if

any one belong to the army, and then unjustly and without any reasonable
pretext, be hanged upon the pillory, and has his sides rasped to pieces, let
him not think the matter to be a reproach, nor let him give way to the pain
when he thinks upon this saint. But this man, says one, has much comfort
and consolation in knowing that God was bringing these sufferings upon
him. This indeed especially troubled and disturbed him, to think that the
just God who had in every way been served By him, was at war with him.
And he was not able to find any reasonable pretext for what took place,
since, when at least he afterwards learned the cause, see what piety he
shewed, for when God said to him "Dost thou think that I have had
dealings with thee in order that thou mightest appear righteous?"
conscious-stricken he says "I will lay my hand upon my mouth, once have
I spoken but to a second word I will not proceed," and again "as far as the
hearing of the ear I have heard thee before, but now mine eye hath seen
thee, wherefore I have held myself to be vile, and am wasted away, and I
consider myself to be earth and ashes.

6. But if thou thinkest that this is sufficient for consolation, thou wilt
thyself also be able to experience this comfort. And even if thou dost not
suffer any of these misfortunes at the hands of God but owing to the
insolence of men; and yet givest thanks and dost not blaspheme him who
is able to prevent them indeed, but who permits them for the sake of
testing thee: just as they who suffer at the hands of God are crowned, so
also thou shalt obtain the same reward, because thou hast born nobly the
calamities which were brought upon thee from men, and didst give thanks
to him who was able indeed to hinder them, but not willing.

Behold then! thou hast seen poverty and disease, and both in the
extremest degree brought upon this just man. Dost thou wish that I should
shew thee the warfare at nature's hands, in such excessive degree waged
then against this noble man? He lost ten children, the ten at one fell
swoop, the ten in the very bloom of youth, ten who displayed much
virtue, and that not by the common law of nature, but by a violent and
pitiable death. Who could be able to recount so great a calamity? No one.
Whenever therefore thou losest son and daughter together, have recourse
to this just man, and thou shalt find altogether much comfort for thyself.
Were these then the only misfortunes which happened to him? The
desertion and treachery of his friends, and the gibes, and raillery, and the

mockery and derision, and the tearing in pieces by all, was something
intolerable. For the character of calamities is not of such a kind, that they
who reproach us about our calamities are wont to vex our soul. Not only
was there no one to soothe him but many even on many sides beset him
with taunts. And thou seest him lamenting this bitterly, and saying "but
even you too fell upon me." And he calls them pitiless, and says "My
neighbors have rejected me, and my servants spake against me, and I called
the sons of my concubines, and they turned away from me." "And others"
saith he "sport upon me, and I became the common talk of all. And my
very raiment" saith he "abhorred me" These things at least are unbearable
to hear, still more to endure in their reality, extreme poverty, and
intolerable disease new and strange, the loss of children so many and so
good, and in such a manner, reproaches and gibes, and insults from men.
Some indeed mocked and some reproached and others despised; not only
enemies, but even friends; not only friends, but even servants, and they
not only mock and reproach, but even abhorred him, and this not for two
or three, or ten days, but for many months; and (a circumstance which
happened in that man's case alone) not even had he comfort by night, but
the delusions of terrors by night were a greater aggravation of his
misfortunes by day. For that he endured more grievous things in his sleep,
hear what he says "why dost thou frighten me in sleep, and terrify me in
visions?" What man of iron what heart of steel could have endured so
many misfortunes? For if each of these was unbearable in itself, consider
what a tumult their simultaneous approach excited. But nevertheless he
bore all these, and in all that happened to him he sinned not, nor was there
guile in his lips.

7. Let the sufferings of that man then be the medicines for our ills, and his
grievous surging sea the harbor of our sufferings, and in each of the
accidents which befall us, let us consider this saint, and seeing one person
exhausting the misfortunes of the universe, we shall conduct ourselves
bravely in those which fall to our share, and as to some affectionate
mother, stretching forth her hands on all sides, and receiving and reviving
her terrified children, so let us always flee to this book, and even if the
pitiable troubles of all men assail us, let us take sufficient comfort for all
and so depart. And if thou sayest, he was Job, and for this reason bore all
this, but I am not like him; thou suppliest me with a greater accusation

against thyself and fresh praise of him. For it is more likely that thou
shouldest be able to bear all this than he. Why pray? Because he indeed
was before the day of grace and of the law, when there was not much
strictness of life, when the grace of the Spirit was not so great, when sin
was hard to fight against, when the curse prevailed and when death was
terrible. But now our wrestlings have become easier, all these things being
removed after the coming of Christ; so that we have no excuse, when we
are unable to reach the same standard as he, after so long a time, and such
advantage, and so many gifts given to us by God. Considering therefore all
these things, that misfortunes were greater for him, and that when the
conflict was more grievous, then he stripped for the contest; let us bear all
that comes upon us nobly, and with much thankfulness, in order that we
may be able to obtain the same crown as he, by the grace and
lovingkindness of Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom be glory to the Father
together with the Holy Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever.
Amen.

ON THE PASSAGE "FATHER IF IT BE POSSIBLE LET THIS CUP
PASS FROM ME, NEVERTHELESS NOT AS I WILL BUT AS THOU
WILT:" AND AGAINST MARCIONISTS AND MANICHAEANS:
ALSO, THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO RUSH INTO DANGER, BUT
TO PREFER THE WILL OF GOD BEFORE EVERY OTHER WILL

1. I LATELY inflicted a severe stroke upon those who are grasping and wish
to overreach others; I did this not in order to wound them but in order to
correct them; not because I hate the men, but because I detest their
wickedness. For so the physician also lances the abscess, not as making an
attack upon the suffering body, but as a means of contending with the
disorder and the wound. Well today let us grant them a little respite, that
they may recover from their distress, and not recoil from the remedy by
being perpetually afflicted. Physicians also act thus; after the use of the
knife they apply plasters and drugs, and let a few days pass whilst they
devise things to allay the pain. Following their example let me today,
devising means for them to derive benefit from my discourse, start a
question concerning doctrine, directing my speech to the words which
have been read. For I imagine that many feel perplexed as to the reason
why these words were uttered by Christ: and it is probable also that any
heretics who are present may pounce upon the words, and thereby upset
many of the more simple-minded brethren.

In order then to build a wall against their attack and to relieve those who
are in perplexity from bewilderment and confusion, let us take in hand the
words which have been cited, and dwell upon the passage, and dive into
the depths of its meanings. For reading does not suffice unless knowledge
also be added to it. Even as the eunuch of Candace read, but until one came
who instructed him in the meaning of what he was reading he derived no
great benefit from it. In order therefore that you may not be in the same
condition attend to what is said, exert your understanding, let me have
your mind disengaged from other thoughts, let your eye be quick-sighted,
your intention earnest: let your soul be set free from worldly cares, that
we may not sow our words upon the thorns, or upon the rock, or by the

way side, but that we may till a deep and rich field, and so reap an
abundant harvest. For if you thus attend to what is said you will render
my labor lighter and facilitate the discovery of that which you are seeking.

What then is the meaning of the passage which has been read "Father if it
be possible let this cup pass from me?" What does the saying mean? For
we ought to unlock the passage by first giving a clear interpretation of the
words. What then does the saying mean? "Father if it be possible take
away the cross." How sayest thou? is he ignorant whether this be possible
or impossible? Who would venture to say this? Yet the words are those of
one who is ignorant: for the addition of the word "if," is indicative of
doubt: but as I said we must not attend to the words merely, but turn our
attention to the sense, and learn the aim of the speaker, and the cause and
the occasion, and by putting all these things together turn out the hidden
meaning. The unspeakable Wisdom then, who knoweth the Father even as
the Father knoweth the Son, how should he have been ignorant of this?
For this knowledge concerning His passion was not greater than the
knowledge concerning His essential nature, which He alone accurately
knew. "For as the Father knoweth me"' He says "even so know I the
Father." And why do I speak of the only begotten Son of God? For even
the prophets appear not to have been ignorant of this fact, but to have
known it clearly, and to have declared beforehand with much assurance
that so it must come to pass, and would certainly be.

Hear at least how variously all announce the cross. First of all the
patriarch Jacob: for directing his discourse to Him he says "Out of a
tender shoot didst thou spring up:" by the word shoot signifying the
Virgin and the undefiled nature of Mary. Then indicating the cross he said
"Thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion, and as a lion's whelp; who
shall raise him up?" Here he called death a slumbering and a sleep, and
with death he combined the resurrection when he said "who shall raise him
up?" No one indeed save he himself - wherefore also Christ said "I have
power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again," and again
"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up." And what is
meant by the words "thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion?" For as
the lion is terrible not only when he is awake but even when he is sleeping,
so Christ also not only before the cross but also on the cross itself and in
the very moment of death was terrible, and wrought at that time great

miracles, turning back the light of the sun, cleaving the rocks, shaking the
earth, rending the veil, alarming the wife of Pilate, convicting Judas of sin,
for then he said "I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood;"
and the wife of Pilate declared "Have nothing to do with that just man, for
I have suffered many things in a dream because of Him." The darkness
took possession of the earth, and night appeared at midday, then death
was brought to nought, and his tyranny was destroyed: many bodies at
least of the saints which slept arose. These things the patriarch declaring
beforehand, and demonstrating that, even when crucified, Christ would be
terrible, said "thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion." He did not say
thou shall slumber but thou didst slumber because it would certainly come
to pass. For it is the custom of the prophets in many places to predict
things to come as if they were already past. For just as it is impossible
that things which have happened should not have happened, so is it
impossible that this should not happen, although it be future. On this
account they predict things to come under the semblance of past time,
indicating by this means the impossibility of their failure, the certainty of
their coming to pass. So also spake David, signifying the cross; "They
pierced my hands and my feet." He did not say they "shall pierce" but
"they pierced" "they counted all my bones." And not only does he say
this, but he also describes the things which were done by the soldiers.
"They parted my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture did
they cast lots." And not only this but he also relates they gave Him gall to
eat, and vinegar to drink. For he says "they gave me gall for my food, and
for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." And again another one says
that they smote him with a spear, for "they shall look on Him whom they
pierced." Esaias again in another fashion predicting the cross said He was
led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so
openeth he not his mouth." In his humiliation his judgment was taken
away."

2. Now observe I pray how each one of these writers speaks as if
concerning things already past, signifying by the use of this tense the
absolute inevitable certainty of the event. So also David, describing this
tribunal, said, "Why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain
things? The Kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered
together against the Lord and against his Christ." And not only does he

mention the trial, and the cross, and the incidents on the cross, but also
him who betrayed him, declaring that he was his familiar companion and
guest. "For," he saith, "he that eateth bread with me did magnify his heel
against me." Thus also does he foretell the voice which Christ was to utter
on the cross saying "My God, My God why hast thou forsaken me?" and
the burial also does he describe: "They laid me in the lowest pit, in dark
places, and in the shadow of death." And the resurrection: "thou shalt not
leave my soul in hell, neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One to see
corruption;" and the ascension: "God has gone up with a merry noise, the
Lord with the sound of the trump." And the session on the right hand:
"The Lord said to my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thy foes
thy footstool." But Esaias also declares the cause; saying, "for the
transgressions of my people is He brought to death," and because all have
strayed like sheep, therefore is he sacrificed." Then also he adds mention
of the result, saying "by his stripes we have all been healed:" and "he hath
born the sins of many." The prophets then knew the cross, and the cause
of the cross and that which was effected by it, and the burial and the
resurrection, and the ascension, and the betrayal, and the trial, and
described them all with accuracy: and is He who sent them and
commanded them to speak these things ignorant of them Himself? What
reasonable man would say that? Seest thou that we must not attend
merely to the words? For this is not the only perplexing passage, but what
follows is more perplexing. For what does He say? "Father if it be
possible let this cup pass from me." Here he will be found to speak not
only as if ignorant, but as if deprecating the cross: For this is what He
says. "If it be permissible let me not be subjected to crucifixion and
death." And yet when Peter, the leader of the apostles, said this to Him,
"Be it far from thee Lord, this shall not happen unto Thee," He rebuked
him so severely as to say; "get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offense
unto me, for thou savorest not the things which be of God, but those
which be of men:" although a short time before he had pronounced him
blessed. But to escape crucifixion seemed to Him so monstrous a thing,
that him who had received the revelation from the Father, him whom He
had pronounced blessed, him who had received the keys of Heaven, He
called Satan, and an offense, and accused him of not savoring the things
which be of God because he said to Him, "Be it far from thee Lord, this
shall never be unto Thee" - namely crucifixion. He then who thus

vituperated the disciple, and poured such an invective upon him as
actually to call him Satan (after having bestowed such great praise on him),
because he said "avoid crucifixion," how could He desire not to be
crucified? and how after these things when drawing the picture of the good
shepherd could He declare this to be the special proof of his virtue, that he
should be sacrificed for the sake of the sheep, thus saying, "I am the good
shepherd; the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep?" Nor did
He even stop there, but also added, "but he that is an hireling and not the
shepherd seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth." If then
it is the sign of the good shepherd to sacrifice himself, and of the hireling
to be unwilling to undergo this, how can He who calls Himself the good
shepherd beseech that he may not be sacrificed? And how could He say "I
lay down my life of myself"? For if thou layest down thy life of thyself,
how canst thou beseech another that thou mayest not lay it down? And
how is it that Paul marvels at Him on account of this declaration, saying
"Who being in the form of God counted it not a prize to be on an equality
with God, but emptied Himself taking the form of a servant, being made in
the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man he humbled
himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross."
And He Himself again speaks in this wise, "For this cause doth my Father
love me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again." For if He
does not desire to lay it down, but deprecates the act, and beseeches the
Father, how is it that He is loved on this account? For love is of those who
are like minded. And how does Paul say again "Love one another even as
Christ also loved us and gave Himself for us?" And Christ Himself when
He was about to be crucified said "Father, the hour has come: glorify thy
Son," speaking of the cross as glory: and how then does He deprecate it
here when He urges it there? For that the cross is glory listen to what the
evangelist says "the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified." Now the hearing of this expression is "grace was not yet
given because the enmity towards men was not yet destroyed by reason
that the cross had not yet done its work." For the cross destroyed the
enmity of God towards man, brought about the reconciliation, made the
earth Heaven, associated men with angels, pulled down the citadel of
death, unstrung the force of the devil, extinguished the power of sin,
delivered the world from error, brought back the truth, expelled the
Demons, destroyed temples, overturned altars, suppressed the sacrificial

offering, implanted virtue, rounded the Churches. The cross is the will of
the Father, the glory of the Son, the rejoicing of the Spirit, the boast of
Paul, "for," he says, "God forbid that I should boast save in the cross of
our Lord Jesus Christ." The cross is that which is brighter than the sun,
more brilliant than the sunbeam: for when the sun is darkened then the
cross shines brightly: and the sun is darkened not because it is
extinguished, but because it is overpowered by the brilliancy of the cross.
The cross has broken our bond, it has made the prison of death ineffectual,
it is the demonstration of the love of God. "For God so loved the world
that He gave His only-begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him
should not perish." And again Paul says "If being enemies we were
reconciled to God by the death of His Son." The cross is the impregnable
wall, the invulnerable shield, the safeguard of the rich, the resource of the
poor, the defense of those who are exposed to snares, the armor of those
who are attacked, the means of suppressing passion, and of acquiring
virtue, the wonderful and marvelous sign. "For this generation seeketh
after a sign: and no sign shall be given it save the sign of Jonas"; and again
Paul says, "for the Jews ask for a sign and the Greeks seek wisdom, but
we preach Christ crucified." The cross opened Paradise, it brought in the
robber, it conducted into the kingdom of Heaven the race of man which
was about to perish, and was not worthy even of earth. So great are the
benefits which have sprung and do spring from the cross, and yet doth He
not desire to be crucified I ask? Who would venture to say this? And if He
did not desire it who compelled Him, who forced Him to it? and why did
He send prophets beforehand announcing that He would be crucified, if He
was not to be, and did not wish to undergo it? And for what reason does
He call the cross a cup, if He did not desire to be crucified? For that is the
word of one who signifies the desire which he has concerning the act. For
as the cup is sweet to those who are thirsty so also was crucifixion to
Him: wherefore also He said "With desire have I desired to eat this
Passover with you," and this He meant not absolutely, but relatively,
because after that evening the cross was awaiting Him.

3. He then who calls the thing glory, and rebukes the disciple because he
was trying to hinder Him, and proves that what constitutes the good
shepherd is his sacrificing himself on behalf of the sheep, and declares that
he earnestly longs for this thing, and willingly goes to meet it, how is it

that He beseeches it may not come to pass? And if He did not wish it
what difficulty was there in hindering those who came for that purpose?
But in fact you behold Him hastening towards the deed. At least when
they came upon Him He said "Whom seek ye?" and they replied "Jesus."
Then He saith to them "Lo! I am He: and they went backward and fell to
the ground." Thus having first crippled them and proved that He was able
to escape their hands, He then surrendered Himself, that thou mightest
learn that not by compulsion or force, or the tyrannical power of those
who attacked Him, did He unwillingly submit to this, but willingly with
purpose and desire, preparing for it a long time before. Therefore also were
prophets sent beforehand, and patriarchs foretold the events, and by
means of words and deeds the cross was prefigured. For the sacrifice of
Isaac also signified the cross to us: wherefore also Christ said "Abraham
your father rejoiced to see my glory and he saw it and was glad." The
patriarch then was glad beholding the image of the cross, and does He
Himself deprecate it? Thus Moses also prevailed over Amalek when he
displayed the figure of the cross: and one may observe countless things
happening in the Old Testament descriptive by anticipation of the cross.
For what reason then was this the case if He who was to be crucified did
not wish it to come to pass? And the sentence which follows this is yet
more perplexing. For having said "Let this cup pass from me He added
"nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt." For herein as far as the actual
expression is concerned we find two wills opposed to one another: if at
least the Father desires Him to be crucified, but He Himself does not
desire it. And yet we everywhere behold Him desiring and purposing the
same things as the Father. For when He says "grant to them, as I and
Thou are one that they also may be one in us," it is equivalent to saying
that the purpose of the Father and of the Son is one. And when He says
"The words which I speak I speak not myself, but the Father which
dwelleth in me, He doeth these works," He indicates the same thing. And
when He says "I have not come of myself" and "I can of my own self do
nothing" he does not say this as signifying that He has been deprived of
authority, either to speak or to act (away with the thought!),but as
desiring to prove the concord of his purpose, both in words and deeds, and
in every kind of transaction, to be one and the same with the Father, as I
have already frequently demonstrated. For the expression "I speak not of
myself" is not an abrogation of authority but a demonstration of

agreement. How then does He say here "Nevertheless not as I will but as
Thou wilt"? Perhaps I have excited a great conflict in your mind, but be on
the alert: for although many words have been uttered I know well that
your zeal is still fresh: for the discourse is now hastening on to the
solution. Why then has this form of speech been employed? Attend
carefully, The doctrine of the incarnation was very hard to receive. For the
exceeding measure of His lovingkindness and the magnitude of His
condescension were full of awe, and needed much preparation to be
accepted. For consider what a great thing it was to hear and to learn that
God the ineffable, the incorruptible, the unintelligible, the invisible, the
incomprehensible, in whose hand are the ends of the earth, who looketh
upon the earth, and causeth it to tremble, who toucheth the mountains,
and maketh them smoke, the weight of whose condescension not even the
Cherubim were able to bear but veiled their faces by the shelter of their
wings, that this God who surpasses all understanding, and baffles all
calculation, having passed by angels, archangels, and all the spiritual
powers above, deigned to become man, and to take flesh formed of earth
and clay, and enter the womb of a virgin, and be born there the space of
nine months, and be nourished with milk, and suffer all things to which
man is liable. Inasmuch then as that which was to happen was so strange
as to be disbelieved by many even when it had taken place, He first of all
sends prophets beforehand, announcing this very fact. For instance the
patriarch predicted it saying "Thou didst spring from a tender shoot my
son: thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion;" and Esaias saying "Behold
the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall call His name
Emmanuel;" and elsewhere again "We beheld Him as a young child, as a
root in a dry ground;" and by the dry ground he means the virgin's womb.
And again "unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given?" and again
"there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall
spring out of his root." And Baruch in the book of Jeremiah says "this is
our God: no other shall be reckoned by the side of Him: He found out
every path of knowledge and gave it to Jacob His servant, and Israel his
beloved. After these things also He appeared upon the earth, and held
converse with men." And David signifying His incarnate presence said
"He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool, and like the drop
which distills upon the earth" because He noiselessly and gently entered
into the Virgin's womb.

4. But these proofs alone did not suffice, but even when He had come, lest
what had taken place should be deemed an illusion, He warranted the fact
not only by the sight but by duration of time and by passing through all
the phases incident to man. For He did not enter once for all into a man
matured and completely developed, but into a virgin's womb, so as to
undergo the process of gestation and birth and suckling and growth, and by
the length of the time and the variety of the stages of growth to give
assurance of what had come to pass. And not even here were the proofs
concluded, but even when bearing about the body of flesh He suffered it to
experience the infirmities of human nature and to be hungry, and thirsty,
and to sleep and feel fatigue; finally also when He came to the cross He
suffered it to undergo the pains of the flesh. For this reason also streams
of sweat flowed down from it and an angel was discovered strengthening
it, and He was sad and down-cast: for before He uttered these words He
said "my soul is troubled, and exceeding sorrowful ever unto death?" If
then after all these things have taken place the wicked mouth of the devil
speaking through Marcion of Pontus, and Valentinus, and Manichaeus of
Persia and many more heretics, has attempted to overthrow the doctrine of
the Incarnation and has vented a diabolical utterance declaring that He did
not become flesh, nor was clothed with it, but that this was mere fancy,
and illusion, a piece of acting and pretense, although the sufferings, the
death, the burial, the thirst, cry aloud against this teaching; supposing that
none of these things had happened would not the devil have sown these
wicket doctrines of impiousness much more widely? For this reason, just
as He hungered, as He slept, as He felt fatigue, as He ate and drank, so also
did He deprecate death, thereby manifesting his humanity, and that
infirmity of human nature which does not submit without pain to be torn
from this present life. For had He not uttered any of these things, it might
have been said that if He were a man He ought to have experienced human
feelings. And what are these? in the case of one about to be crucified, fear
and agony, and pain in being torn from present life: for a sense of the
charm which surrounds present things is implanted in human nature: on
this account wishing to prove the reality of the fleshly clothing, and to
give assurance of the incarnation He manifests the actual feelings of man
with full demonstration.

This is one consideration, but there is another no less important. And
what is this? Christ having come to earth wished to instruct men in all
virtue: now the instructor teaches not only by word, but also by deed: for
this is the teacher's best method of teaching. A pilot for instance when he
makes the apprentice sit by his side shows him how he handles the rudder,
but he also joins speech to action, and does not depend upon words alone
or example alone: in like manner also an architect when he has placed by
his side the man who is intended to learn from him how a wall is
constructed, shows him the way by means of action as well as by means
of oral teaching; so also with the weaver, and embroiderer, and gold refiner,
and coppersmith; - and every kind of art has teachers who instruct both
orally and practically. Inasmuch then as Christ Himself came to instruct us
in all virtue, He both tells us what ought to be done, and does it. "For," he
says, "he who does and teaches the same shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven." Now observe; He commanded men to be
lowly-minded, and meek, and He taught this by His words: but see how
He also teaches it by His deeds. For having said "Blessed are the poor in
spirit, blessed are the meek," He shows how these virtues ought to be
practiced. How then did He teach them? He took a towel and girded
Himself and washed the disciples' feet. What can match this lowliness of
mind? for He teaches this virtue no longer by His words only but also by
His deeds. Again He teaches meekness and forbearance by His acts. How
so? He was struck on the face by the servant of the high priest, and said
"If I have spoken evil bear witness of the evil: but if well why smitest
thou me?" He commanded men to pray for their enemies: this also again
He teaches by means of His acts: for when He had ascended the cross He
said "Father forgive them for they know not what they do." As therefore
He commanded men to pray so does He Himself pray, instructing thee to
do so by his own unflagging utterances of prayer. Again He commanded us
to do good to those who hate us, and to deal fairly with those who treat us
despitefully: and this He did by his own acts: for he cast devils out of the
Jews, who said that He Himself was possessed by a devil, He bestowed
benefits on His persecutors, He fed those who were forming designs
against Him, He conducted into His kingdom those who were desiring to
crucify Him. Again He said to His disciples "Get you no gold nor silver
neither brass in your purses," thus training them for poverty: and this also
He taught by His example, thus saying, "Foxes have holes, and the birds

of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay His head."
And He had neither table nor dwelling nor anything else of that kind: not
because He was at a loss to obtain them, but because He was instructing
men to go in that path. After the same manner then he taught them also to
pray. They said to Him "Teach us to pray." Therefore also He prays, in
order that they may learn to pray. But it was necessary for them not
merely to learn to pray but also how they ought to pray: for this reason
He delivered to them a prayer in this form: "Our Father which art in
Heaven hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done, as in
Heaven, so on earth. Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our
debts as we also forgive our debtors: and lead us not into temptation:" that
is into danger, into snares. Since then He commanded them to pray "lead
us not into temptation," He instructs them in this very precept by putting
it in practice Himself, saying "Father if it be possible, let this cup pass
away from me, thus teaching all the saints not to plunge into dangers, not
to fling themselves into them but to wait for their approach, and to exhibit
all possible courage, only not to rush forwards themselves, or to be the
first to advance against terrors. Why so, pray? both to teach us lowliness
of mind, and also to deliver us from the charge of vainglory. On this
account it is said also in this passage that when He had spoken these
words "He went away and prayed:" and after He had prayed He speaks
thus to His disciples "Could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and
pray that ye enter not into temptation." Seest thou He not only prays but
also admonishes? "For the Spirit indeed is willing," He said, "but the flesh
is weak." Now this He said by way of emptying their soul of vanity, and
delivering them from pride, teaching them self-restraint, training them to
practice moderation. Therefore the prayer which He wished to teach them,
He Himself also offered, speaking after the manner of men, not according
to His Godhead (for the divine nature is impassable) but according to His
manhood. And He prayed as instructing us to pray, and even to seek
deliverance from distress; but, if this be not permitted, then to acquiesce in
what seems good to God. Therefore He said "Nevertheless not as I will
but as Thou wilt:" not because He had one will and the Father another; but
in order that He might instruct men even if they were in distress and
trembling, even if danger came upon them, and they were unwilling to be
torn from present life, nevertheless to postpone their own will to the will
of God: even as Paul also when he had been instructed practically

exhibited both these principles; for he besought that temptations might be
removed from him, thus saying "For this thing I besought the Lord thrice:"
and yet since it did not please God to remove it, he says "Wherefore I take
pleasure in infirmities, in insults, in persecutions." But perhaps what I
have said is not quite clear: therefore I will make it clearer. Paul incurred
many dangers and prayed that he might not be exposed to them. Then he
heard Christ saying "my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is
made perfect in weakness." As soon then as he saw what the will of God
was, he in future submitted his will to God's will. By means of this prayer
then Christ taught both these truths, that we should not plunge into
dangers, but rather pray that we may not fall into them; but if they come
upon us we should bear them bravely, and postpone our own will to the
will of God. Knowing these things then let us pray that we may never
enter into temptation: but if we do enter it let us beseech God to give us
patience and courage, and let us honor His will in preference to every will
of our own. For then we shall pass through this present life with safety,
and shall obtain the blessings to come: which may we all receive by the
favor and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom be to the
Father, together with the Holy Ghost, glory, might, honor, now and for
ever world without end. Amen.

HOMILY ON THE PARALYTIC
LET DOWN THROUGH THE ROOF

1. HAVING lately come across the incident of the paralytic who lay upon
his bed beside the pool, we discovered a rich and large treasure, not by
delving in the ground, but by diving into his heart: we found a treasure not
containing silver and gold and precious stones, but endurance, and
philosophy, and patience and much hope towards God, which is more
valuable than any kind of jewel or source of wealth. For material riches are
liable to the designs of robbers, and the tales of false accusers, and the
violence of housebreakers, and the villainy of servants, and when they
have escaped all these things, they often bring the greatest ruin upon those
who possess them by exciting the eyes of the envious, and consequently
breeding countless storms of trouble. But the spiritual riches escape all
these occasions of mischief and are superior to all abuse of this kind,
laughing to scorn both robbers, and housebreakers, and slanderers, and
false accusers and death itself. For they are not parted from the possessor
by death, but on the contrary the possession becomes then more
especially secured to the owners, and they accompany them on their
journey to the other world, and are transplanted with them to the future
life, and become marvelous advocates of those with whom they depart
hence, and render the judge propitious to them.

This wealth we found in great abundance stored in the soul of the
paralytic. And you are witnesses who with great zeal drew up draughts of
this treasure yet without exhausting it. For such is the nature of spiritual
wealth; it resembles fountains of water, or rather exceeds their
plenteousness, being most abundant when it has many to draw upon it.
For when it enters into any man's soul it is not divided, not diminished,
but coming in its entireness to each remains continually unconsumed, being
incapable of ever failing: which was just what took place at that time. For
although so many have applied to the treasure, and all are drawing upon it
as much as they can - but why do I speak of you, seeing that it has made
countless persons rich from that time to the present day, and yet abides in
its original perfection? Let us not then grow weary in having recourse to
this source of spiritual wealth: but as far as possible let us now also draw

forth draughts from it, and let us gaze upon our merciful Lord, gaze upon
His patient servant. He had been thirty and eight years struggling with an
incurable infirmity and was perpetually plagued by it, yet he did not
repine, he did not utter a blasphemous word, he did not accuse his Maker,
but endured his calamity bravely and with much meekness. And whence is
this manifest? you say: for Scripture has not told us anything clearly
concerning his former life, but only that he had been thirty-eight years in
his infirmity; it has not added a word to prove that he did not show
discontent, or anger or petulance. And yet it has made this plain also, if
any one will pay careful attention to it, not looking at it curiously and
carelessly. For when you hear that on the approach of Christ who was a
stranger to him, and regarded merely as a man, he spoke to him with such
great meekness, you may be able to perceive his former wisdom. For when
Jesus said to him "Wilt thou be made whole?" he did not make the natural
reply "thou seest me who have been this long time lying sick of the palsy,
and dost thou ask me if I wish to be made whole? hast thou come to insult
my distress, to reproach me and laugh me to scorn and make a mock of my
calamity? He did not say or conceive anything of this kind but meekly
replied "Yea Lord." Now if after thirty-eight; years he was thus meek and
gentle, when all the vigor and strength of his reasoning faculties was
broken down, consider what he is likely to have been at the outset of his
trouble. For be assured that invalids are not so hard to please at the
beginning of their disorder, as they are after a long lapse of time: they
become most intractable, most intolerable to all, when the malady is
prolonged. But as he, after so many years, was so wise, and replied with
so much forbearance, it is quite clear that during the previous time also he
had been bearing that calamity with much thankfulness.

Considering these things then let us imitate the patience of our
fellow-servant: for his paralysis is sufficient to brace up our souls: for no
one can be so supine and indolent after having observed the magnitude of
that calamity as not to endure bravely all evils which may befall him, even
if they are more intolerable than all that were ever known. For not only his
soundness but also his sickness has become a cause of the greatest benefit
to us: for his cure has stimulated the souls of the hearers to speak the
praise of the Lord, and his sickness and infirmity has encouraged you to
patience, and urged you to match his zeal; or rather it has exhibited to you

the lovingkindness of God. For the actual deliverance of the man. to such a
malady, and the protracted duration of his infirmity is a sign of the
greatest care for his welfare. For as a gold refiner having cast a piece of
gold into the furnace suffers it to be proved by the fire until such time as
he sees it has become purer: even so God permits the souls of men to be
tested by troubles until they become pure and transparent and have reaped
much profit from this process of sifting: wherefore this is the greatest
species of benefit.

2. Let us not then be disturbed, neither dismayed, when trials befall us.
For if the gold refiner sees how long he ought to leave the piece of gold in
the furnace, and when he ought to draw it out, and does not allow it to
remain in the fire until it is destroyed and burnt up: much more does God
understand this, and when He sees that we have become more pure, He
releases us from our trials so that we may not be overthrown and cast
down by the multiplication of our evils. Let us then not be repining, or
faint-hearted, when some unexpected thing befalls us; but let us suffer Him
who knows these things accurately, to prove our hearts by fire as long as
He pleases: for He does this for a useful purpose and with a view to the
profit of those who are tried.

On this account a certain wise man admonishes us saying "My Son, if
thou come to serve the Lord prepare thy soul for temptation, set thy heart
aright and constantly endure and make not haste in time of trouble"; "yield
to Him" he says, "in all things," for He knoweth exactly when it is right to
pluck us out of the furnace of evil. We ought therefore everywhere to yield
to Him and always to give thanks, and to bear all things contentedly,
whether He bestows benefits or chastisement upon us, for this also is a
species of benefit. For the physician, not only when he bathes and
nourishes the patient and conducts him into pleasant gardens, but also
when he uses cautery and the knife, is a physician all the same: and a
father not only when he caresses his son, but also when he expels him
from his house, and when he chides and scourges him, is a father all the
same, no less than when he praises him. Knowing therefore that God is
more tenderly loving than all physicians, do not enquire too curiously
concerning His treatment nor demand an account of it from Him, but
whether He is pleased to let us go free or whether He punishes, let us offer
ourselves for either alike; for He seeks by means of each to lead us back to

health, and to communion with Himself, and He knows our several needs,
and what is expedient for each one, and how and in what manner we ought
to be saved, and along that path He leads us. Let us then follow
whither-soever He bids us, and let us not too carefully consider whether
He commands us to go by a smooth and easy path, or by a difficult and
rugged one: as in the case of this paralytic. It was one species of benefit
indeed that his soul should be purged by the long duration of his suffering,
being delivered to the fiery trial of affliction as to a kind of furnace; but it
was another benefit no less than this that God was present with him in the
midst of the trials, and afforded him great consolation. He it was who
strengthened him, and upheld him, and stretched forth a hand to him, and
suffered him not to fall. But when you hear that it was God Himself do
not deprive the paralytic of his need of praise, neither him nor any other
man who is tried and yet steadfastly endures. For even if we be infinitely
wise, even if we are mightier and stronger than all men, yet in the absence
of His grace we shall not be able to withstand even the most ordinary
temptation. And why do I speak of such insignificant and abject beings as
we are? For even if one were a Paul, or a Peter, or a James, or a John, yet if
he should be deprived of the divine help he would easily be put to shame,
overthrown, and laid prostrate. And on behalf of these I will read you the
words of Christ Himself: for He saith to Peter "Behold Satan hath asked
to have you that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that
thy faith fail not." What is the meaning of "sift"? to turn and twist, and
shake and stir and shatter, and worry, which is what takes place in the
case of things which are winnowed: but I he says have restrained him,
knowing that you are not able to endure the trial, for the expression "that
thy faith fail not" is the utterance of one who signifies that if he had
permitted it his faith would have failed. Now if Peter who was such a
fervent lover of Christ and exposed his life for Him countless times and
sprang into the foremost rank in the Apostolic band, and was pronounced
blessed by his Master, and called Peter on this account because he kept a
firm and inflexible hold of the faith, would have been carried away and
fallen from profession if Christ had permitted the devil to try him as much
as he desired, what other man will be able to stand, apart from His help?
Therefore also Paul saith "But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to
be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation also make
the way of escape that ye may be able to bear it." For not only does He

say that He does not suffer a trial to be inflicted beyond our strength, but
even in that which is proportioned to our strength He is present carrying
us through it, and bracing us up, if only we ourselves first of all contribute
the means which are at our disposal, such as zeal, hope in Him,
thanksgiving, endurance, patience. For not only in the dangers which are
beyond our strength, but in those which are proportioned to it, we need
the divine assistance, if we are to make a brave stand; for elsewhere also it
is said "even as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort
also aboundeth through Christ, that we may be able to comfort those who
are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted
of God." So then he who comforted this man is the same who permitted
the trial to be inflicted upon him. And now observe after the cure what
tenderness He displays. For He did not leave him and depart, but having
found him in the temple he saith "behold! thou art made whole; sin no
more lest some worse thing happen unto thee." For had He permitted the
punishment because He hated him He would not have released him, He
would not have provided for his future safety: but the expression "lest
some worse thing happen unto thee" is the utterance of one who would
check coming evils beforehand. He put an end to the disease, but did not
put an end to the struggle: He expelled the infirmity but did not expel the
dread of it, so that the benefit which had been wrought might remain
unmoved. This is the part of a tender-hearted physician, not only to put
an end to present pains, but to provide for future security, which also
Christ did, bracing up his soul by the recollection of past events. For
seeing that when the things which distress us have departed, the
recollection of them oftentimes departs with them, He wishing it to abide
continually, saith "sin no more lest some worse thing happen unto thee."

3. Moreover it is possible to discern His forethought and consideration not
only from this, but also from that which seems to be a rebuke. For He did
not make a public exposure of his sins, but yet He told him that he
suffered what he did suffer on account of his sins, but what those sins
were He did not disclose; nor did He say "thou hast sinned" or "thou hast
transgressed," but He indicated the fact by one simple utterance "sin no
more;" and having said so much as just to remind him of it He put him
more on the alert against future events, and at the same time He made
manifest to us all his patience and courage and wisdom, having reduced

him to the necessity of publicly lamenting his calamity, and having
displayed his own earnestness on the man's behalf, "for while I am
coming," he says, "another steppeth down before me:" yet he did not
publicly expose his sins. For just as we ourselves desire to draw a veil
over our sins even so does God much more than we: on this account He
wrought the cure in the presence of all, but He gives the exhortation or the
advice privately. For He never makes a public display of our sins, except
at any time He sees men insensible to them. For when He says "ye saw
me hungry, and fed me not: and thirsty and gave me no drink," He speaks
thus at the present time in order that we may not hear these words in time
to come. He threatens, He exposes us in this world, that He may not have
to expose us in the other: even as He threatened to overthrow the city of
the Ninevites for the very reason that He might not overthrow it. For if He
wished to publish our sins He would not announce beforehand that He
would publish them: but as it is He does make this announcement in order
that being sobered by the fear of exposure, if not also by the fear of
punishment we may purge ourselves from them all. This also is what takes
place in the case of baptism: for He conducts the man to the pool of water
without disclosing his sins to any one; yet He publicly presents the boon
and makes it manifest to all, while the sins of the man are known to no one
save God Himself and him who receives the forgiveness of them. This also
was what took place in the case of this paralytic, He makes the reproof
without the presence of witnesses, or rather the utterance is not merely a
reproof but also a justification; He justifies Himself as it were for
evil-entreating him so long, telling him and proving to him that it was not
without cause and purpose that He had suffered him to be so long
afflicted, for He reminded him of his sins, and declared the cause of his
infirmity. "For having found him," we read, "in the temple, He said unto
him, sin no more lest some worse thing happen unto thee."

And now since we have derived so much profit from the account of the
former paralytic let us turn to the other who is presented to us in St.
Matthew's Gospel. For in the case of mines where any one happens to
find a piece of gold he makes a further excavation again in the same place:
and I know that many of those who read without care imagine that one and
the same paralytic is presented by the four evangelists: but it is not so.
Therefore you must be on the alert, and pay careful attention to the

matter. For the question is not concerned with ordinary matters, and this
discourse when it has received its proper solution will be serviceable
against both Greeks and Jews and many of the heretics. For thus all find
fault with the evangelists as being at strife and variance: yet this is not the
fact, Heaven forbid! but although the, outward appearance is different, the
grace of the Spirit which works upon the soul of each is one, and where
the grace of the Spirit is, there is love, joy, and peace; and there war and
disputation, strife and contention are not. How then shall we make it clear
that this paralytic is not the same as the other, but a different man? By
many tokens, both of place and time, and season, and day, and from the
manner of the cure, and the coming of the physician and the loneliness of
the man who was healed. And what of this? some one will say: for have
not many of the evangelists given diverse accounts of other signs? Yes, but
it is one thing to make statements which are diverse, and another,
statements which are contradictory; for the former causes no discord or
strife: but that which is now presented to us is a strong case of
contradiction unless it be proved that the paralytic at the pool was a
different man from him who is described by the other three evangelists.
Now that you may understand what is the difference between statements
which are diverse and contradictory, one of the evangelists has stated that
Christ carried the cross, another that Simon the Cyrenian carried it: but
this causes no contradiction or strife. "And how," you say, "is there no
contradiction between the statements that he carried and did not carry?"
Because both took place. When they went out of the Praetorium Christ
was carrying it: but as they proceeded Simon took it from Him and bore it.
Again in the case of the robbers, one says that the two blasphemed:
another that one of them checked him who was reviling the Lord. Yet in
this again there is no contradiction: because here also both things took
place, and at the beginning both the men behaved ill: but afterwards when
signs occurred, when the earth shook and the rocks were rent, and the sun
was darkened, one of them was converted, and became more chastened,
and recognized the crucified one and acknowledged his kingdom. For to
prevent your supposing that this took place by some constraining force of
one impelling him from within, and to remove your perplexity, he exhibits
the man to you on the cross while he is still retaining his former
wickedness in order that you may perceive that his conversion was

effected from within and out of his own heart assisted by the grace of God
and so he became a better man.

4. And it is possible to collect many other instances of this kind from the
Gospels, which seem to have a suspicion of contradiction, where there is
no real contradiction, the truth being that some incidents have been related
by this writer, others by that; or if not occurring at the same hour one
author has related the earlier event another the later; but in the present case
there is nothing of this kind, but the multitude of the evidences which I
have mentioned proves to those who pay any attention whatever to the
matter, that the paralytic was not the same man in both instances. And
this would be no slight proof to demonstrate that the evangelists were in
harmony with each other and not at variance. For if it were the same man
the discord is great between the two accounts: but if it be a different one
all material for dispute has been destroyed.

Well then let me now state the actual reasons why I affirm that this man is
not the same as that. What are they? The one is cured in Jerusalem, the
other in Capernaum; the one by the pool of water, the other in some
house; there is the evidence from place: the former during the festival:
there is the evidence from the special season: the former had been thirty
and eight years suffering from infirmity: concerning the other the
evangelist relates nothing of that kind: there is the evidence from time: the
former was cured on the Sabbath: there is the evidence from the day: for
had this man also been cured on the Sabbath Matthew would not have
passed by the fact in silence nor would the Jews who were present have
held their peace: for they who found fault for some other reason even
when a man was not cured on the Sabbath would have been yet more
violent in their accusation against Christ if they had got an additional
handle from the argument of the special day. Moreover this man was
brought to Christ: to the other Christ Himself came, and there was no man
to assist him. "Lord," said he," I have no man: "whereas this man had
many who came to his aid, who also let him down through the roof. And
He healed the body of the other man before his soul: for after he had cured
the paralysis He then said "Behold thou art made whole, sin no more:" but
not so in this case, but after He had healed his soul, for He said to him
"Son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee," He then cured his
paralysis. That this man then is not the same as the other has been clearly

demonstrated by these proofs, but it now remains for us to turn to the
beginning of the narrative and see how Christ cured the one and the other,
and why differently in each case: why the one on the Sabbath and the
other not on the Sabbath, why He came Himself to the one but waited for
the other to be brought to Him, why He healed the body of the one and
the soul of the other first. For He does not these things without
consideration and purpose seeing that He is wise and prudent. Let us then
give our attention and observe Him as He performs the cure. For if in the
case of physicians when they use the knife or cautery or operate in any
other way upon a maimed and crippled patient, and cut off a limb, many
persons crowd round the invalid and the physician who is doing these
things, much more ought we to act thus in this case, in proportion as the
physician is greater and the malady more severe, being one which cannot
be corrected by human art, but only by divine grace. And in the former
case we have to see the skin being cut, and matter discharging, and gore set
in motion, and to endure much discomfort produced by the spectacle, and
great pain and sorrow not merely from the sight of the wounds, but also
from the suffering undergone by those who are subjected to this burning or
cutting: for no one is so stony-hearted as to stand by those who are
suffering these things, and hear them shrieking, without being himself
overcome and agitated, and experiencing much depression of spirit; but yet
we undergo all this owing to our desire to witness the operation. But in
this case nothing of that kind has to be seen, no application of fire, no
plunging in of an instrument, no flowing of blood, no pain or shrieking of
the patient; and the reason of this is, the wisdom of the healer, which
needs none of these external aids, but is absolutely self-sufficient. For it is
enough that He merely utters a command and all distress ceases. And the
wonder is not only that He effects the cure with so much ease, but also
without pain, causing no trouble to those who are being healed.

Seeing then that the marvel is greater and the cure more important, and the
pleasure afforded to the spectators unalloyed by any kind of sorrow, let
us now carefully contemplate Christ in the act of healing. "And He entered
into a boat and crossed over and came into His own city: and behold they
brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing
their faith said unto the sick. of the palsy "Son! be of good cheer: thy sins
are forgiven." Now they were inferior to the centurion in respect of their

faith, but superior to the impotent man by the pool. For the former neither
invited the physician nor brought the sick man to the physician; but
approached Him as God and said "Speak the word only and my servant
shall be healed." Now these men did not invite the physician to the house,
and so far they are on an equality with the centurion: but they brought the
sick man to the physician and so far they are inferior, because they did not
say "speak the word only." Yet they are far better than the man lying by
the pool. For he said "Lord I have no man when the water is troubled to
put me into the pool:" but these men knew that Christ had no need either
of water, or pool, or anything else of that kind: nevertheless Christ not
only released the servant of the centurion but the other two men also from
their maladies, and did not say: "because thou hast proffered a smaller
degree of faith the cure which thou receivest shall be in proportion;" but
He dismissed the man who displayed the greater faith with eulogy and
honor, saying "I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel." On the
man who exhibited less faith than this one he bestowed no praise yet He
did not deprive him of a cure, no! not even him who displayed no faith at
all. But just as physicians when curing the same disorder receive from
some person a hundred gold pieces, from others half, from others less and
from some nothing at all: even so Christ received from the centurion a large
and unspeakable degree of faith, but from this man less and from the other
not even an ordinary amount, and yet He healed them all. For what reason
then did He deem the man who made no deposit of faith worthy of the
benefit? Because his failure to exhibit faith was not owing to indolence, or
to insensibility of soul, but to ignorance of Christ and having never heard
any miracle in which He was concerned either small or great. On this
account therefore the man obtained indulgence: which in fact the evangelist
obscurely intimates when he says, "for he wist not who it was," but he
only recognized Him by sight when he lighted upon Him the second time.

5. There are indeed some who say that this man was healed merely
because they who brought him believed; but this is not the fact. For "when
He saw their faith" refers not merely to those who brought the man but
also to the man who was brought. Why so? "Is not one man healed," you
say, "because another has believed?" For my part I do not think so unless
owing to immaturity of age or excessive infirmity he is in some way
incapable of believing. How then was it you say that in the case of the

woman of Canaan the mother believed but the daughter was cured? and
how was it that the servant of the centurion who believed rose from the
bed of sickness and was preserved. Because the sick persons themselves
were not able to believe. Hear then what the woman of Canaan says: "My
daughter is grievously vexed with a devil and sometimes she falleth into
the water and sometimes into the fire:" now how could she believe whose
mind was darkened and possessed by a devil, and was never able to
control herself, not in her sound senses? As then in the case of the woman
of Canaan so also in the case of the centurion; his servant lay ill in the
house, not knowing Christ, himself, nor who He was. How then was he to
believe in one who was unknown to him, and of whom he had never yet
obtained any experience? But in the case before us we cannot say this: for
the paralytic believed. Whence is this manifest? From the very manner of
his approach to Christ. For do not attend simply to the statement that
they let the man down through the roof: but consider how great a matter it
is for a sick man to have the fortitude to undergo this. For you are surely
aware that invalids are so faint-hearted and difficult to please as often to
decline the treatment administered to them on their sick bed, and to prefer
bearing the pain which arises from their maladies to undergoing the
annoyance caused by the remedies. But this man had the fortitude to go
outside the house, and to be carried into the midst of the market place, and
to exhibit himself in the presence of a crowd. And it is the habit of sick
folk to die under their disorder rather than disclose their personal
calamities. This sick man however did not act thus, but when he saw that
the place of assembly was filled, the approaches blocked, the haven of
refuge obstructed, he submitted to be let down through the roof. So ready
in contrivance is desire, so rich in resource is love. "For he also that
seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." The man did
not say to his friends "What is the meaning of this? why make this ado?
why push on? Let us wait until the house is cleared and the assembly is
dissolved: the crowds will withdraw, we shall then be able to approach
him privately and confer about these matters. Why should you expose my
misfortunes in the midst of all the spectators, and let me down from the
roof-top, and behave in an unseemly manner?" That man said none of
these things either to himself or to his bearers, but regarded it as an honor
to have so many persons made witnesses of his cure. And not from this
circumstance only was it possible to discern his faith but also from the

actual words of Christ. For after he had been let down and presented
Christ said to him, "Son! be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee."
And when he heard these words he was not indignant, he did not
complain, he did not say to the physician "What mean you by this? I
came to be healed of one thing and you heal another. This is an excuse and
a pretense and a screen of incompetence. Do you forgive sins which are
invisible?" He neither spoke nor thought any of these things, but waited,
allowing the physician to adopt the method of healing which He desired.
For this reason also Christ did not go to him, but waited for him to come,
that He might exhibit his faith to all. For could He not have made the
entrance easy? But He did none of these things; in order that He might
exhibit the man's zeal and fervent faith to all. For as He went to the man
who had been suffering thirty and eight years because he had no one to aid
him, so did He wait for this man to come to him because he had many
friends that He might make his faith manifest by the man being brought to
Him, and inform us of the other man's loneliness by going to him, and
disclose the earnestness of the one and the patience of the other to all and
especially to those who were present. For some envious and
misanthropical Jews were accustomed to grudge the benefits done to their
neighbors and to find fault with His miracles, sometimes on account of the
special season, saying that He healed on the Sabbath day; sometimes on
account of the life of those to whom the benefit was done, saying "if this
man were a prophet He would have known who the woman was who
touched Him:" not knowing that it is the special mark of a physician to
associate with the infirm and to be constantly seen by the side of the sick,
not to avoid them, or hurry from their presence - which in fact was what
He expressly said to those murmurers; "They that are whole have no need
of a physician but they that are sick." Therefore in order to prevent their
making the same accusations again He proves first of all that they who
come to Him are deserving of a cure on account of the faith which they
exhibit. For this reason He exhibited the loneliness of one man, and the
fervent faith and zeal of the other: for this reason He healed the one on the
Sabbath, the other not on the Sabbath: in order that when you see them
accusing and rebuking Christ on another day you may understand that
they accused him on the former occasion also not because of their respect
for the law, but because they could not contain their own malice. But why
did He not first address Himself to the cure of the paralytic, but said,

"Son! be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee?" He did this very
wisely. For it is a habit with physicians to destroy the originating cause of
the malady before they remove the malady itself. Often for example when
the eyes are distressed by some evil humor and corrupt discharge, the
physician, abandoning any treatment of the disordered vision, turns his
attention to the head, where the root and origin of the infirmity is: even so
did Christ act: He represses first of all the source of the evil. For the
source and root and mother of all evil is the nature of sin. This it is which
enervates our bodies: this it is which brings on disease: therefore also on
this occasion He said, "Son! be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee."
And on the other He said, "Behold! thou art made whole, sin no more lest
some worse thing happen unto thee," intimating to both that these
maladies were the offspring of sin. And in the beginning and outset of the
word disease as the consequence of sin attacked the body of Cain. For
after the murder of his brother, after that act of wickedness, his body was
subject to palsy. For trembling is the same thing as palsy. For when the
strength which regulates a living creature becomes weakened, being no
longer able to support all the limbs, it deprives them of their natural power
of direction, and then having become unstrung they tremble and turn
giddy.

6. Paul also demonstrated this: for when he was reproaching the
Corinthians with a certain sin he said, "For this cause many are weak and
sickly among you." Therefore also Christ first removes the cause of the
evil, and having said "Son! be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee,"
He uplifts the spirit and rouses the downcast soul: for the speech became
an efficient cause and having entered into the conscience it laid hold of the
soul itself and cast out of it all distress. For nothing creates pleasure and
affords confidence so much as freedom from self-reproach. For read was
the case with Lazarus, that he received his evil things in full, and
thereupon was comforted: and again in another place we read, "Comfort
ye my people say ye to the heart of Jerusalem, that she hath received of
the Lord's hand double for her sins." And again the prophet says "O Lord
give us peace, for thou hast requited all things to us," indicating that
penalties and punishments work forgiveness of sins; and this we might
prove from many passages. It seems to me then that the reason why He
said nothing to that man about remission of sins, but only secured him

against the future, was because the penalty for his sins had been already
worked out by the long duration of his sickness: or if this was not the
reason, it was because he had not yet attained any high degree of belief
concerning Christ that the Lord first addressed Himself to the lesser need,
and one which was manifest and obvious, the health of the body; but in
the case of the other man He did not act thus, but inasmuch as this man
had more faith, and a loftier soul, He spoke to him first of all concerning
the more dangerous disease: with the additional object of exhibiting his
equality of rank with the Father. For just as in the former case He healed
on the Sabbath day because He wished to lead men away from the Jewish
mode of observing it, and to take occasion from their reproaches to prove
Himself equal with the Father: even so in this instance also, knowing
beforehand what they were going to say, He uttered these words that He
might use them as a starting-point and a pretext for proving His equality
of rank with the Father. For it is one thing when no one brings an
accusation or charge to enter spontaneously upon a discourse about these
things, and quite another when other persons give occasion for it, to set
about the same work in the order and shape of a defense. For the nature of
the former demonstration was a stumbling block to the hearers: but the
other was less offensive, and more acceptable, and everywhere we see Him
doing this, and manifesting His equality not so much by words as by
deeds. This at any rate is what the Evangelist implied when he said that
the Jews persecuted Jesus not only because He broke the Sabbath but also
because He said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God,
which is a far greater thing, for He effected this by the demonstration of
His deeds. How then do the envious and wicked act, and those who seek
to find a handle in every direction? "Why does this man blaspheme?" they
say for "no man can forgive sins save God alone." As they persecuted
Him there because He broke the Sabbath, and took occasion from their
reproaches to declare His equality with the Father in the form of a defense,
saying "my Father worketh hitherto and I work," so here also starting
from the accusations which they make He proves from these His exact
likeness to the Father. For what was it they said? "No man can forgive
sins save God alone." Inasmuch then as they themselves laid down this
definition, they themselves introduced the rule, they themselves declared
the law, He proceeds to entangle them by means of their own words. "You
have confessed," He says, "that forgiveness of sins is an attribute of God

alone: my equality therefore is unquestionable." And it is not these men
only who declare this but also the prophet thus saying: "who is God as
thou?" and then, indicating His special attribute he adds "taking away
iniquity and passing over unrighteousness." If then any one else appears
thus doing the same thing He also is God, God even as that one is God.
But let us observe how Christ argues with them, how meekly and gently,
and with all tenderness. "And behold some of the scribes said within
themselves: this man blasphemeth." They did not utter the word, they did
not proclaim it through the tongue, but reasoned in the secret recesses of
their heart. How then did Christ act? He made public their secret thoughts
before the demonstration which was concerned with the cure of the
paralytic's body, wishing to prove to them the power of His Godhead.
For that it is an attribute of God alone, a sign of His deity to shew the
secrets of His mind, the Scripture saith "Thou alone knowest men's
hearts." Seest thou that this word "alone," is not used with a view of
contrasting the Son with the Father. For if the Father alone knows the
heart, how does the Son know the secrets of the mind? "For He Himself"
it is said, "knew what was in man "; and Paul when proving that the
knowledge of secret things is a special attribute of God says, "and He that
searchest the heart," shewing that this expression is equivalent to the
appellation "God." For just as when I say "He who causeth rain said," I
signify none other than God by mentioning the deed, since it is one which
belongs to Him alone: and when I say "He who maketh the sun to rise,"
without adding the word God, I yet signify Him by mentioning the deed:
even so when Paul said "He who searcheth the hearts," he proved that to
search the heart is an attribute of God alone. For if this expression had not
been of equal force with the name "God" for pointing out Him who was
signified, he would not have used it absolutely and by itself. For if the
power were shared by Him in common with some created being, we
should not have known who was signified, the community of power
causing confusion in the mind of the hearers. Inasmuch then as this
appears to be a special attribute of the Father, and yet is manifested of the
Son whose equality becomes thence unquestionable, therefore we read
"why think ye evil in your hearts? for whether is easier: to say: Thy sins
are forgiven thee or to say arise and walk?"

7. See moreover He makes a second proof of His power of forgiving sins.
For to forgive sins is a very much greater act than to heal the body, greater
in proportion as the soul is greater than the body. For as paralysis is a
disease of the body, even so sin is a disease of the soul: but although this
is the greater it is not palpable: whereas the other although it be less is
manifest. Since then He is about to use the less for a demonstration of the
greater proving that He acted thus on account of their weakness, and by
way of condescension to their feeble condition He says "whether is easier?
to say thy sins are forgiven thee or to say arise and walk?" For what
reason then should He address Himself to the lesser act on their account?
Because that which is manifest presents the proof in a more distinct form.
Therefore He did not enable the man to rise until He had said to them "But
that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,
(then saith He to the sick of the palsy) arise and walk:" as if He had said:
forgiveness of sins is indeed a greater sign: but for your sakes I add the less
also since this seems to you to be a proof of the other. For as in another
case when He praised the centurion for saying "speak the word only and
my servant shall be healed: for I also say to this man go and he goeth and
to the other come and he cometh" He confirmed promising that which
belongs only to the Father," He having upbraided and accused them and
proved by His deeds that He did not blaspheme supplied us with
indisputable evidence that He could do the same things as the Father who
begat Him Observe at least the manner in which He pleases to establish
the fact that what belongs to the Father only, belongs also to Himself: for
He did not simply enable the parlytic to get up, but also said "but that ye
may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins:" thus
it was his endeavor and earnest desire to prove above all things that He
had the same authority as the Father.

8. Let us then carefully hold fast all these things, both those which were
spoken yesterday and the day before that, and let us beseech God that
they may abide immovably in our heart, and let us contribute zeal on our
side, and constantly meet in this place. For in this way we shall preserve
the truths which have been formerly spoken, and we shall add others to
our store; and if any of them slip from our memory through the lapse of
time we shall easily be able to recover them by the aid of continual
teaching. And not only will the doctrines abide sound and uncorrupt but

our course of life will have the benefit of much diligent care and we shall be
able to pass through this present state of existence with pleasure and
cheerfulness. For whatever kind of suffering is oppressing our soul when
we come here will easily be got rid of: seeing that now also Christ is
present, and he who approaches Him with faith will readily receive healing
from Him. Suppose some one is struggling with perpetual poverty, and at
a loss for necessary food, and often goes to bed hungry, if he has come in
here, and heard Paul saying that he passed his time in hunger and thirst and
nakedness, and that he experienced this not on one or two or three days,
but constantly (this at least is what he indicates when he says "up to the
present hour we both dear to Him: but He permitted it out of His Paul
who was continually suffering from disorders, and never had any respite
from prolonged infirmity, even as Paul also said "Use a little wine for thy
stomach's sake and thine often infirmities," where he does not speak
merely of infirmities as such. Or another having been subjected to false
accusation has acquired a bad reputation with the public, and this is
continually vexing and gnawing his soul: he enters this place and hears
"Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you and say all manner of evil
against you falsely: rejoice ye and be exceeding glad for great is your
reward in Heaven:" then he will lay aside all despondency and receive
every kind of pleasure: for it is written "leap for joy, and be exceeding glad
when men cast out your name as evil." In this manner then God comforts
those that are evil spoken of, and them that speak evil He puts in fear after
another manner saying "every evil word which men shall speak they shall
give an account thereof whether it be good or evil"

Another perhaps has lost a little daughter or a son, or one of his kinsfolk,
and he also having come here listens to Paul groaning over this present fife
and longing to see that which is to come, and oppressed by his sojourn in
this world, and he will go away with a sufficient remedy for his grief when
he has heard him say "Now concerning them that are asleep I would not
have you ignorant brethren that ye sorrow not even as others who have no
hope." He did not say concerning the dying," but "concerning them that
are asleep" proving that death is a sleep. As then if we see any one
sleeping we are not disturbed or distressed, expecting that he will certainly
get up: even so when we see any one dead, let us not be disturbed or
dejected for this also is a sleep, a longer one indeed, but still a sleep. By

giving it the name of slumber He comforted the mourners and overthrew
the accusation of the unbelievers. If you mourn immoderately over him
who has departed you will be like that unbeliever who has no hope of a
resurrection. He indeed does well to mourn, inasmuch as he cannot exercise
any spiritual wisdom concerning things to come: but thou who hast
received such strong proofs concerning the future life, why dost thou sink
into the same weakness with him? Therefore it is written "now concerning
them that are asleep we would not have you ignorant that ye sorrow not
even as others who have no hope."

And not only from the New Testament but from the Old also it is possible
to receive abundant consolation. For when you hear of Job after the loss of
his property, after the destruction of his herds, after the loss not of one, or
two, or three, but of a whole troop of sons in the very flower of their age,
after the great excellence of soul which he displayed, even if thou art the
weakest of men, thou wilt easily be able to repent and regain thy courage.
For thou, O man, hast constantly attended thy sick son, and hast seen him
laid upon the bed, and hast heard him uttering his last words, and stood
beside him whilst he was drawing his last breath and hast dosed his eyes,
and shut his mouth: but he was not did not see them breathing their last
gasp, but the house became the common grave of them all, and on the same
table brains and blood were poured forth, and pieces of wood and tiles,
and dust, and fragments of flesh, and all these things were mingled together
in like manner. Nevertheless after such great calamities of this kind he was
not petulant, but what does he say - "The Lord gave, the Lord hath
taken away; as it seemed good unto the Lord even so has it come to pass,
blessed be the name of the Lord for ever." Let this speech be our utterance
also over each event which befalls us; whether it be loss of property, or
infirmity of body, or insult, or false accusation or any other form of evil
incident to mankind, let us say these words "The Lord gave, the Lord hath
taken away; as it seemed good to the Lord so has it come to pass; blessed
be the name of the Lord for ever." If we practice this spiritual wisdom, we
shall never experience any evil, even if we undergo countess sufferings, but
the gain will be greater than the loss, the good will exceed the evil: by these
words thou wilt cause God to be merciful unto thee, and wilt defend
thyself against the tyranny of Satan. For as soon as thy tongue has uttered
these words forthwith the Devil hastens from thee: and when he has

hastened away, the cloud of dejection also is dispelled and the thoughts
which afflict us take to flight, hurrying off in company with him, and in
addition to all this thou wilt win all manner of blessings both here and in
Heaven. And you have a convincing example in the case of Job, and of the
Apostle, who having for God's sake despised the troubles of this world,
obtained the everlasting blessings. Let us then be trustful and in all things
which befall us let us rejoice and give thanks to the merciful God, that we
may pass through this present life with serenity, and obtain the blessings
to come, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ to
whom be glory, honor and might always, now and ever, world without
end. Amen.

1. I DID no good as it seems by the prolonged discourse which I lately
addressed to destitute of her children. Wherefore also I am again compelled
to seem vexatious and burdensome, reproving those who are present, and
finding fault with those who have been left behind: with them because
they have not put away their sloth,, and with you because you have not
given a helping hand to the salvation of your brethren. I am compelled to
seem burdensome and vexatious, not on behalf of myself, or my own
possessions, but on your behalf and for your salvation, which is more
precious to me than anything else. Let him who pleases take it in bad part,
and call me insolent and impudent, yet will I not cease continually
annoying him for the same purpose; for nothing is better for me than this
kind of impudence. For it may be, it may be, that this is at least if nothing
else, will put you to shame, and that to avoid being perpetually
importuned concerning the same things, ye will take part in the tender care
of your brethren. For what profit is there to me in praise when I do not
see you making advances in virtue? and what harm is there from the silence
of the hearers when I behold your piety increasing? For the praise of the
speaker does not consist in applause, but in the zeal of the hearers for
godliness: not in noise made just at the time of hearing, but in lasting
earnestness. As soon as applause has issued from the lips it is dispersed in
air and perishes; but the moral improvement of the hearers brings an
imperishable and immortal reward both to him who speaks and to them
who obey. The praise of your cheers makes the speaker illustrious here,
but the piety of your soul affords the teacher much confidence before the
judgment-seat of Christ. Wherefore if any one loves the speaker, let him
not desire the applause but the profit of the hearers. To one which brings
extreme punishment, and an turn out a bad man, since he restored it intact:
nevertheless he did turn out a bad man as regarded his management of the
deposit. For he did not double that which was entrusted to him; and so

was punished. Whence it is manifest that even if we are earnest and well
trained, and have much zeal about hearing the holy scriptures this does not
suffice for our salvation. For the deposit must be doubled, and it becomes
doubled when together with our own salvation we undertake to make some
provision for the good of others. For the man in the parable said "Lo!
there thou hast that is thine:" but this did not serve him for a defense: for
it was said to him "thou oughtest to have put the money to the
exchangers"

And observe I pray how easy the commands of the Master are: for men
indeed make those who lend out capital sums at interest answerable for
recalling them; "you have made the deposit," one says, "you must call it
in: I have no concern with the man who has received it." But God does not
act thus; He only commands us to make the deposit, and does not render
us liable for the recall. For the speaker has the power of advising, not of
persuading. Therefore he says: "I make thee answerable for depositing
only, and not for the recall." What can be easier than this? And yet the
servant called the master hard, who was thus gentle and merciful. For such
is the wont of the ungrateful and indolent; they always try to shift the
blame of their offenses from themselves to their master. And therefore the
man was thrust out with torture and bonds into the outer darkness And
lest we should suffer this penalty let us deposit our teaching with the
brethren, whether they be persuaded by it, or not. For if they be
persuaded they will profit both themselves and us: and if they are not,
they involve themselves indeed in inevitable punishment, but will not be
able to do us the slightest injury. For we have done our part, by giving
them advice: but if they do not listen to it no harm will result to us from
that. For blame would attach to us not for failing to persuade, but for
failing to advise: and after prolonged and continual exhortation and counsel
they and not we, have to reckon henceforth with God.

I have been anxious at any rate to know clearly, whether you continue to
exhort your brethren, and if they remain all the time in the same condition
of indolence: otherwise I would never have given you any trouble: as it is,
I have fears that they may remain uncorrected in consequence of your
neglect and indifference. For it is impossible that a man who continually
has the benefit of exhortation and instruction should not become better and
more diligent. The proverb which I am about to cite is certainly a common

one, nevertheless it confirms this very truth. For "a perpetual dropping of
water" it says, "wears a rock," yet what is softer than water? and what is
harder than a rock? Nevertheless perpetual action conquers nature: and if it
conquers nature much more will it be able to prevail over the human will.
Christianity is no child's play, my beloved: no matter of secondary
importance. I am continually saying these things, and yet I effect nothing.

2. How am I distressed, think you, when I call to mind that on the festival
days the multitudes assembled resemble the broad expanse of the sea, but
now not even the smallest part of that multitude is gathered together here?
Where are they now who oppress us with their presence on the feast
days? I look for them, and am grieved on their account when I mark what a
multitude are perishing of those who are in the way of salvation, how large
a loss of brethren I sustain, how few are reached by the things which
concern salvation, and how the greater part of the body of the Church is
Eke a dead and motionless carcass. "And what concern is that to us?" you
say. The greatest possible concern if you pay no attention to your
brethren, if you do not exhort and advise, if you put no constraint on
them, and do not forcibly drag them hither, and lead them away out of
their deep indolence. For that one ought not to be useful to himself alone,
but also to many others, Christ declared mayest enjoy the light by thyself,
but that thou mayest bring back yonder man who has gone astray. For
what profit is a lamp if it does not give light to him who sits in darkness?
and what profit is a Christian when he benefits no one, neither leads any
one back to virtue? Again salt is not an astringent to itself but braces up
those parts of the body which have decayed, and prevents them from
falling to pieces and perishing. Even so do thou, since God has appointed
thee to be spiritual salt, bind and brace up the decayed members, that is
the indolent and sordid brethren, and having rescued them from their
indolence as from some form of corruption, unite them to the rest of the
body of the Church. And this is the reason why He called you leaven: for
leaven also does not leaven itself, but, little though it is, it affects the
whole lump however big it may be. So also do ye: although ye are few in
number, yet be ye many and powerful in faith, and in zeal towards God.
As then the leaven is not weak on account of its littleness, but prevails
owing to its inherent heat, and the force of its natural quality so ye also
will be able to bring back a far larger number than yourselves, if you will,

to the same degree of zeal as your own. Now if they make the summer
season their excuse: for I hear of their saying things of this kind, "the
present stifling heat is excessive, the scorching sun is intolerable, we
cannot bear being trampled and crushed in the crowd, and to be steaming
all over with perspiration and oppressed by the heat and confined space:"
I am ashamed of them, believe me: for such excuses are womanish: indeed
even in their case who have softer bodies, and a weaker nature, such
pretexts do not suffice for justification. Nevertheless, even if it seems a
disgrace to make a reply to a defense of this kind, yet is it necessary. For
if they put forward such excuses as these and do not blush, much more
does it behoove us not to be ashamed of replying to these things. What
then am I to say to those who advance these pretexts? I would remind
them of the three children in the furnace and the flame, who when they
saw the fire encircling them on all sides, enveloping their mouth and their
eyes and even their breath, did not cease singing that sacred and mystical
hymn to God, in company with the universe, but standing in cheerfulness
than they who abide in some flowery field: and together with these three
children I should think it proper to remind them also of the lions which
were in Babylon, and of Daniel and the den: and not of this one only but
also of another den, and the prophet Jeremiah, and the mire in which he
was smothered up to the neck. And emerging from these dens, I would
conduct these per sons who put forward heat as an excuse into the prison
and exhibit Paul to them there, and Silas bound fast in the stocks, covered
with bruises and wounds lacerated all over their body with a mass of
stripes, yet singing praises to God at midnight and celebrating their holy
fire, and the den, and amongst wild beasts, and mire, and in a prison and
the stocks and amidst stripes and gaolers, and intolerable sufferings, never
complained of any of these things but were continually uttering prayers
and sacred songs with much energy and fervent zeal, whilst we who have
not undergone any of their innumerable sufferings small or great, neglect
our own salvation on account of a scorching sun and a tittle short lived
heat and toil, and forsaking the assembly wander away, depraving
ourselves by going to meetings which are thoroughly unwholesome? When
the dew of the divine oracles is so abundant dost thou make heat thy
excuse? "The water which I will give him," saith Christ "shall be in him a
well of water springing up into everlasting life;" and again; "He that
believeth on me as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers

of living water" Tell me; when thou hast spiritual wets and rivers art thou
afraid of material heat? Now in the market place where there is so much
turmoil and crowding, and scorching wind, how is it that you do not make
suffocation and heat an excuse for absenting yourself? For it is impossible
for you to say that there you can enjoy a cooler temperature, and that all
the heat is concentrated here with us: - the truth is exactly the reverse;
here indeed owing to the pavement floor, and to the construction of the
building in other respects (for it is carried up to a vast height), the air is
lighter and cooler: whereas there the sun is strong in every direction, and
there is much crowding, and vapor and dust, and other things which add to
discomfort far more than these. Whence it is plain that these senseless
excuses are the offspring of indolence and of a supine disposition,
destitute of the fire of the Holy Spirit.

3. Now these remarks of mine are not so much directed to them, as to you
who do not bring them forward, do not rouse them from their indolence,
and draw them to this table of salvation. Household slaves indeed when
they have to discharge some service in common, summon their fellow
slaves, but you when of the advantage by your neglect. "But what if they
do not desire it?" you say. Make them desire it by your continual
importunity: for if they see you insisting upon it they certainly will desire
it. Nay these things are a mere excuse and pretense. How many fathers at
any rate are there here who have not their sons standing with them? Was it
so difficult for thee to bring hither some of thy children? Whence it is dear
that the absence of all the others who remain outside is due not only to
their own indolence, but also to your neglect. But now at leash if never
before, rouse yourselves up, and let each person enter the Church
accompanied by a member of his family: let them incite and urge one
another to the assembly here, the father his son, the son his father, the
husbands their wives and the wives their husbands the master his slave,
brother his brother, friend his friend: or rather let us not summon friends
only but also enemies to this common treasury of good things. If thy
enemy sees thy care for his welfare, he will undoubtedly relinquish his
hatred.

Say to him: "art thou not ashamed and dost thou not blush before the
Jews who keep their Sabbath with such great strictness, and from the
evening of it abstain from all work? And if they see the sun verging

towards setting on the day of the Preparation they break off business, and
cut short their traffic: and if any one who has been making a purchase from
them, before the evening, comes in the evening bringing the price, they do
not suffer themselves to take it, or to accept the money." And why do I
speak of the price of market wares and transaction of business? Even if it
were possible to receive a treasure they would rather lose the gain than
trample on their law. Are the Jews then so strict, and this when they keep
the law out of due season, and cling to an observance of it which does not
profit them, but rather does them harm: and wilt thou, who art superior to
the shadow, to whom it has been vouchsafed to see the Sun of
Righteousness, who art ranked as a citizen of the Heavenly
commonwealth, wilt thou not display the same zeal as those who
unseasonably cleave to what is wrong, thou who hast been entrusted with
the truth, but although thou art summoned here for only a short part of the
day, canst thou not endure to spend even this upon the hearing of the
divine oracles? and What kind of indulgence, pray, could you obtain? and
what answer will you have to make which is reasonable and just? It is
utterly impossible that one who is so indifferent and indolent should ever
obtain indulgence, even if he should allege the necessities of worldly affairs
ten thousand times over as an excuse. Do you not know that if you come
and worship God and take part in the work which goes on here. the
business you have on hand is made much easier for you? Have you
worldly anxieties? Come here on that account that by the time you spend
here you may win for yourself the favor of God, and so depart with a
sense of security; that you may have Him for your ally, that you may
become invincible to the demons because you are assisted by the heavenly
hand. If you have the benefit of prayers uttered by the fathers, if you take
part in common prayer, if you listen to the divine oracles, if you win for
yourself the aid of God, if, armed with these weapons, you then go forth,
not even the devil himself will be able henceforth to look you in the face,
much less wicked men who are eager to insult and malign you. But if you
go from your house to the market place, and are found destitute of these
weapons, you will be easily mastered by all who insult you. This is the
reason why both in public and private affairs, many things occur contrary
to our expectation, because we have not been diligent about spiritual things
in the first place, and secondarily about the secular, but have inverted the
order. For this reason also the proper sequence and right arrangement of

things has been upset, and all our affairs are full of much confusion. Can
you imagine what distress and grief I suffer when I observe, that if a public
holy day and festival is at hand there is a concourse of all the inhabitants
of the city, although there is no one to summon them; but when the holy
day and festival are past, even if we should crack our voice by continuing
to call over in my mind I have groaned heavily, and said to myself: What is
the use of exhortation or advice, when you do everything merely by the
force of habit, and do not become a whir more zealous in consequence of
my teaching? For whereas in the festivals you need no exhortation from
me, but, when they are past you profit nothing by my teaching, do you
not show that my discourse, so far as you are concerned, is superfluous?

4. Perhaps many of those who hear these things are grieved. But such is
not the sentiment of the indolent: else they would put away their
carelessness, like ourselves, who are daily anxious about your affairs. And
what gain do you make by your secular transactions in proportion to the
damage you sustain? It is impossible to depart from any other assembly,
or gathering, in the possession of so much gain as you receive from the
time spent here, whether it be the law court, or council-chamber, or even
the palace itself. For we do not commit the administration of nations or
cities nor the command of armies to those who enter here, but another kind
of government more dignified than that of the empire itself; or rather we do
not ourselves commit it, but the grace of the spirit.

What then is the government, more dignified than that of the empire,
which they who enter here receive? They are trained to master untoward
passions, to rule wicked lusts, to command anger, to regulate ill-will, to
subdue vainglory. The emperor, seated on the imperial throne, and wearing
his diadem, is not so dignified as the man who has elevated his own inward
right reason to the throne of government over base passions, and by his
dominion over them has bound as it were a glorious diadem upon his brow.
For what profit is there, pray, in purple, and raiment wrought with gold,
and a jeweled crown, when the soul is in captivity to the passions? What
gain is there in outward freedom when the ruling element within us is
reduced to a state of disgraceful and pitiable servitude. For just as when a
fever penetrates deep, and inflames all the inward parts, there is no benefit
to be got from the outward surface of the body, although it is not affected
in the same way: even so when our soul is violently carried away by the

passion within, no outward government, not even the imperial throne, is of
any profit, since reason is deposed from the throne of empire by the
violent usurpation of the passions, and bows and trembles beneath their
insurrectionary movements. Now to prevent this taking place prophets
and apostles concur on all sides in helping us, repressing our passions, and
expelling all the ferocity of the irrational element within us, and
committing a mode of government to us far more dignified than the empire.
This is why I said that they who deprive themselves of this care receive a
blow in the vital parts, sustaining greater damage than can be inflicted from
any other quarter inasmuch as they who come here get greater gain than
they could derive from any other source: even as Scripture has declared.
The law said "Thou shalt not appear before the Lord empty;" that is,
enter not into the temple without sacrifices. Now if it is not right to go
into the house of God without sacrifices, much more ought we to enter the
assembly accompanied by our brethren: for this sacrifice and offering is
better than that, when thou bringest a soul with thee into the Church. Do
you not see doves which have been trained, how they hunt for others
when they are let out? Let us also do this. For what kind of excuse shall
we have, if irrational creatures are able to hunt for an animal of their own
species, while we who have been honored with reason and so much
wisdom neglect this kind of pursuit? I exhorted you in my former
discourse with these words: "Go, each of you to the houses of your
neighbors, wait for them to come out, lay hold of them, and conduct them
to their common mother: and imitate those who are mad upon theater
going, who diligently arrange to meet each other and so wait at early dawn
to see that iniquitous spectacle." Yet I have not effected anything by this
exhortation. Therefore I speak again and shall not cease speaking, until I
have persuaded you. Hearing profits nothing unless it is accompanied by
practice. It makes our punishment heavier, if we continually hear the same
things and do none of the things which are spoken. That the chastisement
will be heavier, hear the they have no cloke for their sin." And the Apostle
says "for not the hearers of the law shall be justified." These things He
says to the hearers; but when He wishes to instruct the speaker also, that
even he will not gain anything from his teaching unless his behavior is in
close correspondence with his doctrine, and his manner of life is in
harmony with his speech, hear how the Apostle and the prophet address
themselves to him: for the latter says "but to the sinner said God, why

dost thou preach my laws and takest my covenant in thy mouth, whereas
thou hast hated instruction?" And the Apostle, addressing himself to these
same again who thought great things of their teaching, speaks on this wise:
"Thou art confident that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of
those who are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes:
thou therefore that teachest another teachest thou not thyself?" Inasmuch
then as it could neither profit me the speaker to speak, nor you the hearers
to hear, unless we comply with the things which are spoken, but rather
would increase our condemnation, let us not limit the display of our zeal
to hearing only, but let us observe what is said, in our deeds. For it is
indeed a good thing to spend time continually in hearing the divine oracles:
but this good thing becomes useless when the benefit to be derived from
hearing is not linked with it.

Therefore that you may not assemble here in vain I shall not cease
beseeching you with all earnestness, as I have often besought you before,
"conduct your brethren to us, exhort the wanderers, counsel them not by
word only but also by deed." This is the more powerful, teaching - that
which comes through our manners and behavior - Even if you do not
utter a word, but yet, after you have gone out of this assembly, by your
mien, and your look, and your voice and all the rest of your demeanor you
exhibit to the men who have been left behind the gain which you have
brought away with you, this is sufficient for exhortation and advice. For
we ought to go out from this place as it were from some sacred shrine, as
men who have descended from heaven itself, who have become sedate, and
philosophical, who do and say everything in proper measure: and when a
wife sees her husband returning from the assembly, and a father his son,
and a friend his friend, and an enemy his enemy, let them all receive and
they perceive that you have become milder more philosophical, more
devout. Consider what privileges you enjoy who hast been initiated into
the mysteries. with what company thou offerest up that mystic hymn,
with what company thou criest aloud the "Ter sanctus." art ranked as a
citizen of the commonwealth above, that thou hast been enrolled in the
choir of Angels, that thou hast conversed with the Lord, that thou hast
been in the company of Christ. If we regulate ourselves in this way we
shall not need to say anything, when we go out to those who are left
behind: but from our advantage they will perceive their own loss and will

hasten hither, so as to enjoy the same benefits themselves. For when,
merely by the use of their senses, they see the beauty of your soul shining
forth, even if they are the most stupid of men, they will become enamored
of your goodly appearance. For if corporeal beauty excites those who
behold it, much more will symmetry of soul be able to move the spectator,
and stimulate him to equal zeal. Let us then adorn our inward man, and let
us be mindful of the things which are said here. when we go out: for there
especially is it a proper time to remember them; and just as an athlete
displays in the lists the things which he has learned in the training school:
even so ought we to display in our transactions in the world without the
things which we have heard here.

5. Bear in mind then the things which are said here, that when you have
gone out and the devil lays hold of you either by means of anger or
vainglory, or any other passion, you may call to remembrance the teaching
which you have received here and may be able easily to shake off the grasp
of the evil one. Do you not see the wrestling-masters in the practicing
grounds, who, after countess contests having obtained exemption from
wrestling on account of their age, sit outside the lines by the side of the
dust and shout to those who are wrestling inside, telling one to grasp a
hand, or drag a leg, or seize upon the back, and by many other directions
of that kind, saying, "if you do so and so you will easily throw your
antagonist," they are of the greatest service to their pupils? Even so do
thou look to thy training master the blessed Paul, who after countless
victories is now sitting outside the boundary, I mean this present life, and
cries aloud to us who are wrestling, shouting out by means of his Epistles,
when he sees us overcome by wrath and resentment of injuries, and
choked by passion; "if thy enemy hunger feed him, if he thirst give him
drink;" - a beautiful precept full of spiritual wisdom, and serviceable
both to the doer and the receiver. But the reminder of the passage causes
much perplexity, and does not seem to correspond to the sentiment of him
who uttered the former words. And what is the nature of this? the saying
that "by so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head." For by these
words he does a wrong both to the doer and the receiver: to the latter by
setting his head on fire, and plating coals upon it; for what good will he get
from receiving food and drink in proportion to the evil he will suffer from
the heaping of coals on his head? Thus then the recipient of the benefit is

wronged, having a greater vengeance inflicted on him, but the benefactor
also is injured in another way. For what can he gain from doing good to his
enemies when he acts in the hope of revenge? For he who gives meat and
drink to his enemy for the purpose of heaping coals of fire on his head
would not become merciful and kind, but cruel and harsh, having inflicted
an enormous punishment by means of a small benefit. For what could be
more unkind than to feed a person for the purpose of heaping coals of fire
on his head? This then is the contradiction: and now it remains that the
solution should be added, in order that by those very things which seem to
do violence to the letter of the law you may dearly see all the wisdom of
the lawgiver. What then is the solution?

That great and noble-minded man was well aware of the fact that to be
reconciled quickly with an enemy is a grievous and difficult thing; grievous
and difficult, not on account of its own nature, but of our moral indolence.
But he commanded us not only to be reconciled with our enemy, but also
to feed him; which was far more grievous than the former. For if some are
infuriated by the mere sight of those who have annoyed them, how would
they be willing to feed them when they were hungry? And why do I speak
of the sight infuriating them? If any one makes mention of the persons,
and merely introduces their name in sorely, it revives the wound in our
imagination, and increases the heat of passion. Paul then being aware of all
these things and wishing to make what was hard and difficult of correction
smooth and easy, and to persuade one who could not endure to see his
enemy, to be ready to confer that benefit already mentioned upon him,
added the words about coals of fire, in order that a man prompted by the
hope of vengeance might hasten to do this service to one who had annoyed
him. And in order that one of them hastening to its accustomed food may
be captured by means of it and easily held fast: even so Paul also wishing
to lead on the man who has been wronged to below a benefit on the man
who has wronged him does not present to him the bare hook of spiritual
wisdom, but having covered it as it were with a kind of bait, I mean the
"coals of fire," invites the man who has been noyed him; but when he has
come he holds him fast in future, and does not let him make off, the very
nature of the deed attaching him to his enemy; and he all but says to him:
"if thou art not willing to feed the man who has wronged thee for piety's
sake: feed him at least from the hope of punishing him." For he knows that

if the man once sets his hand to the work of conferring this benefit, a
starting-point is made and a way of reconciliation is opened for him. For
certainly no one would have the heart to regard a man continually as his
enemy to whom he has given meat and drink, even if he originally does this
in the hope of vengeance. For time as it goes on relaxes the tension of his
anger. As then the fisherman, if he presented the bare hook would never
allure the fish, but when he has covered it gets it unawares into the mouth
of the creature who comes up to it: so also Paul if he had not advanced the
expectation of inflicting punishment would never have persuaded those
who were wronged to undertake to benefit those who had annoyed them.
Wishing then to persuade those who recoiled in disgust, and were
paralyzed by the very sight of their enemies, to confer the greatest
benefits upon them, he made mention of the coals of fire, not with a view
of thrusting the persons in question into inexorable punishment, but in
order that when he had persuaded those who were wronged to benefit their
enemies in the expectation of punishing them, he might afterwards in time
persuade them to abandon their anger altogether.

6. Thus then did he encourage the man who has been wronged; but observe
also how he unites again the man who has done the wrong to him who has
been provoked. First of all by the very manner of the benefit: (for there is
no one so degraded and unfeeling as to be unwilling, when he receives meat
and drink, to become the servant and friend of him who does this for him):
and in the second place through the dread of vengeance. For the passage,
"by so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head" seems indeed to be
addressed to the person who gives the food; but it more especially touches
him who has caused the annoyance, in order that through fear of this
punishment he may be deterred from remaining continually in a state of
enmity, and being aware that the reception of food and drink might do him
the greatest mischief if he constantly retains his animosity, may suppress
his anger. For thus he will be able to quench the coals of fire. Wherefore
the proposed punishment and vengeance both induces the one who has
been wronged to benefit him who has annoyed him, and it deters and
checks him who has given the provocation, and impels him to
reconciliation with the man who gives him meat and drink. Paul therefore
linked the two persons by a twofold bond, the one depending on a benefit,
the other on an act of vengeance. For the difficulty is to make a beginning

and to find an opening for the reconciliation: but when that has once been
reared in whatever way it may be, all which follows will be smooth and
easy. For even if at first the man who has been annoyed feeds his enemy
in the hope of punishing him, yet becoming his friend by the act of giving
him food he will be able to expel the desire of vengeance. For when he has
become a friend he will no longer feed the man who has been reconciled to
him, with an expectation of this kind. Again he who has given the
provocation, when he sees the man who has been wronged electing to give
him meat and drink, casts out all his animosity, both on account of this
deed, and also of his fear of the punishment which is in store for him, even
if he be excessively hard and harsh and stony hearted, being put to shame
by the benevolence of him who gives him food, and dreading the
punishment reserved for him, if he continues to be an enemy after
accepting the food.

For this reason Paul did not stop even here in his exhortation, but when he
has emptied each side of wrath he proceeds to correct their disposition,
saying, "be not overcome of evil" "For if," he says, "you continue to bear
resentment and to seek revenge you seem indeed to conquer your enemy,
but in reality you are being conquered by evil, that is, by wrath: so that if
you wish to conquer, be reconciled, and do not make an attack upon your
adversary;" for a brilliant victory is that in which by means of good, that is
to say by forbearance, you overcome evil expelling wrath and resentment.
But the injured man, when inflamed with passion would not have born
these words. Therefore when he had satisfied his wrath he proceeded to
conduct him to the best reason for reconciliation, and did not permit him
to remain permanently animated by the wicked hope of vengeance. Dost
thou perceive the wisdom of the lawgiver? And that you may learn that he
introduced this law only on account of the weakness of those who would
not otherwise be content to make terms amongst themselves, hear how
Christ, when He ordained a law on this same subject did not propose the
same reward, as the Apostle; but, having said "Love your enemies do good
to them that hate you," which means give them food and drink, He did not
add "for in so doing ye shall heap coals of fire on their heads:" but what
did He say? "that ye may become like your Father who is in Heaven."
Naturally so, for He was discoursing to Peter, James, and John and the
rest of the apostolic band: therefore He proposed that reward. But if you

say that even on this understanding the precept is onerous you improve
once more the defense which I am making for Paul, but you deprive
yourself of every plea of indulgence. For I can prove to you that this
which seems to you onerous was accomplished under the Old
Dispensation when the manifestation of spiritual wisdom was not so great
as it is now. Impressions which were employed by him who originally
brought it in, that he might leave no room for excuse to those who do not
observe it: for the precept "if thine enemy hunger feed him, if he thirst
give him drink" is not the utterance of Paul in the first instance, but of
Solomon. For this reason he quoted the words that he might persuade the
hearer that for one who has been advanced to such a high standard of
wisdom to regard an old law as onerous and grievous which was often
fulfilled by the men of old time, is one of the basest things possible. Which
of the ancients, you ask, fulfilled it? There were many, but amongst others
David especially did so more abundantly? He did not indeed merely give
food or drink to his enemy, but also rescued him several times from death,
when he was in jeopardy; and when he had it in his power to slay him he
spared him once, twice, yea many times. As for Saul he hated and
abhorred him so much after the countless good services which he had done,
after his brilliant triumphs, and the salvation which he had wrought in the
matter of Goliath, that he could not bear to mention him by his own name,
but called him after his father. For once when a festival was at hand, and
Saul, having devised some treachery against him, and contrived a cruel
plot, did not see him arrive "where," said he, "is the son of Jesse?" He
called him by his father's name, both because on account of his hatred he
could not endure the recollection of his proper name, and also because he
thought to damage the distinguished position of that righteous man by a
reference to his low birth; - a miserable and despicable thought: for
certainly, even if he had some accusation to bring against the father this
could in no wise injure David. For each man is answerable for his own
deeds, and by these he can be praised and accused. But as it was, not
having any evil deed to mention, he brought forward his low birth,
expecting by this means to throw his glory into the shade, which in fact
was the height of folly. For what kind of offense is it to be the child of
insignificant and humble then, "the son of Jesse," but when David found
him sleeping inside the cave, he did not call him the "son of Kish," but by
his title of honor: "for I will not lift up my hand," he said, "against the

Lord's anointed." So purely free was he from wrath and resentment of
injuries: he calls him the Lord's anointed who had done him such great
wrongs, who countless good services had many times attempted to
destroy him. For he did not consider how Saul deserved to be treated, but
he considered what was becoming for himself both to do and to say, which
is the greatest stretch of moral wisdom. How so? When thou hast got thy
enemy in a prison, made fast by a twofold, or rather by a triple chain,
confinement of space, dearth of assistance, and necessity of sleep, dost
thou not demand a penalty and punishment of him? "No," he says; "for I
am not now regarding what he deserves to suffer, but what it behooves me
to do." He did not look to the facility for slaying, but to the accurate
observance of the moral wisdom which was becoming to him. And yet
which of the existing circumstances was not sufficient to prompt him to
the act of slaughter? Was not the fact that his enemy was delivered bound
into his hands a sufficient inducement? For you are aware I suppose that
we hasten more eagerly to deeds for which facilities abound, and the hope
of success increases our desire to act, which was just what happened then
in his case.

Well! did the captain who then counseled and urged him to the deed, did
the memory of past events induce him to slay? no one of these things
moved him: in fact the very facility for slaughter averted him from it: for
he bethought him that God had put Saul in his hands for the purpose of
furnishing ample ground and opportunity for the exercise of moral
wisdom. You then perhaps admire him, because he did not cherish the
memory of any of his past evils: but I am much more astonished at him for
another reason. And what is this? that the fear of future events did not
impel him to lay violent hands on his enemy. For he knew dearly that if
Saul escaped his hands, he would again be his adversary; yet he preferred
exposing himself to danger by letting go the man who had wronged him, to
providing for his own security by laying violent hands upon his foe. What
could equal then the great and generous spirit of this man, who, when the
law commanded eye to be plucked out for eye, and tooth for tooth, and
retaliation on equal terms, not only abstained from doing this, but
exhibited a far greater measure of moral wisdom? At least if he had slain
Saul at that time he would have retained credit for moral wisdom
unimpaired, not merely because he had acted on the defensive, not being

himself the originator of violence, but also because by his great moderation
he was superior to the precept "an eye for an eye." For he would not have
inflicted one slaughter in return for one; but, in return for many deaths,
which Saul endeavored to bring on him, having attempted to slay him not
once or twice but many times, he would have brought only one death on
Saul; and not only this, but if he had proceeded to avenge himself out of
fear of the future, even this, combined with the things already mentioned,
would procure him the reward of forbearance without any deduction. For
he who is angry on account of the things which have been done to him, and
demands misses the consideration of all past evils, although they are many
and painful, but is compelled to take steps for self-defense from fear of the
future, and by way of providing for his own security, no one would
deprive him of the rewards of moderation.

7. Nevertheless David did not act even thus, but found a novel and strange
form of moral wisdom: and neither the remembrance of things past, nor the
fear of things to come, nor the instigation of the captain, nor the solitude
of the place, nor the facility for slaying, nor anything else incited him to
kill; but he spared the man who was his enemy, and had given him pain
just as if he was some benefactor, and had done him much good. What kind
of indulgence then shall we have, if we are mindful of past transgressions,
and avenge ourselves on those who have given us pain, whereas that
innocent man who had undergone such great sufferings and expected more
and death the man who would cause him endless troubles?

His moral wisdom then we may perceive, not only from the fact that he
did not slay Saul, when there was so strong a compulsion, but also that he
did not utter an irreverent word against him, although he who was insulted
would not have heard him. Yet we often speak evil of friends when they
are absent, he on the contrary not even of the enemy who had done him
such great wrong. His moral wisdom then we may perceive from these
things: but his lovingkindness and tender care from what he did after these
things. For when he had cut off the fringe of Saul's garment, and had taken
away the bottle of water he withdrew afar off and stood and shouted, and
exhibited these things to him whose life he had by his deeds that he
suspected him without a cause as his enemy, and aiming therefore at
winning him into friendship. Nevertheless when he had even thus failed to
persuade him, and could have laid hands on him, he again chose rather to

be an exile from his country and to sojourn in a strange land, and suffer
distress every day, in procuring necessary food than to remain at home
and vex his adversary. What spirit could be kinder than his? He was indeed
justified in saying "Lord remember David and all his meekness." Let us
also imitate him, and let us neither say nor do evil to our enemies, but
benefit them according to our power: for we shall do more good to
ourselves than to them. "For if ye forgive your enemies," we are told "ye
shall be forgiven." Forgive base offenses that thou mayest receive a royal
pardon for thy offenses; but if any one has done thee great wrongs, the
greater the wrongs you forgive, the greater will be the pardon which you
will receive. Therefore we have been instructed to say "Forgive us, as we
forgive," that we may learn that the measure of our forgiveness takes its
beginning in the first place from ourselves. Wherefore in proportion to the
severity of the evil which the enemy does to us is the greatness of the
benefit which he bestows. Let us then be earnest and eager to be reconciled
with those who have vexed us, whether their wrath be just or unnecessity
that the trial of the case should be brought forward in the other world. As
then many men when they have a dispute with one another, if they come
to a friendly understanding together outside the law court save themselves
loss, and alarm, and many risks, the issue of the case turning out in
accordance with the sentiment of each party; but if they severally entrust
the affair to the judge the only result to them will be loss of money, and in
many cases a penalty, and the permanent endurance of their hatred; even
so here if we come to terms during our present life we shall relieve
ourselves from all punishment; but if while remaining enemies we depart
to that terrible tribunal in the other world we shall certainly pay the
utmost penalty at the sentence of the judge there, and shall both of us
undergo inexorable punishment: he who is unjustly wroth because he is
thus unjustly disposed, and he who is justly wroth, because he has,
however justly, cherished resentment. For even if we have been unjustly
ill-treated, we ought to grant pardon to those who have wronged us. And
observe how he urges and incites those who have unjustly given pain to
reconciliation with those whom they have wronged. "If thou offerest thy
gift before the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought
against thee, go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother." He did not
say, "assemble, and offer thy sacrifice" but "be reconciled and then offer
it." Let it lie there, he says, in order that the necessity of making the

offering may constrain him who is justly wroth to come to terms even
against his will. See how he again prompts us to go to the man who has
provoked us when he says "Forgive your debtors in order that your
Father may also forgive your trespasses." For He did not propose a small
reward, but one which far exceeds the magnitude of the achievement.
Considering all these things then, and counting the recompense which is
given in this case and remembering that to wipe away sins does not entail
much labor and zeal, let us pardon those who have wronged us. For that
which others scarcely accomplish, I mean the blotting out of their own
sins by means of fasting and lamentations, and prayers, and sackcloth, and
ashes, this it is possible for us easily to effect without sackcloth and ashes
and fasting if only we blot out anger from our heart, and with sincerity
forgive those who have wronged us. May the God of peace and love,
having banished from our soul all wrath and bitterness, and anger, deign to
grant that we being closely knit one to another according to the proper
adjustment of the parts, may with one accord, one mouth and one soul
continually offer up our hymns of thanksgiving due to Him: for to Him be
glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.

1. I ACCOUNT you happy for the zeal, beloved, with which you flock into
the Father's house. For from this zeal I have ground for feeling confidence
about your health also with respect to the soul; for indeed the school of
the Church is an admirable surgery - a surgery, not for bodies, but for
souls. For it is spiritual, and sets right, not fleshly wounds, but errors of
the mind, and of these errors and wounds the medicine is the word. This
medicine is compounded, not from the herbs growing on the earth, but
from the words proceeding from heaven - this no hands of physicians,
but tongues of preachers have dispensed. On this account it lasts right
through; and neither is its virtue impaired by length of time, nor defeated
by any strength of diseases. For certainly the medicines of physicians
have both these defects; for while they are fresh they display their proper
strength, but when much time has passed; just as those bodies which have
grown old; they become weaker; and often too the difficult character of
maladies is wont to baffle them; since they are but human. Whereas the
divine medicine is not such as this; but after much time has intervened, it
still retains all its inherent virtue. Ever since at least Moses was born (for
from thence dates the beginning of the Scripture) it has healed so many
human beings; and not only has it not lost its proper power, but neither
has any disease ever yet overcome it. This medicine it is not possible to
get by payment of silver; but he who has displayed sincerity of purpose
and disposition goes his way having it all. On account of this both rich and
poor alike obtain the benefit of this healing process. For where there is a
necessity to pay down money the man of large means indeed shares the
benefit; but the poor man often has to go away deprived of the gain, since
his income does not suffice him for the making up of the medicine. But in
this case, since it is not possible to pay down silver coin, but it is needful
to display faith and a good purpose, he who has paid down these with
forwardness of mind, this is he who most reaps the advantage; since
indeed these are the price paid for the medicinal treatment. And the rich

and the poor man share the benefit alike; or rather it is not alike that they
share the benefit, but often the poor man goes away in the enjoyment of
more. What ever can be the reason? It is because the rich man, possessed
beforehand by many thoughts, having the pride and puffed-up temper
belonging to wealthiness; living with carelessness and lazy ease as
companions, receives the medicine of the hearing of the Scriptures not
with much attention, nor with much earnestness; but the poor man, far
removed from delicate living and gluttony and indolence; spending all his
time in handicraft and honest labors; and gathering hence much love of
wisdom for the soul; becomes thereby more attentive and free from
slackness, and is wont to give his mind with more accurate care to all that
is said: whence also, inasmuch as the price he has paid is higher, the
benefit which he departs having reaped is greater.

2. It is not as absolutely bringing an accusation against those who are
wealthy that I say all this; nor as praising the poor without reference to
circumstances: for neither is wealth an evil, but the having made a bad use
of wealth; nor is poverty a virtue, but the having made a virtuous use of
poverty. That rich man who was in the time of Lazarus was punished, not
because he was rich, but because he was cruel and inhuman. And that poor
man who rested in the bosom of Abraham was praised, not because he was
poor, but because he had born his poverty with thankfulness.

For of things - (now attend carefully to this saying; for it will avail to
put into you sufficient religious knowledge, and to cast out all unsound
reasoning, and to bring about your having your judgment right concerning
the truth of things) - well, of things some are by nature morally good,
and others the contrary; and others neither good nor evil, but they occupy
the intermediate position. A good thing piety is by nature, impiety an evil
thing; a good thing virtue, an evil thing wickedness; but wealth and
poverty in themselves are neither the one nor the other; but from the will
of those who use them they become either the one or the other. For if thou
hast used thy wealth for purposes of philanthropy, the thing becomes to
thee a foundation of good; but if for rapine and grasping and insolence,
thou hast turned the use of it to the direct opposite; but for this wealth is
not chargeable, but he who has used his wealth for insolence. So also we
may say of poverty: if thou have born it nobly by giving thanks to the
Master, what has been done becomes to thee a cause and ground for

receiving crowns; but if on account of this thou blaspheme thy Creator,
and accuse Him for His providence, thou hast again used the thing to an
evil purpose. But just as in that case it is not wealth that is responsible for
the avarice, but the person who has made a bad use of wealth, so also here
we are not to lay the blame of the blasphemy on poverty, but on him who
did not choose to bear the thing in a sober spirit. For in every case both
the praise and the blame belong to our own will and choice. Good is
wealth, yet not absolutely, but to him only to whom it is not sin; and
again poverty is wicked, but not absolutely, but only in the mouth of the
impious, because he is discontented, because he blasphemes, because he is
indignant, because he accuses Him who has made him.

3. Let us not therefore accuse riches, nor revile poverty absolutely, but
those who do not will to use these virtuously; for the things themselves lie
in the middle. But as I was saying (for it is good to return to the former
subject), both rich and poor enjoy the benefit of the medicines
administered here with the same boldness and freedom; and often the poor
with more earnestness. For the special excellence of the medicines is not
this only, that they heal souls, that their virtue is not destroyed by length
of time, that they are not worsted by any disease, that the benefit is
publicly offered gratuitously, that the healing treatment is on a footing of
equality both for rich and poor - but they have another quality also not
inferior to these good points. Pray of what character is this? It is that we
do not publicly expose those who come to this surgery. For they who go
off to the surgeries of the outside world, have many who examine their
wounds, and unless the physician have first uncovered the sore, he does
not apply the dressing; but here not so, but seeing as we do innumerable
patients, we go through the medical treatment of them in a latent manner.
For not by dragging into publicity those who have sinned do we thus noise
abroad the sins committed by them; but after putting forth our teaching, as
common to all, we leave it entirely to the conscience of the hearers; so that
each may draw to himself from what is said the suitable medicine for his
own wound. For there proceeds the word of doctrine from the tongue of
the speaker, containing accusation of wickedness, praise of virtue, blame
of lewdness, commendation of chasteness, censure of pride, praise of
gentleness, just as a medicine of varied and manifold ingredients,
compounded from every kind; and to take what is applicable to himself

and salutary is the part of each of the hearers. The word then issues
openly, and settling into the conscience of each, secretly both affords the
healing treatment which comes from it, and before the malady has been
divulged, has often restored health.

4. You at all events heard yesterday how I extolled the power of prayer,
how I reproached those who pray with listlessness; without having
publicly exposed one of them. Those then who were conscious to
themselves of earnestness, accepted that commendation of prayer, and
became still more earnest by the praises, while those who were conscious
to themselves of listlessness, accepted on the other hand the rebuking, and
put off their carelessness. But neither these nor those do we know; and
this ignorance is serviceable to both - how, I now tell you. He who has
heard the commendations of prayer and is conscious to himself of
earnestness, were he to have many witnesses of the commendations,
would have lapsed towards pride; but, as it is, by having secretly accepted
the praise, he is removed from all arrogance. On the other hand he who is
conscious to himself of listlessness, having heard the accusation, has
become better from the accusation, as having no one of men a witness of
the rebuking; and this was of no ordinary profit to him. For on account of
the being flurried at the opinion of the vulgar, so long as we may think that
we escape notice in our wickedness, we exert ourselves to become better;
but when we have become notorious to all, and have lost the consolation
derived from the escaping notice, we grow more shameless and remiss
rather. And just as sores become more painful by being unbandaged and
frequently exposed to cold air, so also the soul after having sinned, if in the
presence of many it be rebuked for what it has done amiss, grows thereby
more shameless. In order therefore that this might not take place, the word
administered its medicine to you covertly. And that you may understand
that the gain which this covert treatment has is great, hear what the Christ
says. "If thy brother have committed a fault against thee convince him of
it," and he did not say "between him and the whole town," nor, "between
thee and the whole people," but "only between thee and him." Let the
accusation, he says, be unwitnessed to, in order that the change to
amendment may be made easy of digestion. A great good surely, the
making the advice unpublished. Sufficient is the conscience, sufficient that
incorruptible judge. It is not so much thou who rebukest him who has

done wrong as his own conscience (that accuser is the sharper), nor dost
thou do it with the more exact knowledge of the faults committed. Add not
therefore wound to wound by exposing him who has done wrong; but
administer for thyself the counsel unwitnessed. This therefore we a, re
doing now - the very thing that Paul also did, framing the indictment
against him who among the Corinthians had sinned without citing of
witnesses. And hear how. "On this account," he says, "brethren, I have
applied these figures of speech to myself and Apollos." And yet not he
himself nor Apollos were they who had rent the people in schism and
divided the Church; but all the same he concealed the accusation, and just
as by some masks, by hiding the countenances of the defendants by his
own and Apollos' names, he afforded them power to amend of that
wickedness. And again, "Lest in some way after I have come God humble
me, and I may have to mourn many of those who have before sinned, and
have not repented over the uncleanness and lasciviousness which they had
committed." See how here also he indefinitely mentions those who had
sinned, in order that he might not, by openly bringing the accusation,
render the soul of those who had sinned more shameless. Therefore, just as
we administer our reproofs with so much sparing of your feelings, so do
ye also with all seriousness receive the correction; and attend with
carefulness to what is said.

5. We discoursed to you yesterday about the power which is in prayer. I
pointed out how the devil then lies in wait, deceiver that he is. For since he
sees very great gain accruing to us from prayer, then most he assails us, in
order that he may disable us from our defense; that he may send us off
home empty-handed. And just as before magistrates, when the officers of
the court who are about the person of the magistrate have a hostile feeling
toward those who come before him, they by their staves drive them away
to a distance, preventing their coming near and resorting to lamentation and
so obtaining compassion; so also the devil, when he has seen us coming to
the judge, drives us away to a distance, not by any staff, but through our
own slackness. For he knows, he knows clearly, that if they have come to
him in a sober spirit, and have told the sins committed, and have mourned
with their soul fervent, they will depart having received full forgiveness;
for God loves mankind; and on this account he is beforehand with them,
and debars them from access, in order that they may obtain no one of the

things which they need. But the soldiers of magistrates with violence scare
away those who are coming to them; but he with no compulsion, but by
deceiving us, and throwing us into security. On this account we are not
deserving even of allowance, since we voluntarily deprive ourselves of the
good things. Prayer with earnestness is a light of the understanding and
soul - a light unquenchable and perpetual. On this account he throws into
our minds countless rubbish-heaps of imaginations; and things which we
never had imagined, these collecting together at the very moment of prayer
he pours down upon our souls. And just as winds often rushing from an
opposite quarter by a violent gust extinguish a lamp's flame as it is being
lighted, so also the devil, when he has seen the' flame of our prayer being
kindled, blowing it on every side with the blasts of countless thoughts,
does not desist before and until he has quenched the light. But the very
thing which they who are kindling those lamps do, this let us also do. And
what do they do? When they see a violent wind coming, by laying their
finger upon the opening of the lamp they bar the entrance against the
wind. For so long as he assails from without we shall be able to stand
against him; but when we have opened to him the doors of the mind, and
have received the enemy inside; after that we are no longer able to
withstand even a little; but, having on all sides completely extinguished the
memory, just as a smoking lamp, he allows our mouth to utter empty
words. But just as they put their finger upon the opening of the lamp, so
let us lay consideration upon our mind: let us close off from the wicked
spirit the entrance, in order that he may not quench our light of prayer.
Remember both those illustrations, both that of the soldiers and the
magistrate, and that respecting the lamp. For with this purpose we adduce
to you these illustrations; with which we are conversant, in which we live,
in order that, after we have departed hence and have returned home, we
may from things of familiar occurrence receive a reminder of what has been
said.

6. Prayer is a strong piece of armor and a great security. You heard
yesterday how the three children, fettered as they were, destroyed the
power of the fire; how they trampled down the blaze; how they overcame
the furnace, and conquered the operation of the element. Hear today again
how the noble and great Isaac overcame the nature itself of bodies through
prayer. They destroyed the power of fire, this man today loosed the

bonds of incapacitated nature. And learn how he effected this. "Isaac," it
says, "prayed concerning his wife, because she was barren." This has
today been read to you; yesterday the sermon was about prayer; and
today again there is a demonstration of the power of prayer. See how the
grace of the Spirit has ordered that what has been read today harmonizes
with what was said yesterday. "Isaac," it says, "prayed concerning
Rebecca his wife, because she was barren." This first is worth inquiring
into, for what cause she was barren. She was of a life admirable and replete
with much chastity - both herself and her husband. We cannot lay hold
of the life of those just ones, and say that the barrenness was the work of
sin. And not only was she herself barren, but also his mother Sarah, who
had born him; not only was his mother barren and his wife, but also his
daughter-in-law, the wife of Jacob, Rachel. What is the meaning of this
band of barren ones? All were righteous, all living in virtue, all were
witnessed to by God. For it was of them that He said, "I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Of the same
persons Paul also thus speaks. "For which cause God is not ashamed to
call himself their God." Many are the commendations of them in the New,
many the praises of them in the Old Testament. On all sides they were
bright and illustrious, and yet they all had barren wives, and continued in
childlessness until an advanced period. When therefore thou seest man and
wife living with virtue; when thou seest them beloved of God, caring for
piety, and yet suffering the malady of childlessness; do not suppose that
the childlessness is at all a retribution for sins. For many are God's
reasons for the dispensation, and to us inexplicable; and for all we must be
heartily thankful, and think those only wretched who live in wickedness;
not those who do not possess children. Often God does it expediently,
though we know not the cause of events. On this account in every case it
is our duty to admire His wisdom, and to glorify His unspeakable love of
man.

7. Well, this consideration indeed is able to school us in moral character,
but it is necessary also to state the cause for which those women were
barren. What then was the cause? It was in order that when thou hast seen
the Virgin bringing forth our common Master, thou mightest not
disbelieve. Wherefore exercise thy mind in the womb of the barren; in
order that when thou hast seen the womb, disabled and bound as it is,

being opened to the bearing of children from the grace of God, thou
mightest not marvel at hearing that a virgin has brought forth. Or rather
even marvel and be astounded; but do not disbelieve the marvel. When the
Jew says to thee, "how did the virgin bear?" say to him "how did she bear
who was barren and enfeebled by old age?" There were then two
hindrances, both the unseasonableness of her age and the unserviceableness
of nature; but in the case of the Virgin there was one hindrance only, the
not having shared in marriage. The barren one therefore prepares the way
for the virgin. And that thou mayest learn that it was on this account that
the barren ones had anticipated it, in order that the Virgin's childbirth
might be believed, hear the words of Gabriel which were addressed to her
- For when he had come and said to her, "thou shalt conceive in the
womb and bear a son, and thou shall call his name Jesus;" the Virgin was
astonished and marveled, and said, "how will this be to me, since I know
not a man." What then said the Angel? "The Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee." Seek not the sequence of nature, he says, when that which takes
place is above nature; look not round for marriage and throes of child-birth,
when the manner of the birth is too grand for marriage. "And how will this
be," she says, "since I know not a husband." And verily on this account
shall this be, since thou knowest no husband. For didst thou know a
husband, thou wouldest not have been deemed worthy to serve this
ministry. So that, for the reason why thou disbelievest, for this believe.
And thou wouldest not have been deemed worthy to serve this ministry,
not because marriage is an evil; but because virginity is superior; and fight
it was that the entry of the Master should be more august than ours; for it
was royal, and the king enters through one more august. It was necessary
that He should both share as to birth, and be diverse from ours. Wherefore
both these things are managed.

For the being born from the womb is common in respect to us, but the
being born without marriage is a thing greater than on a level with us. And
the gestation and conception in the belly belongs to human nature; but that
the pregnancy should take place without sexual intercourse is too august
for human nature. And for this purpose both these things took place, in
order that thou mayest learn both the pre-eminence and the fellowship
with thee of Him who was born.

8. And pray consider the wisdom of all that was done. Neither did the
pre-eminence injure the likeness and kinship to us, nor did the kinship to
us dim the pre-eminence; but both were displayed by all the
circumstances; and the one had our condition in its entirety, and the other
what was diverse compared with us. But just as I was saying, on this
account the barren ones went before, in order that the Virgin's child-birth
might be believed, that she might be led by the hand to faith in that
promise and undertaking which she heard from the angel, saying, "The
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the miraculous power of the Most
High shall overshadow thee" - thus, he says, thou art able to bear. Look
not to the earth; it is from the heavens that the operation will come. That
which takes place is a grace of the Spirit; pray inquire not about nature and
laws of marriage. But since those words were too high for her, he wills to
afford also another demonstration. But do thou, pray, observe how the
barren one leads her on the way to the belief in this. For since that
demonstration was too high for the Virgin's intelligence, hear how he
brought down what he said to lower things also, leading her by the hand
by sensible facts. For "behold," he says, "Elizabeth thy kinswoman -
she also has conceived a son in her old age; and this month is the sixth to
her who was called barren." Seest thou that the barren one was for the sake
of the Virgin? since with what object did he adduce to her the child-bearing
of her kinswoman? with what object did he say, "in her old age?" with
what object did he add, "who was called barren?" It was by way of
inducing her by all these things, manifestly, to the believing the glad
annunciation. For this cause he spoke of both the age and the disabling
effect of nature; for this cause he awaited the time also which had elapsed
from the conception; for he did not tell to her the glad tidings immediately
from the beginning, but awaited for a six-months period to have passed to
the barren one, in order that the puerperal swelling might, for the rest, be a
pledge of the pregnancy, and an indisputable demonstration might arise of
the conception. And pray again look at the intelligence of Gabriel. For he
neither reminded her of Sarah, nor of Rebecca, nor of Rachel; and yet they
also were barren, and they had grown old, and that which took place was a
marvel; but the stories were ancient. Now things new and recent and
occurring in our generation are wont to induce us into the belief of marvels
more than those which are old. On this account having let those women
alone, that she should understand from her kinswoman Elizabeth herself

what was coming upon her, he brought it forward; so as from her to lead
her to her own - that most awful and august childbirth. For the
child-birth of the barren one lay between ours and that of the Master less
indeed than that of the Virgin, but greater than ours. On this account it was
by Elizabeth lying between, just as by some bridge, that he lifted up the
mind of the Virgin from the travail which is according to nature, to that
which is above nature.

9. I did desire to say more, and to teach you other reasons for which
Rebecca, and Rachel, were barren; but the time does not permit; urging on
the discourse to the power of prayer. For on this account indeed I have
mooted all these points, that ye might understand how the prayer of Isaac
unbound the barrenness of his wife; and that prayer for so long a time.
"Isaac," it says, "continually prayed about Rebecca his wife, and God
listened to him." For do not suppose that he invoked God and had
immediately been listened to; for he had spent much time in praying to
God. And if you desire to learn how much, I will tell you this too with
exactness. He had spent the number of twenty years in praying to God.
Whence is this manifest? from the sequence itself. For the Scripture,
desiring to point out the faith and the endurance and the love of wisdom of
that righteous man, did not break off and leave untold even the time, but
made it also clear to us, covertly indeed, so as to rouse up our indolence;
but nevertheless did not allow it to be uncertain, Hear then how it covertly
indicated to us the time. "Now Isaac was forty years old when he took
Rebecca, a daughter of Bethuel the Syrian." You hear how many years old
he was when he brought home his wife: "Forty years old," it says, "he
was when he took Rebecca." But since we have learnt how many years old
he was when he married his wife, let us learn also when he after all became
a father, and how many years old he was then, when he begat Jacob; and
we shall be able to see how long a time his wife had remained barren; and
that during all that time he continued to pray to God. How many years old
then was he when he begat Jacob? "Jacob," it says, "came forth laying
hold with his right hand of his brother's heel: on this account he called him
Jacob, and him Esau. Now Isaac was sixty years old when he begat them."
If therefore when he brought Rebecca home he was forty years old, and
when he begat the sons sixty, it is very plain that his wife had remained

barren for twenty years between, and during all this time Isaac continued
to pray to God.

10. After this do we not feel shame, and hide our faces, at seeing that
righteous man for twenty years persevering and not desisting; we
ourselves after a first or second petition often fainting and indignant? And
yet he indeed had in large measure liberty of speech towards God, and all
the same he felt no discontent at the delay of the giving, but remained
patient, whereas we, laden with countless sins, living with an evil
conscience, displaying no good will towards the Master; if we are not
heard before having spoken, are bewildered, impatiently recoil, desist from
asking - on this account we always retire with empty hands. Who has for
twenty years besought God for one thing, as this righteous man did? or
rather who for twenty months only? Yesterday I was saying that they are
many who pray with slackness, and yawning, and stretching themselves,
and continually shifting their attitude, and indulging in every carelessness
in their prayers - but today I have found also another damage attaching
itself to their prayers more destructive than that one. For many, throwing
themselves prostrate, and striking the ground with their forehead, and
pouring forth hot tears, and groaning bitterly from the heart and stretching
out their hands, and displaying much earnestness, employ this warmth and
forwardness against their own salvation. For it is not on behalf of their
own sins that they beseech God; nor are they asking forgiveness of the
offenses committed by them; but they are exerting this earnestness against
their enemies entirely, doing just the same thing as if one, after whetting
his sword, were not to use the weapon against his enemies, but to thrust it
through his own throat. So these also use their prayers not for the
remission of their own sins, but about revenge on their enemies; which is
to thrust the sword against themselves. This too the wicked one has
devised, in order that on all sides we may destroy ourselves, both through
slackness and through earnestness. For the one class by their carelessness
in their prayers exasperate God, by displaying contempt through their
slackness; and the others, when they display earnestness, display the
earnestness on the other hand against their own salvation. "A certain
person," he (the devil) says, "is slack: that is sufficient for me with a view
to his obtaining nothing; this man is earnest and thoroughly aroused; what
then must be done to accomplish the same result? I cannot slacken his

earnestness, nor throw him into carelessness; I will contrive his
destruction in the other way. How so? I will manage that he use his
earnestness for transgressing the law:" (for the praying against one's
personal enemies is a transgression of law). "He shall depart therefore not
only having gained nothing by his earnestness, but also having endured the
hurt which is greater than that caused through slackness." Such as these are
the injuries of the devil: the one sort he destroys through their remissness;
and the other through the earnestness itself, when it is shown not
according to God's laws.

11. But it is also worth hearing the very words of their prayer, and how
the words are of a puerile mind; of how infantile a soul. I am ashamed in
truth when about to repeat them; but it is absolutely necessary to repeat
them, and to imitate that coarse tongue. What then are the words?
"Avenge me of my enemies, show them that I too have God (on my
side)." They do not then learn, man, that we have God, when we are
indignant and angry and impatient; but when we are gentle and meek and
subdued, and practice all love of wisdom. So also God said, "Let your light
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
Father who is in the heavens." Perceivest thou not that it is an insult to
God, the making a request to God against thine enemies? And how is it an
insult? one will say. Because He Himself said, "pray for your enemies;"
and brought in this divine law. When therefore thou claimest that the
legislator should relax his own laws; and callest upon him to legislate in
opposition to himself; and supplicatest him who had forbidden thee to
pray against thine enemies to hear thee praying against thine enemies; thou
art not praying in doing this, nor calling upon him; but thou art insulting
the lawgiver, and acting with drunken violence towards him, who is sure to
give to thee the good things which result from prayer. And how is it
possible to be heard when praying, tell me, when thou exasperatest him
who is sure to hear? For by doing these things thou art pushing thine own
salvation into a pit, and art rushing down a precipice, by striking thine
enemy before the king's eyes. For even if thou doest not this with the
hands, with thy words thou strikest him, the thing which thou darest not
do even in the case of thy fellow-slaves. At least dare to do this in a ruler's
presence, and though thou hast done countless public services, thou wilt
straightway surely be led away to execution. Then (I ask) in the presence

of a ruler dost thou not dare to insult thine equal, but when doing this in
God's presence, tell me, dost thou not shudder, nor fear when in the time
of entreaty and prayer bring so savage and turning thyself into a wild
beast; and displaying greater want of feeling than he who demanded
payment of the hundred pence? For that thou art more insolent than he,
listen to the story itself. A certain man owed ten thousand talents to his
master; then, not having (where-with) to pay, he entreated him to be
long-suffering, in order that, his wife having been sold and his house and
his children, he might settle his master's claim. And the master seeing him
lamenting had compassion on him, and remitted the ten thousand talents.
He having gone out and found another servant owing him a hundred pence,
seizing his throat demanded them with great cruelty and inhumanity. The
Master having heard this threw him into the prison, and laid on him again
the debt of the ten thousand talents which he had before remitted; and he
paid the penalty of the cruelty shown towards his fellow-servant.

12. Now do thou consider in how much more unfeeling and insensible in a
way thou hast acted even than he, praying against thine enemies. He did
not beg his master to demand, but he himself demanded, the hundred
pence; whereas thou even callest on the Master for this shameless and
forbidden demand. And he seized his fellow-servant's throat not before his
lord's eyes, but outside; while thou in the very moment of prayer,
standing in the King's presence, doest this. And if he, for doing this
without either having urged his master to the demand, and after going
forth, met with no forgiveness; thou, both stirring up the Master to
(exacting) this forbidden payment, and doing this before his eyes, what
sort of penalty will thou have to pay? tell me. But thy mind is inflamed
by the memory of the enmity, and swells, and thy heart rises, and when
recurring in memory to him who has caused pain, thou art unable to reduce
the swelling of thy thought. But set against this inflammation the memory
resulting from thine own sins committed the fear resulting from the
punishment to come. Recall to memory for how many things thou art
accountable to thy master, and that for all those things thou owest Him
satisfaction; and this fear will surely overcome that anger; since indeed this
is far more powerful than that passion. Recall the memory of hell and
punishment and vengeance during the time of thy prayer; and thou wilt
not be able even to receive thine enemy into thy mind. Make thy mind

contrite, humble thy soul by the memory of the offenses committed by
thee, and wrath will not be able even to trouble thee. But the cause of all
these evils is this, that we scrutinize the sins of all others with great
exactitude; while we let our own pass with great remissness. Whereas we
ought to do the contrary - to keep our own faults unforgotten; but never
even to admit a thought of those of others. If we do this we shall both
have God propitious, and shall cease cherishing immortal anger against our
neighbors, and we shall never have any one as an enemy; and even if we
should have at any time we shall both quickly put an end to his enmity,
and should obtain speedy pardon for our own sins. For just as he who
treasures up the memory of wrong against his neighbor does not permit
the punishment upon his own sins to be done away; so he who is clear of
anger will speedily be clear of sins also. For if we, wicked as we are and
enslaved to passion, on account of the commandment of God overlook all
the faults committed against us, much more will He who is a lover of
mankind, and good, and free from any passion, overlook our delinquencies,
rendering to us the recompense of our kindly spirit towards our neighbor
in the forgiveness of our own sins: which God grant that we may attain,
by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is the
glory and the dominion, to the ages of the ages. Amen.

INTRODUCTION TO
THE TWO HOMILIES ON EUTROPIUS

THE interest of the two following discourse depends not only on their
intrinsic value as specimens of Chrysostom's eloquence, but also on the
singular and dramatic character of the incidents which gave occasion to
them.

Arcadius the Emperor of the East like his brother Honorius the Emperor
of the West was a man of feeble intellect. The history of the Empire under
their reign is a melancholy record of imbecility on the part of the nominal
rulers; of faithlessness and unscrupulous ambition on the part of their
ministers. The chief administrator of affairs in the beginning of the reign of
Arcadius was Rufinus, an Aquitanian Gaul; the very model of an
accomplished adventurer. His intrigues, his arrogance, his rapacious avarice
excited the indignation of the people, and he was at last assassinated by
the troops to whom he was making an oration in the presence of the
Emperor. His place in the favor and confidence of Arcadius was soon
occupied by the eunuch Eutropius. The career of this person was a strange
one. Born a slave, in the region of Mesopotamia, he had passed in
boyhood and youth through the hands of many owners, performing the
most menial offices incident to his position. At length Arnithus, an old
military officer who had become his master, presented him to his daughter
on her marriage; and in the words of the poet Claudian "the future counsel
of the East was made over as part of a marriage dowry." But the young
lady after a time grew tired of the slave who was becoming elderly and
wrinkled, and without trying to sell him turned him out of her household.
He picked up a precarious living in Constantinople and was often in great
want until an officer about court too pity on him, and procured him a
situation in the lower ranks of the imperial chamberlains. This was the
beginning of his rise. By the diligence with which he discharged his humble
duties, by occasional witty sayings, and the semblance of a fervent piety
he attracted the notice of the great Emperor Theodosius (the father of
Arcadius), and gradually won his confidence so as to be employed on
difficult and delicate missions. On the death of Theodosius he became in
the capacity of grand chamberlain the intimate advisor and constant

attendant of Arcadius and the most subtle and determined rival of Rufinus.
It was by his contrivance that the scheme of Rufinus for marrying his own
daughter to the Emperor was defeated: and that Eudoxia the daughter of a
Frankish general was substituted for her. After the murder of Rufinus the
government was practically in his hands; but he exercised his power more
craftily that the vain and boastful Gaul. He contrived at first to discharge
all the duties which fell to his lot as chamberlain with humble assiduity,
and sought no other title than he already possessed. Slowly but surely
however he climbed to the summit of power by the simple process of
putting out of the way on various pretexts all dangerous competitors. He
deprived his victims of their last hope of escape by abolishing the right of
the Church to afford shelter to fugitives. He sold the chief offices of the
State, and the command of the provinces to the highest bidders. By
surrounding the Emperor with a crowd of frivolous companions, by
dissipating his mind with a perpetual round of amusements, by taking him
every spring to Ancyra in Phrygia where he was subjected to the
enervating influence of a soft climate and luxurious style of living he made
the naturally feeble intellect of Arcadius more feeble still and withdrew it
from the power of every superior mind but his own. From the pettiest
detail of domestic life to the most important affairs of state, the wily
minister at length ruled supreme. Arcadius was little more than a
magnificently dressed puppet, and the eunuch slave was the real master of
half the Roman world. It was by his advice that on the death of Nectarius
in 397 Chrysostom had been appointed, very much against his own will,
to the vacant See of Constantinople. If Eutropius expected to find a
complaisant courtier in the new Archbishop he certainly sustained a severe
disappointment. Some little pretenses which he made of assisting the work
of the Church by patronizing Chrysostom's missionary projects could not
blind the Archbishop to the gross venality of his administration, or exempt
him from the censure and warning of one who was too honest and bold to
be any respecter of person. In fact when the Archbishop declaimed against
the cupidity and oppressions of the rich it was obvious to all that
Eutropius was the most signal example of those vices. At last the minister,
not content to remain as he was - enjoying the reality of power without
the name - prepared the way for his own ruin by inducing the Emperor
to bestow on him the titles of Patrician and Consul. The acquisition of
these venerable names by the eunuch slave caused a profound sensation of

shame and indignation throughout the Empire, but especially in the
Western capital, where they were bound up with all the noblest and most
glorious memories in the history of the Roman people. The name of
Eutropius was omitted from the Fasti or catalogue of consuls inscribed in
the Capitol at Rome. Amidst the general decadence and degeneracy of
public spirit in the Empire the West did not descend, could not have
descended, to those depths of servile adulation to which the Byzantines
stopped at the inauguration of Eutropius as Consul. The senate, and all the
great officials military and civil, poured into the palace of the Caesars to
offer their homage, and emulated each other in the honor of kissing the
hand and even the wrinkled visage of the eunich. They saluted him as the
bulwark of the laws, and the second father of the Emperor. Statues of
bronze or marble were placed in various parts of the city representing him
in the costume of warrior or judge, and the inscriptions on them styled him
third founder of the city after Byzas, and Constantine. No wonder that
Claudian declaimed with bitter sarcasm against "a Byzantine nobility and
Greek divinities" and invokes Neptune by a stroke of his trident to unseat
and submerge the degenerate city which had inflicted such a deep disgrace
upon the Empire. A blow indeed was about to fall upon the eastern
capital, directed not by the hand of a mythic deity, but of a stout barbarian
soldier. The consequences of it were averted from the city only by the
sacrifice of the new consul upon whom it fell with crushing effect. He sank
never to rise again. Tribigild, a distinguished Gothic soldier who had been
raised to the rank of Tribune in the Roman army, had demanded higher
promotion for himself and higher pay for a body of military colonists in
Phrygia of which he had the command. His petition had been coldly
dismissed by Eutropius; Tribigild resented the affront and with the troops
which he commanded broke into revolt. Eutropius entrusted the conduct
of an expedition against him to one of his favorites, who suffered a most
ignominious defeat in which he perished, and the greater part of his army
was cut to pieces. Constantinople was convulsed with terror and
indignation. Gainas another Goth in command of the city troops declared
that he could do nothing to check the progress of the revolt unless
Eutropius was banished, the principal author of all the evils of the State.
His demand was backed by the Empress Eudoxia, who had experienced
much insolence from the minister. Eutropius was deprived of his official
dignity, his property was declared confiscated, and he was commanded to

quit the palace instantly under pain of death. Whither could the poor
wretch fly who was thus in a moment hurled from the pinnacle of power
into the lowest depths of degradation and destitution. There was but on
place to which he could naturally turn in his distress - the sanctuary of
the Church; but by the cruel irony of his fate, a law of his own devising
here barred his entrance. Yet he knew that the law prohibiting asylum had
been resented and resisted by the Church and it might be that the
Archbishop would connive at the violation of the obnoxious measure by
the very person who had passed it. He resolved to make the experiment.
In the humblest guise of a suppliant, tears streaming down his puckered
cheeks, his scant gray hairs smeared with dust, he crept into the Cathedral,
drew aside the curtain in front of the altar and clung to one of the columns
which supported it. Here he was found by Chrysostom in a state of
pitiable and abject terror, for soldiers in search of him had entered the
Church, and the clattering of their arms would be heard on the other side of
the thin partition which concealed the fugitive. With quivering lips he
craved the asylum of the church, and he was not repulsed as the destroyer
of the refuge which he now sought. Chrysostom rejoiced in the
opportunity afforded to the church of taking a noble revenge on her
adversary. He concealed Eutropius in the sacristy, confronted his
pursuers, and refused to surrender him. "None shall violate the sanctuary
save over my body: the church is the bride of Christ who has entrusted her
honor to me and I will never betray it." He desired to be conducted to the
Emperor and taken like a prisoner between two rows of spearmen from
the Cathedral to the palace where he boldly vindicated the church's right
of asylum in the presence of the Emperor. Arcaius promised to respect the
retreat of the fallen minister, and with difficulty persuaded the angry
troops to accept his decision. The next day was Sunday, and the Cathedral
was thronged with a vast multitude eager to hear what the golden mouth of
the Archbishop would utter who had dared in defense of the Church's
right to defy the law, and confront the tide of popular feeling. But few
probably were prepared to witness such a dramatic scene as was actually
presented. The Archbishop had just taken his seat in the "Ambon" or high
reading desk a little westward of the chancel from which he was wont to
preach on account of his diminutive stature, and a sea of faces was
upturned to him waiting for the stream of golden eloquence when the
curtain of the sanctuary was drawn aside and disclosed the cowering form

of the miserable Eutropius clinging to one of the columns of the Holy
Table. Many a time had the Archbishop preached to unheeding ears on the
vain and fleeting character of worldly honor, prosperity, luxury and
wealth; now he would force attention, and drive home his lesson to the
hearts of his vast congregation by pointing to a visible example of fallen
grandeur in the poor wretch who lay groveling behind him.

Eutropius remained for some days within the precincts of the Church and
then suddenly departed. Whether he mistrusted the security of his shelter
and hope to make his escape in disguise, or whether he surrendered himself
on the understanding that exile would be substituted for capital
punishment cannot be certainly known. Chrysostom declared that if he
had not abandoned the Church, the Church would never have given him
up. Anyhow he was captured and conveyed to Cyprus, but soon
afterwards he was tried at Constantinople on various charges of high
crimes and misdemeanors against the State, and condemned to suffer
capital punishment. He was taken to Chalcedon and there beheaded. The
second of the two following discourses was delivered a few days after
Eutropius had quitted the sanctuary of the Church.

EUTROPIUS,
PATRICIAN AND CONSUL

HOMILY 1

ON EUTROPIUS, THE EUNUCH, PATRICIAN AND CONSUL

1. "VANITY of vanities, all is vanity" - it is always seasonable to utter
this but more especially at the present time. Where are now the brilliant
surroundings of thy consulship? where are the gleaming torches? Where is
the dancing, and the noise of dancers' feet, and the banquets and the
festivals? where are the garlands and the curtains of the theater? where is
the applause which greeted thee in the city, where the acclamation in the
hippodrome and the flatteries of spectators? They are gone - all gone: a
wind has blown upon the tree shattering down all its leaves, and showing
it to us quite bare, and shaken from its very root; for so great has been the
violence of the blast, that it has given a shock to all these fibers of the tree
and threatens to tear it up from the roots. Where now are your reigned
friends? where are your drinking parties, and your suppers? where is the
swarm of parasites, and the wine which used to be poured forth all day
long, and the manifold dainties invented by your cooks? where are they
who courted your power and did and said everything to win your favor?
They were all mere visions of the night, and dreams which have vanished
with the dawn of day: they were spring flowers, and when the spring was
over they all withered: they were a shadow which has passed away -
they were a smoke which has dispersed, bubbles which have burst,
cobwebs which have been rent in pieces. Therefore we chant continually
this spiritual song - "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." For this saying
ought to be continually written on our walls, and garments, in the market
place, and in the house, on the streets, and on the doors and entrances, and
above all on the conscience of each one, and to be a perpetual theme for
meditation. And inasmuch as deceitful things, and maskings and pretense
seem to many to be realities it behooves each one every day both at
supper and at breakfast, and in social assemblies to say to his neighbor and

to hear his neighbor say in return "vanity of vanities, all is vanity." Was I
not continually telling thee that wealth was a runaway? But you would
not heed me. Did I not tell thee that it was an unthankful servant? But you
would not be persuaded. Behold actual experience has now proved that it
is not only a runaway, and ungrateful servant, but also a murderous one,
for it is this which has caused thee now to fear and tremble. Did I not say
to thee when you continually rebuked me for speaking the truth, "I love
thee better than they do who flatter thee?" "I who reprove thee care more
for thee than they who pay thee court?" Did I not add to these words by
saying that the wounds of friends were more to be relied upon than the
voluntary kisses of enemies. If you had submitted to my wounds their
kisses would not have wrought thee this destruction: for my wounds work
health, but their kisses have produced an incurable disease. Where are now
thy cup-bearers, where are they who cleared the way for thee in the
market place, and sounded thy praises endlessly in the ears of all? They
have fled, they have disowned thy friendship, they are providing for their
own safety by means of thy distress. But I do not act thus, nay in thy
misfortune I do not abandon thee, and now when thou art fallen I protect
and tend thee. And the Church which you treated as an enemy has opened
her bosom and received thee into it; whereas the theatres which you
courted, and about which you were oftentimes indignant with me have
betrayed and ruined thee. And yet I never ceased saying to thee "why
doest thou these things?" "thou art exasperating the Church, and casting
thyself down headlong," yet thou didst hurry away from all my warnings.
And now the hippodromes, having exhausted thy wealth, have whetted
the sword against thee, but the Church which experienced thy untimely
wrath is hurrying in every direction, in her desire to pluck thee out of the
net.

2. And I say these things now not as trampling upon one who is prostrate,
but from a desire to make those who are still standing more secure; not by
way of irritating the sores of one who has been wounded, but rather to
preserve those who have not yet been wounded in sound health; not by
way of sinking one who is tossed by the waves, but as instructing those
who are sailing with a favorable breeze, so that they may not become
overwhelmed. And how may this be effected? by observing the
vicissitudes of human affairs. For even this man had he stood in fear of

vicissitude would not have experienced it; but whereas neither his own
conscience, nor the counsels of others wrought any improvement in him,
do ye at least who plume yourselves on your riches profit by his calamity:
for nothing is weaker than human affairs. Whatever term therefore one
may employ to express their insignificance it will fall short of the reality;
whether he calls them smoke, or grass, or a dream or spring flowers, or by
any other name; so perishable are they, and more naught than nonentities;
but that together with their nothingness they have also a very perilous
element we have a proof before us. For who was more exalted than this
man? Did he not surpass the whole world in wealth? had he not climbed to
the very pinnacle of distinction? did not all tremble and fear before him?
Yet lo! he has become more wretched than the prisoner, more pitiable than
the menial slave, more indigent than the beggar wasting away with hunger,
having every day a vision of sharpened swords and of the criminal's grave,
and the public executioner leading him out to his death; and he does not
even know if he once enjoyed past pleasure, nor is he sensible even of the
sun's ray, but at mid day his sight is dimmed as if he were encompassed
by the densest gloom. But even let me try my best I shall not be able to
present to you in language the suffering which he must naturally undergo,
in the hourly expectation of death. But indeed what need is there of any
words from me, when he himself has clearly depicted this for us as in a
visible image? For yesterday when they came to him from the royal court
intending to drag him away by force, and he ran for refuge to the holy
furniture, his face was then, as it is now, no better than the countenance of
one dead: and the chattering of his teeth, and the quaking and quivering of
his whole body, and his faltering voice, and stammering tongue, and in fact
his whole general appearance were suggestive of one whose soul was
petrified.

3. Now I say these things not by way of reproaching him, or insulting his
misfortune, but from a desire to soften your minds towards him, and to
induce you to compassion, and to persuade you to be contented with the
punishment which has already been inflicted. For since there are many
inhuman persons amongst us who are inclined, perhaps, to find fault with
me for having admitted him to the sanctuary, I parade his sufferings from a
desire to soften their hardheartedness by my narrative.

For tell me, beloved brother, wherefore art thou indignant with me? You
say it is because he who continually made war upon the Church has taken
refuge within it. Yet surely we ought in the highest degree to glorify God,
for permitting him to be placed in such a great strait as to experience both
the power and the lovingkindness of the Church: - her power in that he
has suffered this great-vicissitude in consequence of the attacks which he
made upon her: her lovingkindness in that she whom he attacked now
casts her shield in front of him and has received him under her wings, and
placed him in all security not resenting any of her former injuries, but most
lovingly opening her bosom to him. For this is more glorious than any kind
of trophy, this is a brilliant victory, this puts both Gentiles and Jews to
shame, this displays the bright aspect of the Church: in that having
received her enemy as a captive, she spares him, and when all have
despised him in his desolation, she alone like an affectionate mother has
concealed him under her cloak, opposing both the wrath of the king, and
the rage of the people, and their overwhelming hatred. This is an ornament
for the altar. A strange kind of ornament, you say, when the accused
sinner, the extortioner, the robber is permitted to lay hold of the altar.
Nay! say not so: for even the harlot took hold of the feet of Jesus, she
who was stained with the most accursed and unclean sin: yet her deed was
no reproach to Jesus, but rather redounded to His admiration and praise:
for the impure woman did no injury to Him who was pure, but rather was
the vile harlot rendered pure by the touch of Him who was the pure and
spotless one. Grudge not then, O man. We are the servants of the crucified
one who said "Forgive them for they know not what they do." But, you
say, he cut off the right of refuge here by his ordinances and divers kinds
of laws. Yes! yet now he has learned by experience what it was he did, and
he himself by his own deeds has been the first to break the law, and has
become a spectacle to the whole world, and silent though he is, he utters
from thence a warning voice to all, saying "do not such things as I have
done, that ye suffer not such things as I suffer." He appears as a teacher
by means of his calamity, and the altar emits great luster, inspiring now
the greatest awe from the fact that it holds the lion in bondage; for any
figure of royalty might be very much set off if the king were not only to be
seen seated on his throne arrayed in purple and wearing his crown, but if
also prostrate at the feet of the king barbarians with their hands bound
behind their backs were bending low their heads. And that no persuasive

arguments have been used, ye yourselves are witnesses of the enthusiasm,
and the concourse of the people. For brilliant indeed is the scene before us
to day, and magnificent the assembly, and I see as large a gathering here
today as at the Holy Paschal Feast. Thus the man has summoned you here
without speaking and yet uttering a voice through his actions clearer than
the sound of a trumpet: and ye have all thronged hither today, maidens
deserting their boudoirs, and matrons the women's chambers, and men the
market place that ye may see human nature convicted, and the instability
of worldly affairs exposed, and the harlot-face which a few days ago was
radiant (such is the prosperity derived from extortion) looking uglier than
any wrinkled old woman, this face I say you may see denuded of its
enamel and pigments by the action of adversity as by a sponge

4. Such is the force of this calamity: it has made one who was illustrious
and conspicuous appear the most insignificant of men. And if a rich man
should enter the assembly he derives much profit from the sight: for when
he beholds the man who was shaking the whole world, now dragged down
from so high a pinnacle of power, cowering with fright, more terrified than
a hare or a frog, nailed fast to yonder pillar, without bonds, his fear serving
instead of a chain, panic-stricken and trembling, he abates his haughtiness,
he puts down his pride, and having acquired the kind of wisdom
concerning human affairs which it concerns him to have he departs
instructed by example in the lesson which Holy Scripture teaches by
precept: - "All flesh is grass and all the glory of man as the flower of
grass: the grass withereth and the flower faileth" or "They shall wither
away quickly as the grass, and as the green herb shall they quickly fail" or
"like smoke are his days," and all passages of that kind. Again the poor
man when he has entered and gazed at this spectacle does not think
meanly of himself, nor bewail himself on account of his poverty, but feels
grateful to his poverty, because it is a place of refuge to him, and a calm
haven, and secure bulwark; and when he sees these things he would many
times rather remain where he is, than enjoy the possession of all men for a
little time and afterwards be in jeopardy of his own life. Seest thou how
the rich and poor, high and low, bond and free have derived no small profit
from this man's taking refuge here? Seest thou how each man will depart
hence with a remedy, being cured merely by this sight? Well! have I
softened your passion, and expelled your wrath? have I extinguished your

cruelty? have I induced you to be pitiful? Indeed I think I have; and your
countenances and the streams of tears you shed are proofs of it. Since then
your hard rock has turned into deep and fertile soil let us hasten to
produce some fruit of mercy, and to display a luxuriant crop of pity by
falling down before the Emperor or rather by imploring the merciful God
so to soften the rage of the Emperor, and make his heart tender that he
may grant the whole of the favor which we ask. For indeed already since
that day when this man fled here for refuge no slight change has taken
place; for as soon as the Emperor knew that he had hurried to this asylum,
although the army was present, and incensed on account of his misdeeds,
and demanded him to be given up for execution, the Emperor made a long
speech endeavoring to allay the rage of the soldiers, maintaining that not
only his offenses, but any good deed which he might have done ought to
be taken into account, declaring that he felt gratitude for the latter, and was
prepared to forgive him as a fellow creature for deeds which were
otherwise. And when they again urged him to avenge the insult done to the
imperial majesty, shouting, leaping, and brandishing their spears, he shed
streams of tears from his gentle eyes, and having reminded them of the
Holy Table to which the man had fled for refuge he succeeded at last in
appeasing their wrath.

5. Moreover let me add some arguments which concern ourselves. For
what pardon could you deserve, if the Emperor bears no resentment when
he has been insulted, but ye who have experienced nothing of this kind
display so much wrath? and how after this assembly has been dissolved
will ye handle the holy mysteries, and repeat that prayer by which we are
commanded to say "forgive us as we also forgive our debtors" when ye are
demanding vengeance upon your debtor? Has he inflicted great wrongs and
insults on you? I will not deny it. Yet this is the season not for judgment
but for mercy; not for requiring an account, but for showing loving
kindness: not for investigating claims but for conceding them; not for
verdicts and vengeance, but for mercy and favor. Let no one then be
irritated or vexed, but let us rather beseech the merciful God to grant him a
respite from death, and to rescue him from this impending destruction, so
that he may put off his transgression, and let us unite to approach the
merciful Emperor beseeching him for the sake of the Church, for the sake
of the altar, to concede the life of one man as an offering to the Holy

Table. If we do this the Emperor himself will accept us, and even before
his praise we shall have the approval of God, who will bestow a large
recompense upon us for our mercy. For as he rejects and hates the cruel
and inhuman, so does He welcome and love the merciful and humane man;
and if such a man be righteous, all the more glorious is the crown which is
wreathed for him: and if he be a sinner, He passes over his sins granting
this as the reward of compassion shown to his fellow-servant. "For" He
saith "I will have mercy and not sacrifice," and throughout the Scriptures
you find Him always enquiring after this, and declaring it to be the means
of release from sin. Thus then we shall dispose Him to be propitious to
us, thus we shall release ourselves from our sins, thus we shall adorn the
Church, thus also our merciful Emperor, as I have already said, will
commend us, and all the people will applaud us, and the ends of the earth
will admire the humanity and gentleness of our city, and all who hear of
these deeds throughout the world will extol us. That we then may enjoy
these good things, let us fall down in prayer and supplication, let us rescue
the captive, the fugitive, the suppliant from danger that we ourselves may
obtain the future blessings by the favor and mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom be glory and power, now and for ever, world without
end. Amen.

HOMILY 2

AFTER EUTROPIUS HAVING BEEN FOUND
OUTSIDE THE CHURCH HAD BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE

1. Delectable indeed are the meadow, and the garden, but far more
delectable the study of the divine writings. For there indeed are flowers
which fade, but here are thoughts which abide in full bloom; there is the
breeze of the zephyr, but here the breath of the Spirit: there is the hedge of
thorns, but here is the guarding providence of God; there is the song of
cicadae, but here the melody of the prophets: there is the pleasure which
comes from sight, but here the profit which comes from study. The garden
is confined to one place, but the Scriptures are in all parts of the world; the
garden is subject to the necessities of the seasons, but the Scriptures are
rich in foliage, and laden with fruit alike in winter and in summer. Let us
then give diligent heed to the study of the Scriptures: for if thou doest this
the Scripture will expel thy despondency, and engender pleasure, extirpate
vice, and make virtue take root, and in the tumult of life it will save thee
from suffering like those who are tossed by troubled waves. The sea rages
but thou sailest on with calm. weather; for thou hast the study of the
Scriptures for thy pilot; for this is the cable which the trials of life do not
break asunder. Now that I lie not events themselves bear witness. A few
days ago the Church was besieged: an army came, and fire issued from
their eyes, yet it did not scorch the olive tree; swords were unsheathed,
yet no one received a wound the imperial gates were in distress, but the
Church was in security. And yet the tide of war flowed hither; for here the
refugee was sought, and we withstood them, not fearing their rage. And
wherefore prithee? because we held as a sure pledge the saying "Thou art
Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church: and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it." And when I say the Church I mean not only a place
but also a plan of life: I mean not the walls of the Church but the laws of
the Church. When thou takest refuge in a Church, do not seek shelter
merely in the place but in the spirit of the place. For the Church is not
wall and roof but faith and life.

Do not tell me that the man having been surrendered was surrendered by
the Church if he had not abandoned the Church he would not have been
surrendered. Do not say that he fled here for refuge and then was given up:
the Church did not abandon him but he abandoned the Church. He was not
surrendered from within the Church but outside its walls. Wherefore did
he forsake the Church? Didst thou desire to save thyself? Thou shouldst
have held fast to the altar. There were no walls here, but there was the
guarding providence of God. Wast thou a sinner? God does not reject thee:
for "He came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance." The
harlot was saved when she clung to His feet. Have ye heard the passage
read today? Now I say these things that thou mayest not hesitate to take
refuge in the Church. Abide with the Church, and the Church does not
hand thee over to the enemy: but if thou fliest from the Church, the
Church is not the cause of thy capture. For if thou art inside the fold the
wolf does not enter: but if thou goest outside, thou art liable to be the wild
beast's prey: yet this is not the fault of the fold, but of thy own
pusillanimity. The Church hath no feet. Talk not to me of walls and arms:
for walls wax old with time, but the Church has no old age. Walls are
shattered by barbarians, but over the Church even demons do not prevail.
And that my words are no mere vaunt there is the evidence of facts. How
many have assailed the Church, and yet the assailants have perished while
the Church herself has soared beyond the sky? Such might hath the
Church: when she is assailed she conquers: when snares are laid for her she
prevails: when she is insulted her prosperity increases: she is wounded yet
sinks not under her wounds; tossed by waves yet not submerged; vexed
by storms yet suffers no shipwreck; she wrestles and is not worsted,
fights but is not vanquished. Wherefore then did she suffer this war to be?
That she might make more manifest the splendor of her triumph. Ye were
present on that day, and ye saw what weapons were set in motion against
her, and how the rage of the soldiers burned more fiercely than fire, and I
was hurried away to the imperial palace. But what of that? By the grace of
God none of those things dismayed me.

2. Now I say these things in order that ye too may follow my example.
But wherefore was I not dismayed? Because I do not fear any present
terrors. For what is terrible? Death? nay this is not terrible: for we
speedily reach the unruffled haven. Or spoliation of goods? "Naked came I

out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I depart;" or exile? "The earth
is the Lord's and the fullness thereof;" or false accusation? "Rejoice and be
exceeding glad, when men shall say all manner of evil against you falsely,
for great is your reward in Heaven." I saw the swords and I meditated on
Heaven; I expected death, and I bethought me of the resurrection; I beheld
the sufferings of this lower world, and I took account of the heavenly
prizes; I observed the devices of the enemy, and I meditated on the
heavenly crown: for the occasion of the contest was sufficient for
encouragement and consolation. True! I was being forcibly dragged away,
but I suffered no insult from the act; for there is only one real insult,
namely sin: and should the whole world insult thee, yet if thou dost not
insult thyself thou art not insulted. The only real betrayal is the betrayal
of the conscience: betray not thy own conscience, and no one can betray
thee. I was being dragged away and I saw the events - or rather I saw my
words turned into events, I saw my discourse which I had uttered in
words being preached in the market-place through the medium of actual
events. What kind of discourse? the same which I was always repeating.
The wind has blown and the leaves have fallen "The grass has withered
and the flower has faded." The night has departed and the day has dawned;
the shadow has been proved vain and the truth has appeared. They
mounted up to the sky, and they came down to the level of earth: for the
waves which were swelling high have been laid low by means of merely
human events. How? The things which were taking place were a lesson.
And I said to myself will posterity learn self-control? or before two days
have passed by will these events have been abandoned to oblivion? The
warnings were sounding in their ears. Again let me utter, yet again I will
speak. What profit will there be? Certainly there will be profit. For if all
do not hearken, the half will hearken; and if not the half, the third part: and
if not the third the fourth: and if not the fourth, perhaps ten: and if not
ten, perhaps five: and if not five perhaps one: and if not one, I myself have
the reward prepared for me. "The grass withereth and the flower fadeth;
but the word of God abideth for ever."

3. Have ye seen the insignificance of human affairs? have ye seen the
frailty of power? Have ye seen the wealth which I always called a
runaway and not a runaway only, but also a murderer. For it not only
deserts those who possess it, but also slaughters them; for when any one

pays court to it then most of all does it betray him. Why dost thou pay
court to wealth which today is for thee, and tomorrow for another? Why
dost thou court wealth which can never be held fast? Dost thou desire to
court it? dost thou desire to hold it fast? Do not bury it but give it into the
hands of the poor. For wealth is a wild beast: if it be tightly held it runs
away: if it be let loose it remains where it is; "For," it is said, "he hath
dispersed abroad and given to the poor; his righteousness remaineth
forever." Disperse it then that it may remain with thee; bury it not lest it
run away. Where is wealth? I would gladly enquire of those who have
departed. Now I say these things not by way of reproach, God forbid, nor
by way of irritating old sores, but as endeavoring to secure a haven for you
out of the shipwreck of others. When soldiers and swords were
threatening, when the city was in a blaze of fury, when the imperial
majesty was powerless, and the purple was insulted, when all places were
full of frenzy, where was wealth then? where was your silver plate? where
were your silver couches? where your household slaves? they had all
betaken themselves to flight; where were the eunuchs? they all ran away;
where were your friends? they changed their masks. Where were your
houses? they were shut up. Where was your money? the owner of it fled:
and the money itself, where was that? it was buried. Where was it all
hidden? Am I oppressive and irksome to you in constantly declaring that
wealth betrays those who use it badly? The occasion has now come which
proves the truth of my words. Why dost thou hold it so tightly, when in
the time of trial it profiteth thee nothing? If it has power when thou fallest
into a strait, let it come to thy aid, but if it then runs away what need hast
thou of it? events themselves bear witness. What profit was there in it?
The sword was whetted death was impending, an army raging: there was
apprehension of imminent peril; and yet wealth was nowhere to be seen.
Where did the runaway flee? It was itself the cause which brought about
all these evils, and yet in the hours of necessity it runs away. Nevertheless
many reproach me saying continually thou fasteneth upon the rich: while
they on the other hand fasten upon the poor. Well I do fasten upon the
rich: or rather not the rich, but those who make a bad use of their riches.
For I am continually saying that I do not attack the character of the rich
man, but of the rapacious. A rich man is one thing, a rapacious man is
another: an affluent man is one thing, a covetous man is another. Make
clear distinctions, and do not confuse things which are diverse. Art thou a

rich man? I forbid thee not. Art thou a rapacious man? I denounce thee.
Hast thou property of thy own? enjoy it. Dost thou take the property of
others? I will not hold my peace. Wouldest thou stone me for this? I am
ready to shed my blood: only I forbid thy sin. I heed not hatred, I heed not
war: one thing only do I heed, the advancement of my hearers. The rich are
my children, and the poor also are my children: the same womb has
travailed with both, both are the offspring of the same travail-pangs. If
then thou fastenest reproaches on the poor man, I denounce thee: for the
poor man does not suffer so much loss as the rich. For no great wrong is
inflicted on the poor man, seeing that in his case the injury is confined to
money; but in thy case the injury touches the soul. Let him who wills cast
me off, let him who wills stone me, let him who wills hate me: for the
plots of enemies are the pledges to me of crowns of victory, and the
number of my rewards will be as the number of my wounds.

4. So then I fear not an enemy's plots: one thing. only do I fear, which is
sin. If no one convicts me of sin, then let the whole world make war upon
me. For this kind of war only renders me more prosperous. Thus also do I
wish to teach you a lesson. Fear not the devices of a potentate, but fear
the power of sin. No man will do thee harm, if thou dost not deal a blow
to thyself. If thou hast not sin, ten thousand swords may threaten thee,
but God will snatch thee away out of their reach: but if thou hast sin, even
shouldest thou be in paradise thou wilt be cast out. Adam was in paradise
yet he fell; Job was on a dung hill, yet he was crowned victorious. What
profit was paradise to the one? or what injury was the dung hill to the
other? No man laid snares for the one, yet was he overthrown: the devil
laid snares for the other, and yet he was crowned. Did not the devil take
his property? Yes, but he did not rob him of his godliness. Did he not lay
violent hands upon his sons? yes: but he did not shake his faith. Did he
not tear his body to pieces? yes but he did not find his treasure. Did he
not arm his wife against him? yes but he did not overthrow the soldier.
Did he not hurl arrows and darts at him? yes but he received no wounds.
He advanced his engines but could not shake the tower; he conducted his
billows against him, but did not sink the ship. Observe this law I beseech
you, yea I clasp your knees, if not with the bodily hand, yet in spirit, and
pour forth tears of supplication. Observe this law I pray you, and no one
can do you harm. Never call the rich man happy; never call any man

miserable save him who is living in sin: and call him happy who lives in
righteousness. For it is not the nature of their circumstances, but the
disposition of the men which makes both the one and the other. Never be
afraid of the sword if thy conscience does not accuse thee: never be afraid
in war if thy conscience is clear. Where are they who have departed? tell
me. Did not all men once bow down to them? did not those who were in
authority tremble greatly before them? did they not pay court to them?
But sin has come, and all things are manifested in their true lights; they
who were attendants have become judges, the flatterers are turned into
executioners; they who once kissed his hands, dragged him themselves
from the church, and he who yesterday kissed his hand is today his
enemy. Wherefore? Because neither did he yesterday love him with
sincerity. For the opportunity came and the actors were unmasked. Didst
thou not yesterday kiss his hands, and call him savior, and guardian, and
benefactor? Didst thou not compose panegyrics without end? wherefore
today dost thou accuse him? Why yesterday a praiser, and today an
accuser? why yesterday utter panegyrics, and today reproaches? What
means this change? what means this revolution?

5. But I am not like this: I was the subject of his plots, yet I became his
protector. I suffered countless troubles at his hands, yet I did not retaliate.
For I copy the example of my Master, who said on the cross, "Forgive
them, for they know not what they do." Now I say these things that you
may not be perverted by the suspicion of wicked men. Now many changes
have taken place, since I had the oversight of the city, and yet no one
learns I self-control? But when I say no one, I do not condemn all, God
forbid. For it is impossible that this rich soil when it has received seed,
should not produce one eat; of corn: but I am insatiable, I do not wish
many to be saved but all. And if but one be left in a perishing condition, I
perish also, and deem that the Shepherd should be imitated who had
ninety-nine sheep, and yet hastened after the one which had gone astray.
How long will money last? how long this silver and gold? how long these
draughts of wine? how long the flatteries of slaves? how long these goblets
wreathed with garlands? how long these satanic drinking feasts, full of
diabolical activity?

Dost thou not know that the present life is a sojourn in a far country? for
art thou a citizen? Nay thou art a wayfarer. Understandest thou what I

say? Thou art not a citizen, but thou art a wayfarer, and a traveler. Say
not: I have this city and that. No one has a city. The city is above. Present
life is but a journey. We are journeying on every day, while nature is
running its course. Some there are who store up goods on the way: some
who bury jewelry on the road. Now when you enter an inn do you
beautify the inn? not so, but you eat and drink and hasten to depart. The
present life is an inn: we have entered it, and we bring present life to a
close: let us be eager to depart with a good hope, let us leave nothing here,
that we may not lose it there. When you enter the inn, what do you say to
the servant? Take care where you put away our things, that you do not
leave anything behind here, that nothing may be lost, not even what is
small and trifling, in order that we may carry everything back to our home.
Thou art a wayfarer and traveler, and indeed more insignificant than the
wayfarer. How so? I will tell you. The wayfarer knows when he is going
into the inn, and when he is going out; for the egress as well as the regress
is in his own power: but when I enter the inn, that is to say this present
life, I know not when I shall go out: and it may be that I am providing
myself with sustenance for a long time when the Master suddenly
summons me saying "Thou fool, for whom shall those things be which
thou hast prepared? for on this very night thy soul is being taken from
thee." The time of thy departure is uncertain, the tenure of thy
possessions insecure, there are innumerable precipices, and billows on
every side of thee. Why dost thou rave about shadows? why desert the
reality and run after shadows?

6. I say these things, and shall not cease saying them, causing continual
pain, and dressing the wounds; and this not for the sake of the fallen, but
of those who are still standing. For they have departed, and their career is
ended, but those who are yet standing have gained a more secure position
through their calamities. "What then," you say, "shall we do?" Do one
thing only, hate riches, and love thy life - cast away thy goods; I do not
say all of them, but cut off the superfluities. Be not covetous of other
men's goods, strip not the widow, plunder not the orphan, seize not his
house: I do not address myself to persons but to facts. But if any one's
conscience attacks him, he himself is responsible for it, not my words.
Why art thou grasping where thou bringest ill-will upon thyself? Grasp
where there is a crown to be gained. Strive to lay hold not of earth but of

heaven. "The kingdom of Heaven belongs to violent men and men of
violence take it by force." Why dost thou lay hold of the poor man who
reproaches thee? Lay hold of Christ who praises thee for it. Dost thou see
thy senselessness and madness? Dost thou lay hold of the poor man who
has little? Christ says "lay hold of me; I thank thee for it, lay hold of my
kingdom and take it by violence." If thou art minded to lay hold of an
earthly kingdom, or rather if thou art minded to have designs upon it thou
art punished; but in the case of the heavenly kingdom thou art punished if
thou dost not lay hold of it. Where worldly things are concerned there is
ill-will, but where spiritual there is love. Meditate daily on these things,
and if two days hence thou seest another riding in a chariot, arrayed in
raiment of silk, and elated with pride, be not again dismayed and troubled.
Praise not a rich man, but only him who lives in righteousness. Revile not
a poor man, but learn to have an upright and accurate judgment in all
things.

Do not hold aloof from the Church; for nothing is stronger than the
Church. The Church is thy hope, thy salvation, thy refuge. It is higher
than the heaven, it is wider than the earth. It never waxes old, but is
always in full vigor. Wherefore as significant of its solidity and stability
Holy Scripture calls it a mountain: or of its purity a virgin, or of its
magnificence a queen; or of its relationship to God a daughter; and to
express its productiveness it calls her barren who has born seven: in fact it
employs countless names to represent its nobleness. For as the master of
the Church has many names: being called the Father, and the way, and the
life, and the light, and the arm, and the propitiation, and the foundation,
and the door, and the sinless one, and the treasure, and Lord, and God, and
Son, and the only begotten, and the form of God, and the image of God so
is it with the Church itself: does one name suffice to present the whole
truth? by no means. But for this reason there are countless names, that we
may learn something concerning God, though it be but a small part. Even
so the Church also is called by many names. She is called a virgin, albeit
formerly she was an harlot: for this is the miracle wrought by the
Bridegroom, that He took her who was an harlot and hath made her a
virgin. Oh! what a new and strange event? With us marriage destroys
virginity, but with God marriage hath restored it. With us she who is a

virgin, when married, is a virgin no longer: with Christ she who is an
harlot, when married, becomes a virgin.

7. Let the heretic who inquires curiously into the nature of heavenly
generation saying "how did the Father beget the Son?" interpret this single
fact, ask him how did the Church, being an harlot, become a virgin? and
how did she having brought forth children remain a virgin? "For I am
jealous over you," saith Paul, "with a godly jealousy, for I espoused you
to one husband that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ." What
wisdom and understanding! "I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy."
What means this? "I am jealous," he says: art thou jealous seeing thou art a
spiritual man? I am jealous he says as God is. And hath God jealousy? yea
the jealousy not of passion, but of love, and earnest zeal. I am jealous over
you with the jealousy of God.

Shall I tell thee how He manifests His jealousy? He saw the world
corrupted by devils, and He delivered His own Son to save it. For words
spoken in reference to God have not the same force as when spoken in
reference to ourselves: for instance we say God is jealous, God is wroth,
God repents, God hates. These words are human, but they have a meaning
which becomes the nature of God. How is God jealous? "I am jealous over
you with the jealousy of God." Is God wroth? "O Lord reproach me not
in thine indignation." Doth God slumber? "Awake, wherefore sleepest
thou, O Lord?" Doth God repent? "I repent that I have made man." Doth
God hate? "My soul hateth your feasts and your new moons." Well do
not consider the poverty of the expressions: but grasp their divine
meaning. God is jealous, for He loves, God is wroth, not as yielding to
passion, but for the purpose of chastising, and punishing. God sleeps, not
as really slumbering, but as being long-suffering. Choose out the
expression. Thus when thou hearest that God begets the Son, think not of
division but of the unity of substance. For God has taken many of these
words from us as we also have borrowed others from Him, that we may
receive honor thereby.

8. Dost thou understand what I have said? Attend carefully my beloved.
There are divine names, and there are human names. God has received from
me, and He Himself hath given to me. Give me thine, and take mine He
says. Thou hast need of mine: I have no need of thine, but thou hast of

mine inasmuch as my nature is unmixed, but thou art a human being
encompassed with a body, seeking also corporeal terms in order that, by
borrowing expressions which are familiar to thee, thou who art thus
encompassed with a body, mayest be able to think on thoughts which
transcend thy understanding. What kind of names hath He received from
me, and what kind hath He given to me? He Himself is God, and He hath
called me God; with Him is the essential nature as an actual fact, with me
only the honor of the name: "I have said ye are gods, and ye are all
children of the most highest." Here are words, but in the other case there is
the actual reality. He hath called me God, for by that name I have received
honor. He Himself was called man, he was called Son of man, he was called
the Way, the Door, the Rock. These words He borrowed from me; the
others He gave from Himself to me. Wherefore was He called the Way?
That thou mightest understand that by Him we have access to the Father.
Wherefore was He called the Rock? that thou mightest understand the
secure and unshaken character of the faith. Wherefore was He called the
Foundation? That thou mightest understand that He upholdeth all things.
Wherefore was He called the Root? That thou mightest understand that in
Him we have our power of growth. Wherefore was He called the
Shepherd? Because He feeds us. Wherefore was He called a sheep?
Because He was sacrificed for us and became a propitiatory offering.
Wherefore was He called the Life? Because He raised us up when we were
dead. Wherefore was He called the Light? Because He delivered us from
darkness. Why was He called an Arm? Because He is of one substance
with the Father. Why was He called the Word? Because He was begotten
of the Father. For as my word is the offspring of my spirit, even so was
the Son begotten of the Father. Wherefore is He called our raiment?
Because I was clothed with Him when I was baptized. Why is He called a
table? Because I feed upon Him when I partake of the mysteries. Why is
He called a house? Because I dwell in Him. Why is He called an inmate of
the house? Because we become His Temple. Wherefore is He called the
Head? Because I have been made a member of His. Why is He called a
Bridegroom? Because He hath taken me as His bride. Wherefore is He
called undefiled? Because He took me as a virgin. Wherefore is He called
Master? Because I am His bondmaid.

9. For observe the Church, how, as I was saying, she is sometimes a bride,
sometimes a daughter, sometimes a virgin, sometimes a bondmaid,
sometimes a queen, sometimes a barren woman, sometimes a mountain,
sometimes a garden, sometimes fruitful in children, sometimes a lily,
sometimes a fountain: She is all things. Therefore having heard these
things, think not I pray you that they are corporeal; but stretch thy
thought further: for such things cannot be corporeal. For example: the
mountain is not the maid: the maid is not the bride: the queen is not the
bond-maid: yet the Church is all these things. Wherefore? because the
element in which they exist is not corporeal but spiritual. For in a
corporeal sphere these things are confined within narrow limits: but in a
spiritual sphere they have a wide field of operation. "The queen stood on
thy right hand." The queen? How did she who was down-trodden and
poor become a queen? and where did she ascend? the queen herself stood
on high by the side of the king. How? because the king became a servant;
He was not that by nature, but He became so. Understand therefore the
things which belong to the Godhead, and discern those which belong to the
Dispensation. Understand what He was, and what He became for thy
sake, and do not confuse things which are distinct, nor make the argument
of his lovingkindness an occasion for blasphemy. He was lofty, and she
was lowly: lofty not by position but by nature. His essence was pure, and
imperishable: His nature was incorruptble, unintelligible, invisible,
incomprehensible, eternal, unchangeable, transcending the nature of angels,
higher than the powers above, overpowering reason, surpassing thought,
apprehended not by sight but by faith alone. Angels beheld Him and
trembled, the Cherubim veiled themselves with their wings, in awe. He
looked upon the earth, and caused it to tremble: He threatened the sea and
dried it up: he brought rivers out of the desert: He weighed the mountains
in scales, and the valleys in a balance. How shall I express myself? how
shall I present the truth? His greatness hath no bounds, His wisdom is
beyond reckoning, His judgments are untraceable, His ways unsearchable.
Such is His greatness and His power, if indeed it is safe even to use such
expressions. But what am I to do? I am a human being and I speak in
human language: my tongue is of earth and I crave forgiveness from my
Lord. For I do not use these expressions in a spirit of presumption, but on
account of the poverty of my resources arising from my feebleness and the
nature of our human tongue. Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I utter these

words not in presumption but because I have no others: nevertheless I do
not rest content with the meanness of my speech, but soar upwards on the
wings of my understanding. Such is His greatness and power. I say this,
that without dwelling on the words, or on the poverty of the expressions,
thou mayest also thyself learn to act in the same way. Why dost thou
marvel if I do this, inasmuch as He also does the same, when He wishes to
present something to our minds which transcends human powers? Since
He addresses human beings He uses also human illustration, which are
indeed insufficient to represent the thing spoken of, and cannot exhibit the
full proportions of the matter, yet suffice for the infirmity of the hearers.

10. Make an effort, and do not grow weary of my prolonged discourse.
For as when He manifests Himself, He is not manifested as He really is,
nor is His bare essence manifested (for no man hath seen God in His real
nature; for when He is but partially revealed the Cherubim tremble - the
mountains smoke, the sea is dried up, the heaven is shaken, and if the
revelation were not partial who could endure it?) as then, I say, He does
not manifest Himself as He really is, but only as the beholder is able to see
Him, therefore doth He appear sometimes in the form of old age,
sometimes of youth, sometimes in fire, sometimes in air, sometimes in
water, sometimes in armor, not altering his essential nature, but fashioning
His appearance to suit the various condition of those who are affected by
it. In like manner also when any one wishes to say anything concerning
Him he employs human illustrations. For instance I say: He went up into
the mountain and He was transfigured before them, and His countenance
shone as the sun, and His raiment became white as snow." He disclosed, it
is said, a little of the Godhead, He manifested to them the God dwelling
amongst them "and He was transfigured before them." Attend carefully to
the statement. The writer says and He was transfigured before them, and
His raiment shone as the light, and His countenance was as the sun. When
I said "such is His greatness and power" and added "be merciful to ‘me O
Lord," (for I do not rest satisfied with the expression but am perplexed,,
having no other framed for the purpose) I wish you to understand, that I
learned this lesson from Holy Scripture. The evangelist then wished to
describe His splendor and he says "He shone" How did He shine? tell me.
Exceedingly. And how do you express this? He shone "as the sun." As the
sun sayest thou? Yea. Wherefore? Because I know not any other luminary

more brilliant. And He was white sayest thou as snow? wherefore as
snow? Because I know not any other substance which is whiter. For that
He did not really shine thus is proved by what follows: the disciples fell
to the ground. If he had shone as the sun the disciples would not have
fallen; for they saw the sun every day, and did not fall: but inasmuch as he
shone more brilliantly than the sun or snow, they, being unable to bear the
splendor, fell to the earth.

11. Tell me then, O evangelist, did He shine more brightly than the sun,
and yet dost thou say, "as the sun?" Yea: wishing to make that light
known to thee, I know not any other greater luminary, I have no other
comparison which holds a royal place amongst luminaries. I have said
these things that thou mayest not rest contentedly in the poverty of the
language used: I have pointed out to thee the fall of the disciples: they fell
to the earth, and were stupefied and overwhelmed with slumber. "Arise"
He said, and lifted them up, and yet they were oppressed. For they could
not endure the excessive brightness of that shining, but heavy sleep took
possession of their eyes: so far did the light which was manifested exceed
the light of the sun. Yet the evangelist said "as the sun," because that
luminary is familiar to us and surpasses all the rest.

But as I was saying, He who was thus great and powerful desired an
harlot. I speak of our human nature under that name. If a man indeed desire
an harlot he is condemned, and doth God desire one? Yea verily. Again a
man desireth an harlot that he may become a fornicator: but God that He
may convert the harlot into a virgin: so that the desire of the man is the
destruction of her who is desired: but the desire of God is salvation to her
who is desired. And why did He who is so great and powerful desire an
harlot? that He might become the husband thereof. How doth He act? He
doth not send to her any of His servants, He sendeth not angel, archangel,
Cherubim, or Seraphim; but He himself draws nigh Who loves her. Again
when thou hearest of love, deem it not sensuous. Cull out the thoughts
which are contained in the words, even as an excellent bee settles on the
flowers, and takes the honey comb, but leaves the herbs God desired an
harlot, and how doth He act? He does not conduct her on high; for He
would not bring an harlot into Heaven, but He Himself comes down. Since
she could not ascend on high, He descends to earth. He cometh to the
harlot, and is not ashamed: He cometh to her secret dwelling place. He

beholds her in her drunkenness. And how doth He come? not in the bare
essence of His original nature, but He becomes that which the harlot was,
not in intention but in reality does He become this, in order that she may
not be scared when she sees Him, that she may not rush away, and escape.
He cometh to the harlot, and becomes man. And how does He become
this? He is conceived in the womb, he increases little by little and follows
like me the course of human growth. Who is it who does this? the Deity as
manifested, not the Godhead; the form of the servant not that of the
Master; the flesh which belongs to me, not the essential nature which
belongs to Him: He increases little by little, and has intercourse with
mankind. Although He finds the harlot, human nature, full of sores,
brutalized, and oppressed by devils, how does He act? He draws nigh to
her. She sees Him and tees away. He calleth the wise men saying "Why
are ye afraid? I am not a judge, but a physician. "I came not to judge the
world but to save the world." Straightway He calleth the wise men. Oh!
new and strange event. The immediate first-fruits of His coming are wise
men. He who upholds the world lieth in a manger, and He who careth for
all things is a nursling in swaddling bands The temple is founded and the
God dwelleth therein. And wise men come and straightway worship Him:
the publican comes and is turned into an evangelist: the harlot comes and is
turned into a maiden: the Canaanitish woman comes and partakes of his
lovingkindness. This is the mark of one who loves, to forbear demanding
an account of sins, and to forgive transgressions and offenses. And how
does He act? He takes the sinner and espouses her to himself. And what
doth He give her? a signet ring. Of what nature? the Holy Spirit. Paul saith
"now He who establishment us with you is God who hath also sealed us,
and given the earnest of the Spirit." The Spirit then He giveth her. Next He
saith "Did not I plant thee in a garden?" She saith "yea?" And how didst
thou fall from thence? "The devil came and cast me out of the garden."
Thou wast planted in the garden and he cast thee out: behold I plant thee
in myself, I uphold thee. How? The devil dares not approach me. Neither
do I take thee up into Heaven; but something greater than Heaven is here: I
carry thee in myself who am the Lord of Heaven. The shepherd carries
thee and the wolf no longer comes: or rather I permit him to approach.
And so the Lord carrieth our nature: and the devil approaches and is
worsted. "I have planted thee in myself:" therefore He saith "I am the
root, ye are the branches:" so He planted her in Himself. "But," she saith,

"I am a sinner and unclean." "Let not this trouble thee, I am a physician. I
know my vessel, I know how it was perverted. It was formerly a vessel of
clay, and it was perverted. I remodel it by means of the layer of
regeneration and I submit it to the action of fire." For observe: He took
dust from the earth and made the man; He formed him. The devil came,
and perverted him. Then the Lord came, took him again, and remolded, and
recast him in baptism, and He suffered not his body to be of day, but
made it of a harder ware. He subjected the soft day to the fire of the Holy
Spirit. "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:" He was
baptized with water that he might be remodeled, with fire that he might be
hardened. Therefore the Prophet speaking beforehand under divine
guidance declared "Thou shalt dash them in pieces like vessels of the
potter." He did not say like vessels of earthenware which every one
possesses: for by a potter's vessels are meant those which the potter is
fashioning on the wheel: now the potter's vessels are of clay, but ours are
of harder ware. Speaking beforehand therefore of the remolding which is
wrought by means of baptism he saith, "thou shalt dash them in pieces
like vessels of a potter" - He means that He remodels and recasts them. I
descend into the ware of baptism, and the fashion of my nature is
remolded, and the fire of the Spirit recasts it, and it is turned into a harder
ware. And that my words are no empty vaunt hear what Job says, "He
hath made us as clay," and Paul, "but we have this treasure in earthen
vessels." But consider the strength of the earthen vessel was not shattered.
"A day and a night have I been in the deep." He hath been in the deep, and
the earthen vessel was not dissolved: he suffered shipwreck and the
treasure was not lost; the ship was submerged and yet the freight floated.
"But we have this treasure" he says. What kind of treasure? a supply of
the Spirit, righteousness, sanctification, redemption. Of what nature, tell
me? "in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk." "Aeneas, Jesus Christ
maketh thee whole" I say unto thee thou evil spirit, go out of him.

12. Hast thou seen a treasure more brilliant than royal treasures? For what
can the pearl of a king do like that which the words of an Apostle
effected? Set crowns innumerable upon dead men, and they will not be
raised: but one word went forth from an Apostle, and it brought back
revoked nature, and restored it to its ancient condition. "But we have this
treasure." O treasure which not only is preserved, but also preserves the

house where it is stored up. Dost thou understand what I have said? The
kings of the earth, and rulers when they have treasures, prepare large
houses, having strong walls, bars, doors, guards, and bolts in order that the
treasure may be preserved: but Christ did the contrary: He placed the
treasure not in a stone vessel but in an earthen one. If the treasure is great
wherefore is the vessel weak? But the reason why the vessel is weak is not
because the treasure is great; for this is not preserved by the vessel, but
itself preserves the vessel. I deposit the treasure: who is able henceforth to
steal it? The devil has come, the world has come, multitudes have come,
and yet they have not stolen the treasure: the vessel has been scourged,
yet the treasure was not betrayed; it has been drowned in the sea, yet the
treasure was not shipwrecked: it has died yet the treasure survives. He
gave therefore the earnest of the Spirit. Where are they who blaspheme the
Spirit's majesty? Give ye heed. "He that establisheth us with you in
Christ is God who also hath given the earnest of the Spirit." You all know
that the earnest is a small part of the whole; let me tell you how. Some one
goes to buy a house at a great price;;and he says "give me an earnest that I
may have confidence: or one goes to take a wife for himself, he arranges
about dowry and property, and he says "give me an earnest." Observe: in
the purchase of a slave and in all covenants there is an earnest. Since then
Christ made a covenant with us (for He was about to take me as a bride)
he also assigned a dowry to me not of money, but of blood. But this
dowry which He assigns is the bestowal of good things "such as eye hath
not seen, and ear hath not heard, neither hath entered into the heart of
man." He assigned them for the dowry: - immortality, praise with the
angels, release from death, freedom from sin, the inheritance of a kingdom
(so great are his riches), righteousness, sanctification, deliverance from
present evils, discovery of future blessings. Great was my dowry. Now
attend carefully: mark what He does. He came to take the harlot, for so I
call her, unclean as she was, that thou mightest understand the love of the
bridegroom. He came; He took me: He assigns me a dowry: He saith "I
give thee my wealth." How? "Hast thou lost," He saith, "paradise?" take
it back. Hast thou lost thy beauty? take it back; take all these things. But
yet the dowry was not given to me here.

13. Observe, this is the reason why He speaks beforehand with reference
to this dowry; He warranted to me in the dowry the resurrection of the

body, - immortality. For immortality does not always follow
resurrection, but the two are distinct. For many have risen, and been again
laid low, like Lazarus and the bodies of the saints. But in this case it is not
so, but the promise is of resurrection, immortality, a place in the joyful
company of angels, the meeting of the Son of Man in the clouds, and the
fulfillment of the saying "so shall we ever be with the Lord," the release
from death, the freedom from sin, the complete overthrow of destruction.
Of what kind is that? "Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have
entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them
that love Him." Dost thou give me good things which I know not? He saith
"yea; only be espoused to me here, love me in this world." "Wherefore
dost thou not give me the dowry here? "It will be given when thou hast
come to my Father, when thou hast entered the royal palace. Didst thou
come to me! nay I came to thee. I came not that thou shouldst abide here
but that I might take thee and return. Seek not the dowry here: all depends
on hope, and faith. "And dost thou give me nothing in this world?" He
answers "Receive an earnest that thou mayest trust me concerning that
which is to come: receive pledges and betrothal gifts." Therefore Paul saith
"I have espoused you." As gifts of betrothal God has given us present
blessings: they are an earnest of the future; but the full dowry abides in the
other world. How so? I will tell you. Here I grow old, there I grow not old;
here I die, there I die not, here I sorrow, there I sorrow not; here is
poverty, and disease, and intrigue, there nothing of that kind exits: here is
darkness and light, there is light alone: here is intrigue, there is liberty; here
is disease, there is health; here is life which has an end, there is life which
hath no end; here is sin, there is righteousness, and sin is banished; here is
envy, there nothing of the kind exists "Give me these things" one says;
"Nay! wait in order that thy fellow-servants also may be saved; wait I
say. He who establisheth us and hath given us the earnest" - what kind
of earnest? the Holy Spirit, the supply of the Spirit. Let me speak
concerning the Spirit. He gave the signet ring to the Apostles, saying "take
this and give it to all." Is the ring then portioned out, and yet not divided?
It is so. Let me teach you the meaning of the supply of the Spirit: Peter
received, and Paul also received the Holy Spirit. He went about the world,
he released sinners from their sins, he restored the lame, he clothed the
naked, he raised the dead, he cleansed the lepers, he bridled the devil, he
strangled the demons, he held converse with God, he planted a Church,

leveled temples to the earth, overturned altars, destroyed vice, established
virtue, made angels of men.

14. All these things we were. But "the earnest" filled the whole world.
And when I say the whole I mean all which the sun shines upon, sea,
islands, mountains, valleys, and hills. Paul went hither and thither, like
some winged creature, with one mouth only contending against the enemy,
he the tentmaker, who handled the workman's knife and sewed skins
together: and yet this his craft was no hindrance to his virtue, but the
tentmaker was stronger than demons, the uneloquent man was wiser than
the wise. Whence was this? He received the earnest, he bore the signet ring
and carried it about. All men saw that the King had espoused our nature:
the demon saw it and retreated, he saw the earnest, and trembled and
withdrew: he saw but the Apostle's garments and fled. O the power of the
Holy Spirit. He bestowed authority not on the soul, nor on the body, but
even on raiment; nor on raiment only but even on a shadow. Peter went
about and his shadow put diseases to flight, and expelled demons, and
raised the dead to life. Paul went about the world, cutting away the thorns
of ungodliness, sowing broadcast the seeds of godliness, like an excellent
ploughman handling the ploughshare of doctrine. And to whom did he go?
To Thracians, to Scythians, to Indians, to Maurians to Sardinians, to
Goths, to wild savages, and he changed them all. By what means? By
means of "the earnest." How was he sufficient for these things? By the
grace of the Spirit. Unskilled, ill-clothed, ill-shod he was upheld by Him
"who also hath given the earnest of the Spirit" Therefore he saith "and
who is sufficient for these things? But our sufficiency is of God, who hath
made us sufficient as ministers of the new Testament, not of the letter but
of the Spirit." Behold what the Spirit hath wrought: He found the earth
filled with demons and He has made it heaven. For meditate not on present
things but review the past in your thought. Formerly there was
lamentation, there were altars everywhere, everywhere the smoke and
fumes of sacrifice, everywhere unclean rites and mysteries, and sacrifices,
everywhere demons holding their orgies, everywhere a citadel of the devil,
everywhere fornication decked with wreaths of honor; and Paul stood
alone. How did he escape being overwhelmed, or torn in pieces? How
could he open his mouth? He entered the Thebaid, and made captives of
men, He entered the royal palace, and made a disciple of the king. He

entered the hall of judgment, and the judge saith to him "almost thou
persuadest me to become a Christian," and the judge became a disciple. He
entered the prison, and took the jailor captive. He visited an island of
barbarians, and made a viper the instrument of his teaching. He visited the
Romans, and attracted the senate to his doctrine. He visited rivers, and
desert places in all parts of the world. There is no land or sea which has
not shared in the benefits of his labors; for God has given human nature
the earnest of His signet, and when He gives it He saith: some things I give
thee now, and others I promise. Therefore the prophet saith concerning
her "The queen did stand upon thy right hand in a vesture woven with
gold." He does not mean a real vesture, but virtue. Therefore the Scripture
elsewhere saith "How camest thou in hither not having a wedding
garment?" so that here he does not mean a garment, but fornication, and
foul and unclean living. As then foul raiment signifies sin, so does golden
raiment signify virtue. But this raiment belonged to the king. He Himself
bestowed the raiment upon her: for she was naked, naked and disfigured.
"The queen stood on thy right hand in a vesture woven with gold." He is
speaking not of raiment but of virtue. Observe: the expression itself has
great nobility of meaning. He does not say "in a vesture of gold" but "in a
vesture woven with gold." Listen intelligently. A vesture of gold is one
which is gold throughout: but a vesture woven with gold is one which is
partly of gold, partly of silk. Why then did he say that the bride wore not
a vesture of gold, but one woven with gold? Attend carefully. He means
the constitution of the Church in its varied manifestations. For since we do
not all belong to one condition of life, but one is a virgin, another a widow,
a third lives a life of devotion - so the robe of the Church signifies the
constitution of the Church.

15. Inasmuch then as our Master knew that if He carved out only one road
for us, many must shrink from it, He carved out divers roads. Thou canst
not enter the kingdom it may be by the way of virginity. Enter it then by
the way of single marriage. Canst thou not enter it by one marriage?
Perchance thou mayest by means of a second marriage. Thou canst not
enter by the way of continence: enter then by the way of almsgiving: or
thou canst not enter by the way of almsgiving? then try the way of
fasting. If thou canst not use this way, take that - or if not that, then take
this. Therefore the prophet spoke not of a garment of gold, but of one

woven with gold. It is of silk, or purple, or gold. Thou canst not be a
golden part? then be a silken one. I accept thee, if only thou art clothed in
my raiment. Therefore also Paul saith "If any man builds upon this
foundation, gold, silver, previous stones." Thou canst not be the precious
stone? then be the gold. Thou canst not be the gold? then be the silver, if
only thou art resting upon the foundation. And again elsewhere, "there is
one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of
the stars." Thou canst not be a sun? then be a moon. Thou canst not be a
moon? then be a star. Thou canst not be a large star? be content to be a
tittle one if only thou art in the Heaven. Thou canst not be a virgin? then
live continently in the married state, only abiding in the Church. Thou
canst not be without possessions? then give alms, only abiding in the
Church, only wearing the proper raiment, only submitting to the queen.
The raiment is woven with gold, it is manifold in texture. I do not bar the
way against thee: for the abundance of virtues has rendered the
dispensation of the king easy in operation. "Clothed in a vesture woven
with gold, manifold in texture." Her vesture is manifold: unfold, if you
please, the deep meaning of the expression here used, and fix your eyes
upon this garment woven with gold. For here indeed some five celibate,
others live in an honorable estate of matrimony being not much inferior to
them: some have married once, others are widows in the flower of their
age. For what purpose is a paradise? and wherefore its variety? having
divers flowers, and trees, and many pearls. There are many stars, but only
one sun: there are many ways of living, but only one paradise; there are
many temples, but only one mother of them all. There is the body, the
eye, the finger. but all these make up but one man. There is the same
distinction between the small, the great, and the less. The virgin hath need
of the married woman; for the virgin also is the product of marriage, that
marriage may not be despised by her. The virgin is the root of marriage:
thus all things have been linked together, the small with the great, and the
great with the small. "The queen did stand on thy right hand clothed in a
vesture wrought with gold, manifold in texture" Then follows "Hearken! O
daughter" The conductor of the bride says that thou art about to go forth
from thy home to the home of the bridegroom who in his essential nature
far surpasses thee. I am the conductor of the bride. "Hearken O daughter"
Did she immediately become the wife? Yea: for here there is nothing
corporeal. For He espoused her as a wife, He loves her as a daughter, He

provides for her as a handmaid, He guards her as a virgin, He fences her
round like a garden, and cherishes her like a member: as a head He provides
for her, as a root he causes her to grow, as a shepherd He feeds her, as a
bridegroom He weds her, as a propitiation He pardons her, as a sheep He
is sacrificed, as a bridegroom He preserves her in beauty, as a husband He
provides for her support. Many are the meanings in order that we may
enjoy a part if it be but a small part of the divine economy of grace.
"Hearken O daughter" and behold, and look upon things which are bridal
and yet spiritual. Hearken O daughter. She was at first a daughter of
demons, a daughter of the earth, unworthy of the earth and now she has
become a daughter of the king. And this He wished who loved her. For he
who loves does not investigate character: love does not regard
uncomeliness: on this account indeed is it called love because it oftentimes
hath affection for an uncomely person. Thus also did Christ. He saw one
who was uncomely (for comely I could not call her) and He loved her, and
He makes her young, not having spot or wrinkle. Oh what a bridegroom!
adorning with grace the ungracefulness of his bride! Hearken O daughter!
hearken and behold! Two things He sixth "Hearken" and "Behold," two
which depend on thyself, one on thy eyes, the other on thy hearing. Now
since her dowry depended on hearing(and although some of you have been
acute enough to perceive this already, let them tarry for those who are
feebler: I commend those who have anticipated the truth, and make
allowances for those who only follow in their track) since the dowry then
depended on hearing - (and what is meant by heating? faith: for "faith
cometh by hearing" faith as opposed to fruition, and actual experience) I
said before that He divided the dowry into two, and gave some portion to
the bride for an earnest, whilst He promised others in the future. What did
He give her? He gave her forgiveness of sins, remission of punishment,
righteousness, sanctification, redemption, the body of the Lord, the divine,
spiritual Table, the resurrection of the dead. For all these things the
Apostles had. Therefore He gave some parts and promised others. Of
some there was experience and fruition, others depended upon hope and
faith. Now listen. What did He below? Baptism and the Sacrifice. Of these
there is experience. What did He promise? Resurrection, immortality of
the body, union with angels, a place in the joyful company of archangels,
and as a citizen in His kingdom, immaculate life, the good things "which

eye hath not seen, nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man,
things which God hath prepared for them that love Him."

16. Understand what is said, lest ye lose it: I am laboring to enable you to
perceive it. The dowry of the bride then was divided into two portions
consisting of things present and things to come; things seen and things
heard, things given and things taken on trust, things experienced, and
things to be enjoyed hereafter; things belonging to present life, and things
to come after the resurrection. The former things you see, the latter you
hear. Observe then what He says to her that you may not suppose that
she received the former things only, though they be great and ineffable, and
surpassing all understanding. "Hearken O daughter and behold;" hear the
latter things and behold the former that thou mayest not say "am I again to
depend on hope, again on faith, again on the future?" See now: I give some
things, and I promise others: the latter indeed depend on hope, but do thou
receive the others as pledges, as an earnest, as a proof of the remainder. I
promise thee a kingdom: and let present things be the ground of thy trust,
thy trust in me. Dost thou promise me a kingdom? Yea. I have given thee
the greater part, even the Lord of the kingdom, for "he who spared not his
own son, but gave him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely
give us all things?" Dost thou give me the resurrection of the body? Yea; I
have given thee the greater part. What is the nature of it? Release from
sins. How is that the greater part? Because sin brought forth death. I have
destroyed the parent, and shall I not destroy the offspring? I have dried up
the root, and shall I not destroy the produce. Hearken O daughter and
behold." What am I to behold? Dead men raised to life, lepers cleansed, the
sea restrained, the paralytic braced up into vigor, paradise opened, loaves
poured forth in abundance, sins remitted, the lame man leaping, the robber
made a citizen of paradise, the publican turned into an evangelist, the
harlot become more modest than the maid. Hear and behold. Hear of the
former things and behold these. Accept from present things a proof of the
others; concerning those I have given thee pledges, things which are better
than they are." "What is the meaning of this thy saying?" These things are
mine. "Hearken O daughter and behold." These things are my dower to
thee. And what doth the bride contribute? Let us see. What I pray thee
dost thou bring that thou mayest not be portionless? What can I, she
answers, bring to thee from heathen altars, and the steam of sacrifices and

from devils? What have I to contribute? what? sayest thou? Thy will and
thy faith. "Hearken O daughter and behold." And what wilt thou have me
do? "Forget thy own people." What kind of people? the devils the idols,
the sacrificial smoke, and steam and blood. "Forget thy own people, and
thy father's house." Leave thy father and come after me. I left my Father,
and came to thee, and wilt thou not leave thy father? But when the word
leave is used in reference to the Son do not understand by it an actual
leaving. What He means is "I condescended, I accommodated myself to
thee, I assumed human flesh." This is the duty of the bridegroom, and of
the bride, that thou shouldest abandon thy parents, and that we should be
wedded to one another. "Hearken O daughter and behold, and forget thy
own people, and thy father's house." And what dost thou give me if I do
forget them? "and the king shall desire thy beauty." Thou hast the Lord
for thy, lover. If thou hast Him for thy lover, thou hast also the things
which are his. I trust ye may be able to understand what is said: for the
thought is a subtle one, and I wish to stop the mouth of the Jews.

Now exert your minds I pray: for whether one hears, or forbears to hear I
shall dig and till the soil. "Hearken O daughter, and behold, forget also thy
own people, and thy fathers house, and the king shall desire thy beauty."
By beauty in this passage the Jew understands sensible beauty; not
spiritual but corporeal.

17. Attend, and let us learn what corporeal, and what spiritual beauty are.
There is soul and body: they are two substances: there is a beauty of
body, and there is a beauty of soul. What is beauty of body? an extended
eyebrow, a merry glance, a blushing cheek, ruddy lips, a straight neck, long
wavy hair tapering fingers, upright stature, a fair blooming complexion.
Does this bodily beauty come from nature, or from choice? Confessedly it
comes from nature. Attend that thou mayest learn the conception of
philosophers. This beauty whether of the countenance, of the eye, of the
hair, of the brow, does it come from nature, or from choice? It is obvious
that it comes from nature. For the ungraceful woman, even if she cultivate
beauty in countless ways, cannot become graceful in body: for natural
conditions are fixed, and confined by limits which they cannot pass over.
Therefore the beautiful woman is always beautiful, even if she has no taste
for beauty: and the ungraceful cannot make herself graceful, nor the
graceful ungraceful. Wherefore? because these things come from nature.

Well! thou hast seen corporeal beauty. Now let us turn inwards to the
soul: let the handmaid approach the mistress! let us turn I say to the soul.
Look upon that beauty, or rather listen to it: for thou canst not see it since
it is invisible - Listen to that beauty. What then is beauty of soul?
Temperance, mildness, almsgiving, love, brotherly kindness, tender
affection, obedience to God, the fulfillment of the law, righteousness,
contrition of heart. These things are the beauty of the soul. These things
then are not the results of nature, but of moral disposition. And he who
does not possess these things is able to receive them, and he who has
them, if he becomes careless, loses them. For as in the case of the body I
was saying that she who is ungraceful cannot become graceful; so in the
case of the soul I say the contrary that the graceless soul can become full
of grace. For what was more graceless than the soul of Paul when he was a
blashphemer and insulter: what more full of grace when he said "I have
fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith."
What was more graceless than the soul of the robber? what more full of
grace when he heard the words "Verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be
with me in paradise?" What was more graceless than the publican when he
practiced extortion? but what more full of grace when he declared his
resolution. Seest thou that thou canst not alter grace of body, for it is the
result not of moral disposition, but of nature. But grace of soul is supplied
out of our own moral choice. Thou hast now received the definition. Of
what kind are they? that the beauty of the soul proceeds from obedience
to God. For if the graceless soul obeys God it puts off its ungracefulness,
and becomes full of grace. "Saul! Saul!" it was said, "why persecutest thou
me?" and he replied "and who art Thou Lord?" "I am Jesus." And he
obeyed, and his obedience made the graceless soul full of grace. Again, He
saith to the publican "come follow me" and the publican rose up and
became an apostle: and the graceless soul became full of grace. Whence? by
obedience. Again He saith to the fishermen "Come ye after me and I will
make you to become fishers of men:" and by their obedience their minds
became full of grace. Let us see then what kind of beauty He is speaking of
here. "Hearken O daughter and behold, and forget thy own people and thy
fathers house, and the king shall desire thy beauty" What kind of beauty
will he desire? the spiritual kind. How so? because she is to "forget" He
saith "hearken and forget." These are acts of moral choice. "Hearken!" he
said: "an ungraceful one hears and her ungracefulness being that of the

body is not removed. To the sinful woman He has said "Hearken," and if
she will obey she sees what manner of beauty is bestowed upon her. Since
then the ungracefulness of the bride was not physical, but moral (for she
did not obey God but transgressed) therefore he leads her to another
remedy. Thou didst become ungraceful then, not by nature, but by moral
choice: and thou didst become full of grace by obedience. "Hearken O
daughter and behold and forget thy own people, and thy father's house,
and the king shall desire thy beauty." Then that thou mayest learn that he
does not mean anything visible to sense, when thou hearest the word
beauty, think not of eye, or nose, or mouth, or neck, but of piety, faith,
love, things which are within - "for all the glory of the king's daughter is
from within." Now for all these things let us offer thanks to God, the
giver, for to Him alone belongeth glory, honor, might, for ever and ever.
Amen.

INTRODUCTION TO THE TREATISE
THAT NO ONE CAN HARM THE MAN
WHO DOES NOT INJURE HIMSELF

THIS very beautiful treatise was composed when St. Chrysostom was in
exile, probably not long before his death, and was sent with a letter to his
great friend the deacconess Olympias in Constantinople.

Plato in the 10th book of his Dialogue called the "Republic: employs an
argument to prove the immorality of the soul, so nearly resembling a
portion of this treatise that I can scarcely doubt St. Chrysostom had it in
his mind. The following is the passage in the Platonic dialogue as rendered
in the excellent translation of Messrs. Davies & Vaughan. I omit a few
sentences here and there.

"Have you not learned, I asked, that our soul is immortal and never dies?

He looked at me and said in amazement. No really I have not: but can you
maintain this doctrine?

Yes as I am an honest man, I replied, and I think you could also. It is quite
easy to do it.

Proceed by all means.

So you call one thing good and another evil?

I do.

And do we hold the same opinion as to the meaning of the two terms?

What opinion do you hold?

I hold that the term evil comprises everything that destroys and corrupts,
and the term good everything that preserves and benefits.

So do I.

Again; do you maintain that everything has its evil and its good? Do you
say for example that the eyes are liable to the evil of ophthalmia, the entire
body to disease corn is liable to some connatural evil and malady?

I do.

And is it not the case that, whenever an object is attacked by one of these
maladies it is impaired; and in the end completely broken up and
destroyed by it?

Doubtless it is so?

Hence everything is destroyed by its own connatural evil and vice:
otherwise if it be not destroyed by this, there is nothing else that can
corrupt it. For that which is good will never destroy anything, nor yet that
which is neither good nor evil.

Of course not.

If then we can find among existing things one which is liable to a particular
evil which can indeed mar it, but cannot break it up or destroy it, shall we
not be at once certain that a thing so constituted can never perish?

That would be a reasonable conclusion.

Well then is not the soul liable to a malady which renders it evil?

Certainly it is: all these things which we were lately discussing -
injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and ignorance - produce that result."

Then having proved that although these things injure the soul they do not
actually destroy it he proceeds.

"Well, it is irrational to suppose that a thing can be destroyed by the
depravity of another thing, though it cannot be destroyed by it own.

True it is irrational.

Yes it is: for you must remember that we do not imagine that a body is to
be destroyed by the proper depravity of its food whatever that may be,
whether mouldiness or rottenness or anything else. But if the depravity of
the food itself produces in the body a disorder proper to the body, we
shall assert that the body has been destroyed by its food remotely, but by
its own proper vice or disease, immediately: and we shall always disclaim
the notion that the body can be corrupted by the depravity of its food
which is a different thing from the body - that is to say, the notion that

the body can be corrupted by an alien evil without the introduction of its
own native evil.

You are perfectly correct.

Then according to the same reasoning I continued, unless depravity of
body introduces into the soul depravity of soul let us never suppose that
the soul can be destroyed by an alien evil without the presence of its own
peculiar disease: for that would be to suppose that one thing can be
destroyed by the evil of another thing.

That is the reasonable statement.

Well then let us either refute this doctrine and point out our mistake or
else, so long as it remains unrefuted, let us never assert that a fever or any
other disease, or fatal violence, or even the act of cutting up the entire
body into the smallest possible pieces can have any tendency to destroy
the soul, until it has been demonstrated that in consequence of this
treatment of the body the soul itself becomes more unjust and more
unholy. For so long as a thing is exempt from its own proper evil, while an
evil foreign to it appears in another subject, let us not allow it to be said
that this thing whether it be a soul or anything else is in danger of being
destroyed.

Well, certainly no one will ever prove that the soul of the dying become
more unjust in consequence of earth." Here follows a passage to prove that
even injustice does not destroy the soul, after which he proceeds.

"Surely then when the soul cannot be killed and destroyed by its own
depravity and its own evil, hardly will the evil which is charged with the
destruction of another thing destroy a soul or anything else beyond its
own appropriate object.

Hardly: at least that is the natural inference.

Hence, as it is destroyed by no evil at all, whether foreign to it or its own,
it is clear that the soul must be always existing, and therefore immortal.

It must.

If any one will compare this extract with chapter 2 to 6 in the following
treatise he cannot fail to be struck by the similarity of thought and

language, although in the latter case it is more apparent in the original than
it can be in a translation. The aim of the two writers is not indeed identical:
Chrysostom's object is to prove that nothing can really injure a man
except sin - depravity of soul - Plato begins by proving this, and
proceeds to maintain that if even that which corrupts the soul cannot
actually destroy it, the soul must be imperishable. They employ the same
argument, only Plato carries it a step further than Chrysostom.

A TREATISE

TO PROVE THAT NO ONE CAN HARM THE MAN WHO DOES
NOT INJURE HIMSELF

1. I KNOW well that to coarse-minded persons, who are greedy in the
pursuit of present things, and are nailed to earth, and enslaved to physical
pleasure, and have no strong hold upon spiritual ideas, this treatise will be
of a strange and paradoxical kind: and they will laugh immoderately, and
condemn me for uttering incredible things from the very outset of my
theme. Nevertheless, I shall not on this account desist from my promise,
but for this very reason shall proceed with great earnestness to the proof
of what I have undertaken. For if those who take that view of my subject
will please not to make a clamor and disturbance, but wait to the end of
my discourse, I am sure that they will take my side, and condemn
themselves, finding that they have been deceived hitherto, and will make a
recantation, and apology, and crave pardon for the mistaken opinion which
they held concerning these matters, and will express great gratitude to me,
as patients do to physicians, when they have been relieved from the
disorders which lay siege to their body. For do not tell me of the judgment
which is prevailing in your mind at the present time, but wait to hear the
contention of my arguments and then you will be able to record an
impartial verdict without being hindered by ignorance from forming a true
judgment. For even judges in secular causes, if they see the first orator
pouring forth a mighty torrent of words and overwhelming everything
with his speech do not venture to record their decision without having
patiently listened to the other speaker who is opposed to him; and even if
the remarks of the first speaker seem to be just to an unlimited extent,
they reserve an unprejudiced hearing for the second. In fact the special
merit of judges consists in ascertaining with all possible accuracy what
each side has to allege and then bringing forward their own judgment.

Now in the place of an orator we have the common assumption of
mankind which in the course of ages has taken deep root in the minds of
the multitude, and declaims to the following effect throughout the world.
"All things" it says "have been turned upside down, the human race is full

of much confusion and many are they who every day are being wronged,
insulted, subjected to violence and injury, the weak by the strong, the poor
by the rich: and as it is impossible to number the waves of the sea, so is it
impossible to reckon the multitude of those who are the victims of
intrigue, insult, and suffering; and neither the correction of law, nor the fear
of being brought to trial, nor anything else can arrest this pestilence and
disorder, but the evil is increasing every day, and the groans, and
lamentations, and weeping of the sufferers are universal; and the judges
who are appointed to reform such evils, themselves intensify the tempest,
and inflame the disorder, and hence many of the more senseless and
despicable kind, seized with a new kind of frenzy, accuse the providence
of God, when they see the forbearing man often violently seized, racked,
and oppressed, and the audacious, impetous, low and low-born man
waxing rich, and invested with authority, and becoming formidable to
many, and inflicting countless troubles upon the more moderate, and this
perpetrated both in town and country, and desert, on sea and land. This
discourse of ours of necessity comes in by way of direct opposition to
what has been alleged, maintaining a contention which is new, as I said at
the beginning, and contrary to opinion, yet useful and true, and profitable
to those who will give heed to it and be persuaded by it; for what I
undertake is to prove (only make no commotion) that no one of those who
are wronged is wronged by another, but experiences this injury at his own
hands.

2. But in order to make my argument plainer, let us first of all enquire
what injustice is, and of what kind of things the material of it is wont to be
composed; also what human virtue is, and what it is which ruins it; and
further what it is which seems to ruin it but really does not. For instance
(for I must complete my argument by means of examples) each thing is
subject to one evil which ruins it; iron to rust, wool to moth, flocks of
sheep to wolves. The virtue of wine is injured when it ferments and turns
sour: of honey when it loses its natural sweetness, and is reduced to a
bitter juice. Ears of corn are ruined by mildew and droughts and the fruit,
and leaves, and branches of vines by the mischievous host of locusts, other
trees by the caterpillar, and irrational creatures by diseases of various
kinds: and not to lengthen the list by going through all possible examples,
our own flesh is subject to fevers, and palsies, and a crowd of other

maladies. As then each one of these things is liable to that which ruins its
virtue, let us now consider what it is which injures the human race, and
what it is which ruins the virtue of a human being. Most men think that
there are divers things which have this effect; for I must mention the
erroneous opinions on the subject, and, after confuting them, proceed to
exhibit that which really does ruin our virtue: and to demonstrate clearly
that no one could inflict this injury or bring this ruin upon us unless we
betrayed ourselves. The multitude then having erroneous opinions imagine
that there are many different things which ruin our virtue: some say it is
poverty, others bodily disease, others loss of property, others calumny,
others death and they are perpetually bewailing and lamenting these
things: and whilst they are commiserating the sufferers and shedding tears
they excitedly exclaim to one another "What a calamity has befallen such
and such a man! he has been deprived of all his fortune at a blow." Of
another again one will say: "such and such a man has been attacked by
severe sickness and is despaired of by the physicians in attendance." Some
bewail and lament the inmates of the prison, some those who have been
expelled from their country n and transported to the land of exile, others
those who have been deprived of their freedom, others those who have
been seized and made captives by enemies, others those who have been
drowned, or burnt, or buried by the fall of a house, but no one mourns
those who are living in wickedness: on the contrary, which is worse than
all, they often congratulate them, a practice which is the cause of all
manner of evils. Come then (only, as I exhorted you at the outset, do not
make a commotion), let me prove that none of the things which have been
mentioned injure the man who lives soberly, nor can ruin his virtue. For
tell me if a man has lost his all either at the hands of calumniators or of
robbers, or has been stripped of his goods by knavish servants, what harm
has the loss done to the virtue of the man?

But if it seems well let me rather indicate in the first place what is the
virtue of a man, beginning by dealing with the subject in the case of
existences of another kind so as to make it more intelligible and plain to the
majority of readers.

3. What then is the virtue of a horse? is it to have a bridle studded with
gold and girths to match, and a band of silken threads to fasten the
housing, and clothes wrought in divers colors and gold tissue, and head

gear studded with jewels, and locks of hair plaited with gold cord? or is it
to be swift and strong in its legs, and even in its paces, and to have hoofs
suitable to a well bred horse, and courage fitted for long journies and
warfare, and to be able to behave with calmness in the battle field, and if a
rout takes place to save its rider? Is it not manifest that these are the
things which constitute the virtue of the horse, not the others? Again,
what should you say was the virtue of asses and mules? is it not the
power of carrying burdens with contentment, and accomplishing journies
with ease, and having hoofs like rock? Shall we say that their outside
trappings contribute anything to their own proper virtue? By no means.
And what kind of vine shall we admire? one which abounds in leaves and
branches, or one which is laden with fruit? or I what kind of virtue do we
predicate of an olive? is it to have large boughs, and great luxuriance of
leaves, or to exhibit an abundance of its proper fruit dispersed over all
parts of the tree? Well, let us act in the same way in the case of human
beings also: let us determine what is the virtue of man, and let us regard
that alone as an injury, which is destructive to it. What then is the virtue
of man? not riches that thou shouldest fear poverty: nor health of body
that thou shouldest dread sickness, nor the opinion of the public, that thou
shouldest view an evil reputation with alarm, nor life simply for its own
sake, that death should be terrible to thee: nor liberty that thou shouldest
avoid servitude: but carefulness in holding true doctrine, and rectitude in
life. Of these things not even the devil himself will be able to rob a man, if
he who possesses them guards them with the needful carefulness: and that
most malicious and ferocious demon is aware of this. For this cause also he
robbed Job of his substance, not to make him poor, but that he might force
him into uttering some blasphemous speech; and he tortured his body, not
to subject him to infirmity, but to upset the virtue of his soul. But
nevertheless when he had set all his devices in motion, and turned him
from a rich man into a poor one (that calamity which seems to us the most
terrible of all), and had made him childless who was once surrounded by
many children, and had scarified his whole body more cruelly than the
executioners do in the public tribunals (for their nails do not lacerate the
sides of those who fall into their hands so severely as the gnawing of the
worms lacerated his body), and when he had fastened a bad reputation
upon him (for Job's friends who were present with him said "thou hast
not received the chastisement which thy sins deserve," and directed many

words of accusation against him), and after he had not merely expelled him
from city and home and transferred him to another city, but had actually
made the dunghill serve as his home and city; after all this, he not only did
him no damage but rendered him more glorious by the designs which he
formed against him. And he not only failed to rob him of any of his
possessions although he had robbed him of so many things, but he even
increased the wealth of his virtue. For after these things he enjoyed greater
confidence inasmuch as he had contended in a more severe contest. Now if
he who underwent such sufferings, and this not at the hand of man, but at
the hand of the devil who is more wicked than all men, sustained no injury,
which of those persons who say such and such a man injured and damaged
me will have any defense to make in future? For if the devil who is full of
such great malice, after having set all his instruments in motion, and
discharged all his weapons, and poured out all the evils incident to man, in
a superlative degree upon the family and the person of that righteous man
nevertheless did him no injury, but as I was saying rather profited him:
how shall certain be able to accuse such and such a man alleging that they
have suffered injury at their hands, not at their own?

4. What then? some one will say, did he not inflict injury on Adam, and
upset him, and cast him out of paradise? No: he did it not, but the cause
was the listlessness of him who was injured, and his want of temperance
and vigilance. For he who applied such powerful and manifold devices and
yet was not able to subdue Job, how could he by inferior means have
mastered Adam, had not Adam betrayed himself through his own
listlessness? What then? Has not he been injured who has been exposed to
slander, and suffered confiscation of his property, having been deprived of
all his goods, and is thrown out of his patrimony, and struggles with
extreme poverty? No! he has not been injured, but has even profited, if he
be sober. For, tell me, what harm did this do the apostles? Were they not
continually struggling with hunger, and thirst and nakedness? And this was
the very reason why they were so illustrious, and distinguished, and won
for themselves much help from God. Again what harm was done to
Lazarus by his disease, and sores, and poverty and dearth of protectors?
Were they not the reasons why garlands of victory were more abundantly
woven for him? Or what harm was done to Joseph by his getting evil
reported of, both in his own land, and in the land of strangers? for he was

supposed to be both an adulterer and fornicator: or what harm did
servitude do him or expatriation? Is it not specially on account of these
things that we regard him with admiration and astonishment? And why do
I speak of removal into a foreign land, and poverty, and evil report, and
bondage? For what harm did death itself inflict on Abel, although it was a
violent and untimely death, and perpetrated by a brother's hand? Is not
this the reason why his praise is sounded throughout the whole world?
Seest thou how the discourse has demonstrated even more than it
promised? For not only has it disclosed the fact that no one is injured by
anybody, but also that they who take heed to themselves derive the
greater gain (from such assaults). What is the purpose then it will be said
of penalties and punishments? What is the purpose of hell? What is the
purpose of such great threatenings, if no one is either injured or injures?
What is it thou sayest? Why dost thou confuse the argument? For I did
not say that no one injures, but that no one is injured. And how is it
possible, you will say, for no one to be injured when many are committing
injury? In the way which I indicated just now. For Joseph's brethren did
indeed injure him, yet he himself was not injured: and Cain laid snares for
Abel, yet he himself was riot ensnared. This is the reason why there are
penalties and punishments. For God does not abolish penalties on account
of the virtue of those who suffer; but he ordains punishments on account
of the malice of those who do wickedly. For although they who are evil
entreated become more illustrious in consequence of the designs formed
against them, this is not due to the intention of those who plan the
designs, but to the courage of those who are the victims of them.
Wherefore for the latter the rewards of philosophy are made ready and
prepared, for the former the penalties of wickedness. Hast thou been
deprived of thy money? Read the word "Naked came I out of my
mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither." And add to this the
apostolic saying "for we brought nothing into this world; it is certain we
can carry nothing out." Art thou evil reported of, and have some men
loaded thee with countless abuse? Remember that passage where it is said
"Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you" and "rejoice ye and
leap for joy when they shall cast upon you an evil name." Hast thou been
transported into the land of exile? Consider that thou hast not here a
fatherland, but that if thou wilt be wise thou art bidden to regard the whole
world as a strange country. Or hast thou been given over to a sore disease?

quote the apostolic saying "the more our outward man decayeth, so much
the more is the inward man renewed day by day." Has any one suffered a
violent death? consider the case of John, his head cut off in prison, carried
in a charger, and made the reward of a harlot's dancing. Consider the
recompense which is derived from these things: for all these sufferings
when they are unjustly inflicted by any one on another, expiate sins, and
work righteousness. So great is the advantage of them in the case of those
who bear them bravely.

5. When then neither loss of money, nor slander, nor railing, nor
banishment, nor diseases, nor tortures, nor that which seems more
formidable than all, namely death, harms those who suffer them, but rather
adds to their profit, whence can you prove to me that any one is injured
when he is not injured at all from any of these things? For I will endeavor
to prove the reverse, showing that they who are most injured and insulted,
and suffer the most incurable evils are the persons who do these things.
For what could be more miserable than the condition of Cain, who dealt
with his brother in this fashion? what more pitiable than that of Phillip's
wife who beheaded John? or the brethren of Joseph who sold him away,
and transported him into the land of exile? or the devil who tortured Job
with such great calamities? For not only on account of his other iniquities,
but at the same time also for this assault he will pay no trifling penalty.
Dost thou see how here the argument has proved even more than was
proposed, shewing that those who are insulted not only sustain no harm
from these assaults, but that the whole mischief recoils on the head of
those who contrive them? For since neither wealth nor freedom, nor life in
our native land nor the other things which I have mentioned, but only right
actions of the soul, constitute the virtue of man, naturally when the harm
is directed against these things, human virtue itself is no wise harmed.
What then? supposing some one does harm the moral condition of the
soul? Even then if a man suffers damage, the damage does not come from
another but proceeds from within, and from the man himself. "How so,"
do you say? When any one having been beaten by another, or deprived of
his goods, or having endured some other grievous insult, utters a
blasphemous speech, he certainly sustains a damage thereby, and a very
great one, nevertheless it does not proceed from him who has inflicted the
insult, but from his own littleness of soul. For what I said before I will

now repeat, no man if he be infinitely wicked could attack any one more
wickedly or more bitterly than that revengeful demon who is implacably
hostile to us, the devil: but yet this cruel demon had not power to upset or
overthrow him who lived before the law, and before the time of grace,
although he discharged so many and such bitter weapons against him from
all quarters. Such is the force of nobility of soul. And what shall I say of
Paul? Did he not suffer so many distresses that even to make a list of them
is no easy matter? He was put in prison, loaded with chains, dragged
hither and hither, scourged by the Jews, stoned, lacerated on the back not
only by thongs, but also by rods, he was immersed in the sea, oftentimes
beset by robbers, involved in strife with his own countrymen, continually
assailed both by foes and by acquaintance, subjected to countless
intrigues, struggling with hunger and nakedness, undergoing other frequent
and lasting mischances and afflictions: and why need I mention the greater
part of them? he was dying every day: but yet, although subjected to so
many and such grievous sufferings, he not only uttered no blasphemous
word, but rejoiced over these things and gloried in them: and one time he
says "I rejoice in my sufferings," and then again "not only this but we also
glory in afflictions." If then he rejoiced and gloried when suffering such
great troubles what excuse will you have, and what defense will you make
if you blaspheme when you do not undergo the smallest fraction of them.

6. But I am injured in other ways, one will say, and even if I do not
blaspheme, yet when I am robbed of my money I am disabled from giving
alms. This is a mere pretext and pretense. For if you grieve on this account
know certainly that poverty is no bar to almsgiving. For even if you are
infinitely poor you are not poorer than the woman who possessed only a
handful of meal, and the one who had only two mites, each of whom
having spent all her substance upon those who were in need was an object
of surpassing admiration: and such great poverty was no hindrance to such
great lovingkindness, but the alms bestowed from the two mites was so
abundant and generous as to eclipse all who had riches, and in wealth of
intention and superabundance of zeal to surpass those who cast in much
coin. Wherefore even in this matter thou art not injured but rather
benefited, receiving by means of a small contribution rewards more
glorious than they who put down large sums. But since, if I were to say
these things for ever, sensuous characters which delight to grovel in

worldly things, and revel in present things would not readily endure
parting from the fading flowers (for such are the pleasant things of this
life) or letting go its shadows: but the better sort of men indeed cling to
both the one and the other, while the more pitiable and abject cling more
strongly to the former than to the latter, come let usstrip off the pleasant
and showy masks which hide the base and ugly countenance of these
things, and let us expose the foul deformity of the harlot. For such is the
character of a life of this kind which is devoted to luxury, and wealth and
power: it is foul and ugly and full of much abomination, disagreeable and
burdensome, and charged with bitterness. For this indeed is the special
feature in this life which deprives those who are captivated by it of every
excuse, that although it is the aim of their longings and endeavors, yet is it
filled with much annoyance and bitterness, and teems with innumerable
evils, dangers, bloodshed, precipices, crags, murders, fears and tremblings,
envy and ill-will, and intrigue, perpetual anxiety and care, and derives no
profit, and produces no fruit from these great evils save punishment and
revenge, and incessant torment. But although this is its character it seems
to be to most men an object of ambition, and eager contention, which is a
sign of the folly of those who are captivated by it, not of the blessedness
of the thing itself. Little children indeed are eager and excited about toys
and cannot take notice of the things which become full grown men. There
is an excuse for them on account of their immaturity: but these others are
debarred from the right of defense, because, although of full age they are
childish in disposition, and more foolish than children in their manner of
life.

Now tell me why is wealth an object of ambition? For it is necessary to
start from this point, because to the majority of those who are afflicted
with this grievous malady it seems to be more precious than health and
life, and public reputation, and good opinion, and country, and household,
and friends, and kindred and everything else. Moreover the flame has
ascended to the very clouds: and this fierce heat has taken possession of
land and sea. Nor is there any one to quench this fire: but all people are
engaged in stirring it up, both those who have been already caught by it,
and those who have not yet been caught, in order that they may be
captured. And you may see every one, husband and wife, household slave,
and freeman, rich and poor, each according to his ability carrying loads

which supply much fuel to this fire by day and night: loads not of wood
or faggots (for the fire is not of that kind), but loads of souls and bodies, of
unrighteousness and iniquity. For such is the material of which a fire of
this kind is wont to be kindled. For those who have riches place no limit
anywhere to this monstrous passion, even if they compass the whole
world: and the poor press on to get in advance of them, and a kind of
incurable craze, and unrestrainable frenzy and irremediable disease
possesses the souls of all. And this affection has conquered every other
kind and thrust it away expelling it from the soul: neither friends nor
kindred are taken into account: and why do I speak of friends and kindred?
not even wife and children are regarded, and what can be dearer to man
than these? but all things are dashed to the ground and trampled underfoot,
when this savage and inhuman mistress has laid hold of the souls of all
who are taken captive by her. For as an inhuman mistress, and harsh
tyrant, and savage barbarian, and public and expensive prostitute she
debases and exhausts and punishes with innumerable dangers and torments
those who have chosen to be in bondage to her; and yet although she is
terrible and harsh, and fierce and cruel, and has the face of a barbarian, or
rather of a wild beast, fiercer than a wolf or a lion, she seems to those who
have been taken captive by her gentle and lovable, and sweeter than honey.
And although she forges swords and weapons against them every day, and
digs pitfalls and leads them to precipices and crags and weaves endless
snares of punishment for them, yet is she supposed to make these things
objects of ambition to those who have been made captive, and those who
are desiring to be captured. And just as a sow delights and revels in
wallowing in the ditch and mire, and beetles delight in perpetually crawling
over dung; even so they who are captivated by the love of money are more
miserable than these creatures. For the abomination is greater in this case,
and the mire more offensive: for they who are addicted to this passion
imagine that much pleasure is derived from it: which does not arise from
the nature of the thing, but of the understanding which is afflicted with
such an irrational taste. And this taste is worse in their case than in that of
brutes: for as with the mire and the dung the cause of pleasure is not in
them, but in the irrational nature of the creatures who plunge into it; even
so count it to be in the case of human beings.

7. And how might we cure those who are thus disposed? It would be
possible if they would open their ears to us, and unfold their heart, and
receive our words. For it is impossible to turn and divert the irrational
animals from their unclean habit; for they are destitute of reason: but this
the gentlest of all tribes, honored by reason and speech, I mean human
nature, might, if it chose, readily and easily be released from the mire and
the stench, and the dung hill and its abomination. For wherefore, O man,
do riches seem to thee worthy such diligent pursuit? Is it on account of the
pleasure which no doubt is derived from the table? or on account of the
honor and the escort of those who pay court to thee, because of thy
wealth? is it because thou art able to defend thyself against those who
annoy thee, and to be an object of fear to all? For you cannot name any
other reasons, save pleasure and flattery, and fear, and the power of taking
revenge; for wealth is not generally wont to make any one wiser, or more
self-controlled, or more gentle, or more intelligent, or kind, or benevolent,
or superior to anger, or gluttony or pleasure: it does not train any one to
be moderate, or teach him how to be humble, nor introduce and implant
any other piece of virtue in the soul. Neither could you say for which of
these things it deserves to be so diligently sought and desired. For not only
is it ignorant how to plant and cultivate any good thing, but even if it finds
a store of them it mars and stunts and blights them; and some of them it
even uproots, and introduces their opposites, unmeasured licentiousness,
unseasonable wrath, unrighteous anger, pride, arrogance, foolishness. But
let me not speak of these; for they who have been seized by this malady
will not endure to hear about virtue and vice, being entirely abandoned to
pleasure and therefore enslaved to it. Come then let us forego for the time
being the consideration of these points, and let us bring forward the others
which remain, and see whether wealth has any pleasure, or any honor: for
in my eyes the case is quite the reverse. And first of all, if you please, let
us investigate the meals of rich and poor, and ask the guests which they
are who enjoy the purest and most genuine pleasure; is it they who recline
for a full day on couches, and join breakfast and dinner together, and
distend their stomach, and blunt their senses, and sink the vessel by an
overladen cargo of food, and waterlog the ship, and drench it as in some
shipwreck of the body, and devise fetters, and manacles, and gags, and
bind their whole body with the band of drunkenness and surfeit more
grievous than an iron chain, and enjoy no sound pure sleep undisturbed by

frightful dreams, and are more miserable than madmen and introduce a kind
of self-imposed demon into the soul and display themselves as a laughing
stock to the gaze of their servants, or rather to the kinder sort amongst
them as a tragical spectacle eliciting tears, and cannot recognize any of
those who are present, and are incapable of speaking or hearing but have to
be carried away from their couches to their bed; - or is it they who are
sober and vigilant, and limit their eating by their need, and sail with a
favorable breeze, and find hunger and thirst the best relish in their food and
drink? For nothing is so conducive to enjoyment and health as to be
hungry and thirsty when one attacks the viands, and to identify satiety
with the simple necessity of food, never overstepping the limits of this,
nor imposing a load upon the body too great for its strength.

8. But if you disbelieve my statement study the physical condition, and
the soul of each class. Are not the bodies vigorous of those who live thus
moderately (for do not tell me of that which rarely happens, although
some may be weak from some other circumstance, but form your judgment
from those instances which are of constant occurrence), I say are they not
vigorous, and their senses clear, fulfilling their proper function with much
ease? whereas the bodies of the others are flaccid and softer than wax, and
beset with a crowd of maladies? For gout soon fastens upon them, and
untimely palsy, and premature old age, and headache, and flatulence, and
feebleness of digestion, and loss of appetite, and they require constant
attendance of physicians, and perpetual dosing, and daily care. Are these
things pleasurable? tell me. Who of those that know what pleasure really
is would say so? For pleasure is produced when desire leads the way, and
fruition follows: now if there is fruition, but desire is nowhere to be found,
the conditions of pleasure fail and vanish. On this account also invalids,
although the most charming food is set before them, partake of it with a
feeling of disgust and sense of oppression: because there is no desire which
gives a keen relish to the enjoyment of it. For it is not the nature of the
food, or of the drink, but the appetite of the eaters which is wont to
produce the desire, and is capable of causing pleasure. Therefore also a
certain wise man who had an accurate knowledge of all that concerned
pleasure, and understood how to moralize about these things said "the fall
soul mocketh at honeycombs:" showing that the conditions of pleasure
consist not in the nature of the meal, but in the disposition of the eaters.

Therefore also the prophet recounting the wonders in Egypt and in the
desert mentioned this in connection with the others "He satisfied them
with honey out of the rock." And yet nowhere does it appear that honey
actually sprang forth for them out of the rock: what then is the meaning of
the expression? Because the people being exhausted by much toil and long
traveling, and distressed by great thirst rushed to the cool spring, their
craving for drink serving as a relish, the writer wishing to describe the
pleasures which they received from those fountains called the water
honey, not meaning that the element was converted into honey, but that
the pleasure received from the water rivaled the sweetness of honey,
inasmuch as those who partook of it rushed to it in their eagerness to
drink.

Since then these things are so and no one can deny it, however stupid he
may be: is it not perfectly plain that pure, undiluted, and lively pleasure is
to be found at the tables of the poor? whereas at the tables of the rich
there is discomfort, and disgust and defilement? as that wise man has said
"even sweet things seem to be a vexation."

9. But riches some one will say procure honor for those who possess
them, and enable them to take vengeance on their enemies with ease. And
is this a reason, pray, why riches seem to you desirable and worth
contending for; - that they nourish the most dangerous passion in our
nature, leading on anger into action, swelling the empty bubbles of
ambition, and stimulating and urging men to arrogance? Why these are just
the very reasons why we ought resolutely to turn our backs upon riches,
because they introduce certain fierce and dangerous wild beasts into our
heart depriving us of the real honor which we might receive from all, and
introducing to deluded men another which is the opposite of this, only
painted over with its colors, and persuading them to fancy that it is the
same, when by nature it is not so, but only seems to be so to the eye. For
as the beauty of courtesans, made up as it is of dyes and pigments, is
destitute of real beauty, yet makes a foul and ugly face appear fair and
beautiful to those who are deluded by it when it is not so in reality: even
so also riches force flattery to look like honor. For I beg you not to
consider the praises which are openly bestowed through fear and fawning:
for these are only tints and pigments; but unfold the conscience of each of
those who flatter you in this fashion, and inside it you will see countless

accusers declaring against you, and loathing and detesting you more than
your bitterest adversaries and foes. And if ever a change of circumstances
should occur which would remove and expose this mask which fear has
manufactured, just as the sun when it emits a hotter ray than usual
discloses the real countenances of those women whom I mentioned, then
you will see clearly that all through the former time you were held in the
greatest contempt by those who paid court to you, and you fancied you
were enjoying honor from those who thoroughly hated you, and in their
heart poured infinite abuse upon you, and longed to see you involved in
extreme calamities. For there is nothing like virtue to produce honor, -
honor neither forced nor feigned, nor hidden under a mask of deceit, but
real and genuine, and able to stand the test of hard times.

10. But do you wish to take vengeance on those who have annoyed you?
This, as I was saying just now, is the very reason why wealth ought
specially to be avoided. For it prepares thee to thrust the sword against
thy. self, and renders thee liable to a heavier account in the future day of
reckoning, and makes thy punishment intolerable. For revenge is so great
an evil that it actually revokes the mercy of God, and cancels the
forgiveness of countless sins which has been already bestowed. For he
who received remission of the debt of ten thousand talents, and after
having obtained so great a boon by merely asking for it then made a
demand of one hundred pence from his fellow servant, a demand, that is,
for satisfaction for his transgression against himself, in his severity
towards his fellow servant recorded his own condemnation; and for this
reason and no other he was delivered to the tormentors, and racked, and
required to pay back the ten thousand talents; and he was not allowed the
benefit of any excuse or defense, but suffered the most extreme penalty,
having been commanded to deposit the whole debt which the
lovingkindness of God had formerly remitted. Is this then the reason,
pray, why wealth is so earnestly pursued by thee, because it so easily
conducts thee into sin of this kind? Nay verily, this is why you ought to
abhor it as a foe and an adversary teeming with countless murders. But
poverty, some one will say, disposes men to be discontented and often
also to utter profane words, and condescend to mean actions. It is not
poverty which does this, but littleness of soul: for Lazarus also was poor,
aye! very poor: and besides poverty he suffered from infirmity, a bitterer

trial than any form of poverty, and one which makes poverty more
severely felt; and in addition to infirmity there was a total absence of
protectors, and difficulty in finding any to supply his wants, which
increased the bitterness of poverty and infirmity. For each of these things
is painful in itself, but when there are none to minister to the sufferer's
wants, the suffering becomes greater, the flame more painful, the distress
more bitter, the tempest fiercer, the billows stronger, the furnace hotter.
And if one examines the case thoroughly there was yet a fourth trial
besides these - the unconcern and luxury of the rich man who dwelt hard
by. And if you would find a fifth thing, serving as fuel to the flame, you
will see quite clearly that he was beset by it. For not only was that rich
man living luxuriously, but twice, and thrice, or rather indeed several times
in the day he saw the poor man: for he had been laid at his gate, being a
grievous spectacle of pitiable distress, and the bare sight of him was
sufficient to soften even a heart of stone: and yet even this did not induce
that unmerciful man to assist this case of poverty: but he had his luxurious
table spread, and goblets wreathed with flowers, and pure wine plentifully
poured forth, and grand armies of cooks, and parasites, and flatterers from
early dawn, and troops of singers, cupbearers, and jesters; and he spent all
his time in devising every species of dissipation, and drunkenness, and
surfeiting, and in reveling in dress and feasting and many other things. But
although he saw that poor man every day distressed by grievous hunger
and the bitterest infirmity, and the oppression of his many sores, and by
destitution, and the ills which result from these things, he never even gave
him a thought: yet the parasites and the flatterers were pampered even
beyond their need; but the poor man, and he so very poor, and
encompassed with so many miseries, was not even vouchsafed the crumbs
which fell from that table, although he greatly desired them: and yet none
of these things injured him, he did not give vent to a bitter word, he did not
utter a profane speech; but like a piece of gold which shines all the more
brilliantly when it is purified by excessive heat, even so he, although
oppressed by these sufferings, was superior to all of them, and to the
agitation which in many cases is produced by them. For if generally
speaking poor men, when they see rich men, are consumed with envy and
racked by malicious ill-will, and deem life not worth living, and this even
when they are well supplied with necessary food, and have persons to
minister to their wants; what would the condition of this poor man have

been had he not been very wise and noble hearted, seeing that he was poor
beyond all other poor men, and not only poor. but also infirm, and
without any one to protect or cheer him, and lay in the midst of the city as
if in a remote desert, and wasted away with bitter hunger, and saw all good
things being poured upon the rich man as out of a fountain, and had not
the benefit of any human consolation, but lay exposed as a perpetual meal
for the tongues of the dogs, for he was so enfeebled and broken down in
body that he could not scare them away? Dost thou perceive that he who
does not injure himself suffers no evil? for I will again take up the same
argument.

11. For what harm was done to this hero by his bodily infirmity? or by
the absence of protectors? or by the coming of the dogs? or the evil
proximity of the rich man? or by the great luxury, haughtiness and
arrogance of the latter? Did it enervate him for the contest on behalf of
virtue? Did it ruin his fortitude? Nowhere was he harmed at all, but that
multitude of sufferings, and the cruelty of the rich man, rather increased
his strength, and became the pledge for him of infinite crowns of victory, a
means of adding to his rewards, an augmentation of his recompense, and a
promise of an increased requital. For he was crowned not merely on
account of his poverty, or of his hunger or of his sores, or of the dogs
licking them: but because, having such a neighbor as the rich man, and
being seen by him every day, and perpetually overlooked he endured this
trial bravely and with much fortitude, a trial which added no small flame
but in fact a very strong one to the fire of poverty, and infirmity and
loneliness.

And, tell me, what was the case of the blessed Paul? for there is nothing to
prevent my making mention of him again. Did he not experience
innumerable storms of trial? And in what respect was he injured by them?
Was he not crowned with victory all the more in consequence, - because
he suffered hunger, because he was consumed with cold and nakedness,
because he was often tortured with the scourge, because he was stoned,
because he was cast into the sea? But then some one says he was Paul, and
called by Christ. Yet Judas also was one of the twelve, and he too was
called of Christ; but neither his being of the twelve nor his call profited
him, because he had not a mind disposed to virtue. But Paul although
struggling with hunger, and at a loss to procure necessary food, and daily

undergoing such great sufferings, pursued with great zeal the road which
leads to heaven: whereas Judas although he had been called before him, and
enjoyed the same advantages as he did, and was initiated in the highest
form of Christian life, and partook of the holy table and that most awful of
sacred feasts, and received such grace as to be able to raise the dead, and
cleanse the lepers, and cast out devils, and often heard discourses
concerning poverty, and spent so long a time in the company of Christ
Himself, and was entrusted with the money of the poor, so that his
passion might be soothed thereby (for he was a thief) even then did not
become any better, although he had been favored with such great
condescension. For since Christ knew that he was covetous, and destined
to perish on account of his love of money he not only did not demand
punishment of him for this at that time, but with a view to softening down
his passion he was entrusted with the money of the poor, that having
some means of appeasing his greed he might be saved from falling into that
appalling gulf of sin, checking the greater evil beforehand by a lesser one.

12. Thus in no case will any one be able to injure a man who does not
choose to injure himself: but if a man is not willing to be temperate, and to
aid himself from his own resources no one will ever be able to profit him.
Therefore also that wonderful history of the Holy Scriptures, as in some
lofty, large, and broad picture, has portrayed the lives of the men of old
time, extending the narrative from Adam to the coming of Christ: and it
exhibits to you both those who are upset, and those who are crowned with
victory in the contest, in order that it may instruct you by means of all
examples that no one will be able to injure one who is not injured by
himself, even if all the world were to kindle a fierce war against him. For it
is not stress of circumstances, nor variation of seasons, nor insults of men
in power, nor intrigues besetting thee like snow storms, nor a crowd of
calamities, nor a promiscuous collection of all the ills to which mankind is
subject, which can disturb even slightly the man who is brave, and
temperate, and watchful; just as on the contrary the indolent and supine
man who is his own betrayer cannot be made better, even with the aid of
innumerable ministrations. This at least was made manifest to us by the
parable of the two men, of whom the one built his house upon the rock,
the other upon the sand: not that we are to think of sand and rock, or of a
building of stone, and a roof, or of rivers, and rain, and wild winds, beating

against the buildings, but we are to extract virtue and vice as the meaning
of these things, and to perceive from them that no one injures a man who
does not injure himself. Therefore neither the rain although driven
furiously along, nor the streams dashing against it with much vehemence,
nor the wild winds beating against it with a mighty rush, shook the one
house in any degree: but it remained undisturbed, unmoved: that thou
mightest understand that no trial can agitate the man who does not betray
himself. But the house of the other man was easily swept away, not on
account of the force of the trials (for in that case the other would have
experienced the same fate), but on account of his own folly; for it did not
fall because the wind blew upon it, but because it was built upon the sand,
that is to say upon indolence and iniquity. For before that tempest beat
upon it, it was weak and ready to fall. For buildings of that kind, even if
no one puts any pressure on them, fall to pieces of themselves, the
foundation sinking and giving way in every direction. And just as cobwebs
part asunder, although no strain is put upon them, but adamant remains
unshaken even when it is struck: even so also they who do not injure
themselves become stronger, even if they receive innumerable blows; but
they who betray themselves, even if there is no one to harass them, fall of
themselves, and collapse and perish. For even thus did Judas perish, not
only having been unassailed by any trial of this kind, but having actually
enjoyed the benefit of much assistance.

13. Would you like me to illustrate this argument in the case of whole
nations? What great forethought was bestowed upon the Jewish nation!
was not the whole visible creation arranged with a view to their service?
was not a new and strange method of life introduced amongst them? For
they had not to send down to a market, and so they had the benefit of
things which are sold for money without paying any price for them:
neither did they cleave furrows nor drag a plough, nor harrow the ground,
nor east in seed, nor had they need of rain and wind, and annual seasons,
nor sunshine, nor phases of the moon, nor climate, nor anything of that
kind; they prepared no threshing floor, they threshed no grain, they used
no winnowing fan for separating the grain from the chaff, they turned no
mill-stone, they built no oven, they brought neither wood nor fire into the
house, they needed no baker's art, they handled no spade, they sharpened
no sickle, they required no other art, I mean of weaving or building or

supplying shoes: but the word of God was everything to them. And they
had a table prepared off hand, free of all toil and labor. For such was the
nature of the manna; it was new and fresh, nowhere costing them any
trouble, nor straining them by labor. And their clothes, and shoes, and
even their physical frame forgot their natural infirmity: for the former did
not wear out in the course of so long a time nor did their feet swell
although they made such long marches. of physicians, and medicine, and
all other concern about that kind of art, there was no mention at all
amongst them; so completely banished was infirmity of every kind: for it
is said "He brought them out with silver and gold; and there was not one
feeble person among their tribes." But like men who had quitted this
world, and were transplanted to another and a better one, even so did they
eat and drink, neither did the sun's ray when it waxed hot smite their
heads; for the cloud parted them from the fiery beam, hovering all round
them, and serving like a portable shelter for the whole body of the people.
Neither at night did they need a torch to disperse the darkness, but they
had the pillar of fire, a source of unspeakable light, supplying two wants,
one by its shining. the other by directing the course of their journey; for it
was not only luminous, but also conducted that countless host along the
wilderness with more certainty than any human guide. And they
journeyed not only upon land but also upon sea as if it had been dry land;
and they made an audacious experiment upon the laws of nature by
treading upon that angry sea, marching through it as if it had been the hard
and resisting surface of a rock; and indeed when they placed their feet
upon it the element became like solid earth, and gently sloping plains and
fields; but when it received their enemies it wrought after the nature of sea;
and to the Israelites indeed it served as a chariot, but to their enemies it
became a grave; conveying the former across with ease, but drowning the
latter with great violence. And the disorderly flood of water displayed the
good order and subordination which marks reasonable and highly
intelligent men, fulfilling the part at one time of a guardian, at another of an
executioner, and exhibiting these opposites together on one day. What
shall one say of the rocks which gave forth streams of water? what of the
clouds of birds which covered the whole face of the earth by the number of
their carcasses? what of the wonders in Egypt? what of the marvels in the
wilderness? what of the triumphs and bloodless victories? for they
subdued those who opposed them like men keeping holiday rather than

making war. And they vanquished their own masters without the use of
arms; and overcame those who fought with them after they left Egypt by
means of singing and music; and what they did was a festival rather than a
campaign, a religious ceremony rather than a battle. For all these wonders
took place not merely for the purpose of supplying their need, but also
that the people might preserve more accurately the doctrine which Moses
inculcated of the knowledge of God; and voices proclaiming the presence
of their Master were uttered on all sides of them. For the sea loudly
declared this, by becoming a road for them to march upon, and then
turning into sea again: and the waters of the Nile uttered this voice when
they were converted into the nature of blood; and the frogs, and the great
army of locusts, and the caterpillar and blight declared the same thing to all
the people; and the wonders in the desert, the manna, the pillar of fire, the
cloud, the quails, and all the other incidents served them as a book, and
writing which could never be effaced, echoing daily in their memory and
resounding in their mind. Nevertheless after such great and remarkable
providence, after all those unspeakable benefits, after such mighty
miracles, after care indescribable, after continual teaching, after instruction
by means of speech, and admonition by means of deeds, after glorious
victories, after extraordinary triumphs, after abundant supply of food,
after the plentiful production of water, after the ineffable glory with which
they were invested in the eyes of the human race, being ungrateful and
senseless they worshipped a calf, and paid reverence to the head of a bull,
even when the memorials of God's benefits in Egypt were fresh in their
minds, and they were still in actual enjoyment of many more.

14. But the Ninevites, although a barbarous and foreign people who had
never participated in any of these benefits, small or great, neither words,
nor wonders, nor works when they saw a man who had been saved from
shipwreck, who had never associated with them before, but appeared then
for the first time, enter their city and say "yet three days and Nineveh
shall be overthrown," were so converted and reformed by the mere sound
of these words, and putting away their former wickedness, advanced in the
direction of virtue by the path of repentance, that they caused the
sentence of God to be revoked, and arrested the threatened disturbance of
their city, and averted the heaven-sent wrath, and were delivered from
every kind of evil. "For," we read, "God saw that every man turned from

his evil way, and was converted to the Lord." How turned? I ask.
Although their wickedness was great, their iniquity unspeakable, their
moral sores difficult to heal, which was plainly shown by the prophet
when he said "their wickedness ascended even unto the heaven:" indicating
by the distance of the place the magnitude of their wickedness;
nevertheless such great iniquity which was piled up to such a height as to
reach even to the heaven, all this in the course of three days in a brief
moment of time through the effect of a few words which they heard from
the mouth of one man and he an unknown shipwrecked stranger they so
thoroughly abolished, removed out of sight, and put away, as to have the
happiness of hearing the declaration "God saw that every one turned from
his evil way, and He repented of the evil which God said He would do
them." Seest thou that he who is temperate and watchful not only suffers
no injury at the hands of man, but even turns back Heaven-sent wrath?
whereas he who betrays himself and harms himself by his own doing, even
if he receives countess benefits, reaps no great advantage. So, at least, the
Jews were not profited by those great miracles, nor on the other hand were
the Ninevites harmed by having no share in them; but inasmuch as they
were inwardly well-disposed, having laid hold of a slight opportunity they
became better, barbarians and foreigners though they were, ignorant of all
divine revelation, and dwelling at a distance from Palestine.

15. Again, I ask, was the virtue of the "three children" corrupted by the
troubles which beset them? Whilst they were still young, mere youths, of
immature age, did they not undergo that grievous affliction of captivity?
had they not to make a long journey from home, and when they had
arrived in the foreign country were they not cut off from fatherland and
home and temple, and altar and sacrifices, and offerings, and drink
offerings, and even the singing of psalms? For not only were they debarred
from their home, but as a consequence from many forms of worship also.
Were they not given up into the hands of barbarians, wolves rather than
men? and, most painful calamity of all, when they had been banished into
so distant and barbarous a country, and were suffering such a grievous
captivity were they not without teacher, without prophets, without ruler?
"for," it is written, "there is no ruler, nor prophet, nor governor, nor place
for offering before Thee and finding mercy." Yea moreover they were cast
into the royal palace, as upon some cliff and crag, and a sea full of rocks

and reefs, being compelled to sail over that angry sea without a pilot or
signal man, or crew, or sails; and they were cooped up in the royal court as
in a prison. For inasmuch as they knew spiritual wisdom, and were
superior to worldly things, and despised all human pride and made the
wings of their soul soar upwards, they counted their sojourn there as an
aggravation of their trouble. For had they been outside the court, and
dwelling in a private house they would have enjoyed more independence:
but having been cast into that prison (for they deemed the splendor of the
palace no better than a prison, no safer than a place of rocks and crags)
they were straightway subjected to cruel embarrassment. For the king
commanded them to be partakers of his own table, a luxurious, unclean and
profane table, a thing which was forbidden them, and seemed more terrible
than death; and they were lonely men hemmed in like lambs amongst so
many wolves. And they were constrained to choose between being
consumed by famine or rather led off to execution, and tasting of forbidden
meats. What then did these youths do, forlorn as they were, captives,
strangers, slaves of those who commanded these things. They did not
consider that this strait or the absolute power of him who possessed the
state sufficed to justify their compliance; but they employed every device
and expedient to enable them to avoid the sin, although they were
abandoned on every side. For they could not influence men by money:
how should they, being captives? nor by friendship and social intercourse?
how should they being strangers? nor could they get the better of them by
any exertion of power: how was it possible being slaves? nor matter them
by force of numbers: how could they being only three? Therefore they
approached the eunuch who possessed the necessary authority, and
persuaded him by their arguments. For when they saw him fearful and
trembling, and in an agony of alarm concerning his own safety, and the
dread of death which agitated his soul was intolerable: "for I fear" said he
"my Lord the king, lest he should see your countenances sadder than the
children which are of your sort and so shall ye endanger my head to the
king," having released him from this fear they persuaded him to grant them
the favor. And inasmuch as they brought to the work all the strength
which they had, God also henceforth contributed his strength to it. For it
was not God's doing only that they achieved those things for the sake of
which they were to receive a reward, but the beginning and starting point
was from their own purpose, and having manifested that to be noble and

brave, they won for themselves the help of God, and so accomplished
their aim.

16. Dost thou then perceive that if a man does not injure himself, no one
else will be able to harm him? Behold at least youthfulness, and captivity
and destitution, and removal into a foreign land, and loneliness, and dearth
of protectors, and a stern command, and great fear of death assailing the
mind of the eunuch, and poverty, and feebleness of numbers, and dwelling
in the midst of barbarians, and having enemies for masters, and surrender
into the hands of the king himself, and separation from all their kindred,
and removal from priests and prophets, and from all others who cared for
them, and the cessation of drink offerings and sacrifices, and loss of the
temple and psalmody, and yet none of these things harmed them; but they
had more renown then than when they enjoyed these things in their native
land. And after they had accomplished this task first and had wreathed
their brows with the glorious garland of victory, and had kept the law even
in a foreign land, and trampled under foot the tyrant's command, and
overcome fear of the avenger, and yet received no harm from any quarter,
as if they had been quietly living at home and enjoying the benefit of all
those things which I mentioned, after they had thus fearlessly
accomplished their work they were again summoned to other contests.
And again they were the same men; and they were subjected to a more
severe trial than the former one, and a furnace was kindled, and they were
confronted by the barbarian army in company with the king: and the
whole Persian force was set in motion and everything was devised which
tended to put deceit or confront upon them: divers kinds of music, and
various forms of punishment, and threats, and what they saw on every
side of them was alarming, and the words which they heard were more
alarming than what they saw; nevertheless inasmuch as they did not
betray themselves, but made the most of their own strength, they never
sustained any kind of damage: but even won for themselves more glorious
crowns of victory than before. For Nabuchadonosor bound them and cast
them into the furnace, yet he burnt them not. but rather benefited them,
and rendered them more illustrious. And although they were deprived of
temple (for I will repeat my former remarks) and altar, and fatherland, and
priests and prophets, although they were in a foreign and barbarous
county, in the very midst of the furnace, surrounded by all that mighty

host, the king himself who wrought this looking on, they set up a glorious
trophy, and won a notable victory, having sung that admirable and
extraordinary hymn which from that day to this has been sung throughout
the world and will continue to be sung to future generations.

Thus then when a man does not injure himself, he cannot possibly be hurt
by another: for I will not cease harping constantly upon this saying. For if
captivity, and bondage, and loneliness and loss of country and all kindred
and death, and burning, and a great army and a savage tyrant could not do
any damage to the innate virtue of the three children captives, bondsmen,
strangers though they were in a foreign land, but the enemy's assault
became to them rather the occasion of greater confidence: what shall be
able to harm the temperate man? There is nothing, even should he have the
whole world in arms against him. But, some one may say, in their case
God stood beside them, and plucked them out of the flame. Certainly He
did; and if thou wilt play thy part to the best of thy power, the help
which God supplies will assuredly follow.

17. Nevertheless the reason why I admire those youths, and pronounce
them blessed, and enviable, is not because they tramped on the flame, and
vanquished the force of the fire: but because they were bound, and cast
into the furnace, and delivered to the fire for the sake of true doctrine. For
this it was which constituted the completeness of their triumph, and the
wreath of victory was placed on their brows as soon as they were cast
into the furnace and before the issue of events it began to be weaved for
them from the moment that they uttered those words which they spoke
with much boldness and freedom of speech to the king when they were
brought into his presence. "We have no need to answer thee concerning
this thing: for our God in Heaven whom we serve is able to rescue us out
of the burning fiery furnace: and He will deliver us out of thy hands, O
King. But if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not serve thy
Gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up." After the
utterance of these words I proclaimed them conquerors; after these words
having grasped the prize of victory, they hastened on to the glorious
crown of martyrdom, following up the confession which they made
through their words with the confession made through their deeds. But if
when they had been cast into it, the fire had respect for their bodies, and
undid their bonds, and suffered them to go down into it without fear, and

forgot its natural force, so that the furnace of fire became as a fountain of
cool water, this marvel was the effect of God's grace and of the divine
wonder-working power. Yet the heroes themselves even before these
things took place, as soon as they set foot in the flames had erected their
trophy, and won their victory, and put on their crown, and had been
proclaimed conquerors both in Heaven and on earth, and so far as they
were concerned nothing was wanting for their renown. What then wouldst
thou have to say to these things? Hast thou been driven into exile, and
expelled from thy county? Behold so also were they. Hast thou suffered
captivity, and become the servant of barbarian makers. Well! this also thou
wilt find befell these men. But thou hast no one present there to regulate
thy state nor to advise or instruct thee? Well! of attention of this kind
these men were destitute. Or thou hast been bound, burned, put to death?
for thou canst not tell me of anything more painful than these things. Yet
lo! these men having gone through them all, were made more glorious by
each one of them, yea more exceedingly illustrious, and increased the store
of their treasures in Heaven. And the Jews indeed who had both temple,
and altar, and ark and cherubim, and mercy-seat, and veil, and an infinite
multitude of priests, and daily services, and morning and evening
sacrifices, and continually heard the voices of the prophets, both living and
de-pared, sounding in their ears, and carried about with them the
recollection of the wonders which were done in Egypt, and in the
wilderness, and all the rest, and turned the story of these things over in
their hands, and had them inscribed upon their door posts and enjoyed the
benefit at that time of much supernatural power and every other kind of
help were yet no wise profited, but rather damaged, having set up idols in
the temple itself, and having sacrificed their sons and daughters under
trees, and in almost every part of the country in Palestine having offered
those unlawful and accursed sacrifices, and perpetrated countless other
deeds yet more monstrous. But these men although in the midst of a
barbarous and hostile land, having their occupation in a tyrant's house,
deprived of all that care of which I have been speaking, led away to
execution, and subjected to burning, not only suffered no harm there from
small or great, but became the more illustrious. Knowing then these things,
and collecting instances of the like kind from the inspired divine Scriptures
(for it is possible to find many such examples in the case of various other
persons) we deem that neither a difficulty arising from seasons or events,

nor compulsion and force, nor the arbitrary authority of potentates furnish
a sufficient excuse for us when we transgress. I will now conclude my
discourse by repeating what I said at the beginning, that if any one be
harmed and injured he certainly suffers this at his own hands, not at the
hands of others even if there be countless multitudes injuring and insulting
him: so that if he does not suffer this at his own hands, not all the
creatures who inhabit the whole earth and sea if they combined to attack
him would be able to hurt one who is vigilant and sober in the Lord. Let us
then, I beseech you, be sober and vigilant at all times, and let us endure all
painful things bravely that we may obtain those everlasting and pure
blessings in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and power, now and
ever throughout all ages. Amen.

LETTERS OF ST. CHRYSOTOM

TO OLYMPIAS

TRANSLATED BY

REV. W. R. STEPHENS, M.A.,

PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL, AND RECTOR
OF WOOLBEDING, SUSSEX.

INTRODUCTION TO THE LETTERS TO OLYMPIAS

THE deaconess Olympia to whom seventeen of Chrysostom's extant
letters are addressed was the most eminent of his female friends. She
belonged to a Pagan family of high rank, and was born about 368. Her
father Seleucus who was a count of the Empire died when she was a young
girl, and she was brought up under the guardianship of an uncle Procopius,
who was a devout Christian and a friend of Gregory of Nazianzus.
Gregory took great interest in her, speaking of her in his letters as "his
own Olympias" and delighting to be addressed by her as "father." Her
governess Theodosia, sister of St. Amphilochius of Iconium, was a woman
whom Gregory exhorted her to imitate as the very pattern of Christian
goodness. The orphan girl had great personal beauty, and was the heiress
of a large fortune. Naturally therefore she had many suitors, and in 384 at
the age of sixteen she was wedded to Nebridius, a young man of high rank
and irreproachable character. The marriage however does not seem to have
been a happy one, and perhaps in this fact as well as in the death of her
husband about two years after their union, Olympias saw a divine
intimation that she should not entangle herself again in the worldly cares
and anxieties incident to married life. The Emperor Theodosius wished to
unite her to a young Spaniard, Elpidius, a kinsman of his own, and irritated
by her refusal, ordered her property to be confiscated until she should
have attained her thirtieth year, unless she consented to the proposed
union. Olympias however remained inflexible and in a letter of dignified
sarcasm thanked the Emperor for relieving her from a heavy burden. "He
could not have conferred a greater blessing upon her unless he had ordered
her wealth to be bestowed upon the Churches and the poor." Theodosius
perceiving the uselessness, if not regretting the injustice, of his harsh
degree, canceled it, and left her in the undisturbed enjoyment of her
property. Henceforward her time and wealth were devoted to the service
of religion. She ministered to the necessities of the sick and poor, and
supported the work of the Church in Greece, Asia Minor and Syria with
such lavish donations, not only of her money but of her land, that even
Chrysostom, who might be called the great preacher of almsgiving, warned
her against indiscriminate liberality, reminding her that as her wealth was a
trust committed to her by God she ought to be discreet in the management

of it. This salutary advice gained him the ill-will of many avaricious
bishops and clergy who had profited, or hoped to profit, by her gifts. She
in her turn requited the Archbishop for his spiritual care by many little
feminine attentions to his bodily wants, especially by seeing that he was
supplied with wholesome food, and did not overstrain his feeble
constitution by a too rigid abstinence. She herself however practiced the
most austere asceticism, renouncing the luxury of the bath, wearing none
but old coarse clothing, and subjecting herself to severe restrictions in
respect of food and sleep.

After the expulsion of Chrysostom from Constantinople 404, through the
intrigues of his enemies, Olympias suffered much from the persecution to
which all his followers were subjected. She was accused of having been
concerned in causing the fire which broke out immediately after his
departure, and destroyed the Cathedral Church and the Senate House. Her
intrepid demeanor before the praefect who tried in vain to frighten her into
a confession of guilt, or induce her to acknowledge Arsacius who had been
intruded into the See by an arbitrary exercise of imperial power, excited
general admiration; and the tidings of her fortitude were a great consolation
to the exiled archbishop in the midst of much bodily suffering, and mental
distress. It is not quite certain whether she was driven from
Constantinople or voluntarily retired from it; nor have we any definite
information concerning the remainder of her life.

LETTERS TO OLYMPIAS

TO MY LADY,

THE MOST REVEREND AND DIVINELY FAVORED DEACONESS
OLYMPIAS, I JOHN, BISHOP, SEND GREETING IN THE LORD

1. COME now let me relieve the wound of thy despondency, and disperse
the thoughts which gather this cloud of care around thee. For what is it
which upsets thy mind, and why art thou sorrowful and dejected? Is it
because of the fierce black storm which has overtaken the Church,
enveloping all things in darkness as of a night without a moon, and is
growing to a head every day, travailing to bring forth disastrous
shipwrecks, and increasing the ruin of the world? I know all this as well as
you; none shall gainsay it, and if you like I will form an image of the things
now taking place so as to present the tragedy yet more distinctly to thee.
We behold a sea upheaved from the very lowest depths, some sailors
floating dead upon the waves, others engulfed by them, the planks of the
ships breaking up, the sails torn to tatters, the masts sprung, the oars
dashed out of the sailors' hands, the pilots seated on the deck, clasping
their knees with their hands instead of grasping the rudder, bewailing the
hopelessness of their situation with sharp cries and bitter lamentations,
neither sky nor sea clearly visible, but all one deep and impenetrable
darkness, so that no one can see his neighbor, whilst mighty is the roaring
of the billows, and monsters of the sea attack the crews on every side.

But how much further shall I pursue the unattainable? for whatever image
of our present evils I may seek speech shrinks baffled from the attempt.
Nevertheless even when I look at these calamities I do not abandon the
hope of better things, considering as I do who the pilot is in all this - not
one who gets the better of the storm by his art, but calms the raging waters
by his rod. But if He does not effect this at the outset and speedily, such
is His custom - He does not at the beginning put down these terrible
evils, but when they have increased, and come to extremities, and most
persons are reduced to despair, then He works wondrously, and beyond

all expectation, thus manifesting his own power, and training the patience
of those who undergo these calamities. Do not therefore be cast down. For
there is only one thing, Olympias, which is really terrible, only one real
trial, and that is sin; and I have never ceased continually harping upon this
theme; but as for all other things, plots, enmities, frauds, calumnies,
insults, accusations, confiscation, exile, the keen sword of the enemy, the
peril of the deep, warfare of the whole world, or anything else you like to
name, they are but idle tales. For whatever the nature of these things may
be they are transitory and perishable, and operate in a mortal body
without doing any injury to the vigilant soul. Therefore the blessed Paul,
desiring to prove the insignificance both of the pleasures and sorrows
relating to this life, declared the whole truth in one sentence when he said
- "For the things which are seen are temporal." Why then dost thou fear
temporal things which pass away like the stream of a river. For such is the
nature of present things whether they be pleasant or painful. And another
prophet compared all human prosperity not to grass, but to another
material even more flimsy, describing the whole of it "as the flower of
grass." For he did not single out any one part of it, as wealth alone, or
luxury alone, or power, or honor; but having comprised all the things
which are esteemed splendid amongst men under the one designation of
glory he said "all the glory of man is as the flower of grass."

2. Nevertheless, you will say, adversity is a terrible thing and grievous to
be born. Yet look at it again compared with another image and then also
learn to despise it. For the railings, and insults, and reproaches, and gibes
inflicted by enemies, and their plots are compared to a worn-out garment,
and moth-eaten wool when God says "Fear ye not the reproach of men,
neither be ye afraid of their revilings, for they shall wax old as doth a
garment, and like moth-eaten wool so shall they be consumed." Therefore
let none of these things which are happening trouble thee, but ceasing to
invoke the aid of this or that person, and to run after shadows (for such
are human alliances), do thou persistently call upon Jesus, whom thou
servest, merely to bow his head; and in a moment of time all these evils
will be dissolved. But if thou hast already called upon Him, and yet they
have not been dissolved, such is the manner of God's dealing (for I will
resume my former argument); He does not put down evils at the outset,
but when they have grown to a head, when scarcely any form of the

enemy's malice remains ungratified, then He suddenly converts all things
to a state of tranquillity and conducts them to an unexpected settlement.
For He is not only able to turn as many things as we expect and hope, to
good, but many more, yea infinitely more. Wherefore also Paul saith "now
to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or
think." Could He not, for example, have prevented the three children at the
outset from falling into trial? But He did not choose to do this, thereby
conferring great pain upon them. Therefore He suffered them to be
delivered into the hands of barbarians, and the furnace to be heated to an
immeasurable height and the wrath of the king to blaze even more fiercely
than the furnace, and hands and feet to be bound with great severity and
they themselves to be cast into the fire; and then, when all they who
beheld despaired of their rescue, suddenly, and beyond all hope, the
wonder-working power of God, the supreme artificer, was displayed, and
shone forth with exceeding splendor. For the fire was bound, and the
bondsmen were released; and the furnace became a temple of prayer, a
place of fountains and dew, of higher dignity than a royal court, and the
very hairs of their head prevailed over that all devouring element which
gets the better even of iron and stone, and masters every kind of
substance. And a solemn song of universal praise was instituted there by
these holy men inviting every kind of created thing to join in the wondrous
melody; and they uttered hymns of thanksgiving to God for that they had
been bound, and also burnt, as far at least as the malice of their enemies
had power; that they had been exiles from their country, captives deprived
of their liberty, wandering outcasts from city and home, sojourners in a
strange and barbarous land; for all this was the outpouring of a grateful
heart. And when the malicious devices of their enemies were perfected (for
what further could they attempt after their death?) and the labors of the
heroes were completed, and the garland of victory was woven, and their
rewards were prepared and nothing more was wanting for their renown;
then at last their calamities were brought to an end, and he who caused the
furnace to be kindled, and delivered them over to that great punishment,
became himself the panegyrist of those holy heroes, and the herald of
God's marvelous deed, and everywhere throughout the world issued
letters full of reverent praise, recording what had taken place, and
becoming the faithful herald of the miracles wrought by the
wonder-working God. For inasmuch as he had been an enemy and

adversary what he wrote was above suspicion even in the opinion of
enemies.

3. Dost thou see the abundance of resource belonging to God? His
wisdom, His extraordinary power, His loving-kindness and care? Be not
therefore dismayed or troubled but continue to give thanks to God for all
things, praising, and invoking Him; beseeching and supplicating; even if
countless tumults and troubles come upon thee, even if tempests are
stirred up before thy eyes let none of these things disturb thee. For our
Master is not baffled by the difficulty, even if all things are reduced to the
extremity of ruin. For it is possible for Him to raise those who have fallen,
to convert those who are in error, to set straight those who have been
ensnared, to release those who have been laden with countless sins, and
make them righteous, to quicken those who are dead, to restore luster to
decayed things and freshness to those which have waxen old. For if He
makes things which are not, come into being, and bestows existence on
things which are nowhere by any means manifest, how much more will He
rectify things which already exist. But you will say there are many who
perish, many who are caught by snares. Many such things have indeed
often taken place, yet afterwards have all received their appropriate
correction, save some few who have remained in an incurable condition,
even after the change in their circumstances. Why are you troubled and
distracted because such a person is cast out and such another is put into
his place? Christ was crucified and the release of Barabbas the robber was
demanded, and the depraved populace clamored for the preservation of the
murderer rather than of the Savior and benefactor. How many think you
then stumbled at these things? how many were destroyed? But I must
carry my argument yet further back. Did not He who was crucified
become immediately after his birth a wanderer and a fugitive? was He not
from the very cradle removed with the whole household into a strange
land, taking that long journey into a barbarous region? And this removal
gave occasion to torrents of blood, and cruel murder and slaughter, and all
the children of tender age were cut to pieces just as if they had been
soldiers arrayed in battle, and infants torn from the breast were handed
over to death, and even when the milk was in their throats, the sword was
driven through their necks. What could be more distressing than this
tragedy? And these things were done by him who sought to destroy Jesus,

yet the long-suffering God endured this tragical cruelty, which caused so
much bloodshed, and forbore to prevent it although He had the power,
displaying his long-suffering for some inscrutably wise purpose. And
when Jesus had returned from the foreign land and was grown up, war was
rekindled against him on every side. First of all the disciples of John were
envious of Him and tried to slander Him, although John himself behaved
reverently to Him, and they said "He who was with thee beyond Jordan,
behold the same baptizeth and all men come to Him." For these were the
words of men who were already irritated, and agitated by ill-will, and
consumed by that passion. For the same reason also one of the disciples
who said these things disputed with a certain Jew and raised a contentious
argument about purifying, comparing one kind of baptism with another,
the baptism of John with that of the disciples of Christ. "For there arose"
it is said, "a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a certain Jew
about purifying." And when He began to work miracles how many
calumniators He had! Some called Him a Samaritan and demoniac saying
"Thou art a Samaritan and hast a Devil" others "a deceiver," saying "This
man is not of God but deceiveth the multitude" others "a sorcerer" saying
"He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the prince of the Devils" and
they continually said these things against Him and called Him an adversary
of God, and a gluttonous, and greedy man, and a drunkard, and a friend of
the wicked and depraved. "For" He said, "the Son of man came eating and
drinking and they say behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend
of publicans and sinners." And when he was conversing with the harlot
they called Him a false prophet; "For had He been a prophet," one said,
"He would have known who this woman is which speaketh unto Him;" in
fact every day they sharpened their teeth against Him. And not only did
the Jews thus oppose Him, but even those who were reputed to be his
brethren were not sincerely attached to Him, but even out of his own
family opposition was kindled against Him. See at least how they also
themselves were perverted, from the evangelist adding the remark "for
neither did His brethren believe on Him."

4. But since you call to mind many who were offended and went astray,
how many of the disciples do you suppose were offended at the time of
the crucifixion? One betrayed Him, the others took to flight, one denied
Him, and when all had abandoned Him He was led away bound without

companions. How many then think you who had lately seen Him working
His miracles, raising the dead, cleansing lepers, casting out devils,
multiplying loaves, and doing all other kinds of wonderful deeds, were
offended at that season, when they beheld Him led away and bound,
surrounded by common soldiers, and followed by Jewish priests making a
tumult and uproar; alone in the midst hemmed in by all his enemies, and
the traitor standing by and exulting in his deed? And what was the effect
think you when He was being scourged? and probably a vast multitude
was present. For it was an illustrious festival which brought all together,
and this drama of iniquity was enacted in the capital city, and in the very
middle of the day. How many think you who were present then were
offended when they saw Him bound, scourged, streaming with blood,
examined before the governor's tribunal, and not one of His disciples
standing by? What was the effect again when He was subjected to those
manifold kinds of mockery, successively repeated, when they crowned
Him with thorns, then arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, then put a reed in
His hand, then fell down and worshipped Him, setting in motion every
species of ribaldry and derision? How many think you were offended,
how many bewildered, how many perplexed when they smote Him on the
cheek and said "prophesy unto us thou Christ who is He that smote
thee?" and when they led Him hither and thither, and spent the whole day
in scoffs and abuse, and ribaldry and derision in the midst of the Jewish
assembly? and when the servant of the High-Priest dealt Him a blow; and
when the soldiers parted His garments amongst them and when He was led
up to the cross, having the marks of the scourge upon His back, and was
fastened to the wood, how many think you were offended? For not even
then were those savage beasts softened, but became more furious than
before, and the tragedy became more intense, and the ribaldry increased.
For some said "Ah! thou that destroyest the temple, and in three days
buildest it up;" and some, "He saved others, Himself He cannot save."

And others said "If thou art the Son of God come down from the cross
and we will believe thee."

Again when they insulted Him by offering Him gall and vinegar on the
sponge how many think you were offended? or when the robbers reviled
Him? or when as I have already said, they made that dreadful and
monstrous assertion that the robber and housebreaker, the man laden with

the crime of murder deserved to be released rather than Jesus, and having
received permission from the judge to make their choice preferred
Barabbas, desiring not only to crucify Christ, but also to involve Him in
infamy? For they thought that by these means they should be able to
manufacture the belief that He was worse than the robber, and such a great
transgressor that neither on the plea of mercy, nor of the privilege of the
Festival was it possible to save Him. For they did everything with a view
to slander His fame; which also was the reason why they crucified the two
robbers with Him. Nevertheless the truth was not obscured, but shone
forth all the more clearly. And they accused Him of usurping kingly power
saying "Every one who maketh himself a king is not a friend of Caesar"
bringing this charge of usurpation against one who had not where to lay his
head. Moreover they brought a calumnious accusation of blasphemy
against Him. For the High Priest rent his clothes saying "He hath spoken
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses?" And what was the
nature of his death? was it not a violent one? was it not the death of
capital offenders? of execrable criminals? was it not of the vilest kind? was
it not the death of those who have perpetrated the worst offenses, and are
not worthy to draw even their last breath upon the earth? And then as to
the manner of his burial, was it not accomplished as a matter of favor? For
a certain one came and begged for his body. Thus not even he who buried
Him belonged to his own friends, to those whom He had benefited, to his
disciples, to those who had enjoyed such free and salutary intercourse
with Him, for all had taken to flight, all had hurried away from Him. And
that base Suspicion which his enemies contrived in consequence of the
resurrection when they said "His disciples came and stole Him" how
many think you were offended, how many for a time upset by that? For
the story prevailed at that time, although it was a fabrication, and was
bought for money; nevertheless it held its ground amongst some people,
after the seals (of the sepulcher were broken) after the manifest
appearance of the truth. For the multitude did not know the prediction of
the resurrection (and no wonder), inasmuch as even his disciples did not
understand it; for we read "they did not know that He must rise again
from the dead." How many therefore think you were offended in those
days? And yet the long-suffering God patiently endured, ordering all
things according to His own inscrutable wisdom.

5. Then again after those days the disciples continued to live in hiding and
secrecy, being fugitives full of fear and trembling, continually shifting from
place to place, and even when they began to appear after fifty days, and to
work miracles, they did not enjoy perfect security; but even after those
events there were innumerable stumbling-blocks to offend the weaker
brethren, when they were scourged, when the Church was distressed,
when they themselves were driven away, and their enemies had the upper
hand in many places, and raised tumults. For when they had acquired
much confidence by means of the miracles which they wrought, then the
death of Stephen again caused a severe persecution, and dispersed them all,
and involved the Church in confusion; and the disciples were again
alarmed, fugitive, and distressed. And yet the Church continually grew,
when it flourished by means of the signs which were wrought and became
illustrious from the manner of its introduction. One disciple for example
was let down through a window, and so escaped the hands of the ruler;
others were brought out of prison by an angel and so released from their
fetters; others were received into the houses of common people and
artisans when they were driven out by those in authority; they were
courteously treated in every way, by female sellers of purple, by
tentmakers, and tanners dwelling in the outskirts of the cities, and by the
sea shore. Frequently moreover they did not dare to appear in the middle
of the towns; and if they did venture there themselves their entertainers
did not. And thus amidst alternate trials, and respites from trial, the fabric
of the Church was wrought, and they who once stumbled were afterwards
set upright, and they who wandered away were brought back, and the
ruined places were built up more firmly than before. For this cause when
Paul prayed that the preaching of the word might proceed by a smooth
course only, God rich in wisdom and resource did not yield to His
disciple; nay even when many times invoked he would not consent but
said "my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in
weakness." If then even now you will reckon up the good things with the
painful, you will see that many events have occurred which if not positive
signs and wonders do yet resemble signs, and are unspeakable proofs of
the great providence and succor of God. But that you may not hear
everything from me without any trouble, I leave this as thy task, that you
may reckon up everything accurately and compare them with the
misfortunes, and by occupying yourself with this good employment may

divert your mind from despondency; for you will derive much consolation
from this work.

Pray say many kind words from me to all your blessed household. May
you continue in good health and good spirits, most reverend and divinely
favored lady.

If you wish me to write long letters inform me of this, and pray do not
deceive me by saying that you have thrown off all despondency, and are
enjoying a season of rest. For letters are a remedy of the proper kind to
produce great cheerfulness in thee, and you will continually see letters
from me. And when you write to me again do not say "I have much
comfort from your letters, for this I know of myself, but tell me that you
have as much as I wish you to have, that you are not confounded with
sorrow, that you do not pass your time in weeping, but in serenity and
cheerfulness.

TO OLYMPIAS

Do not be anxious on my behalf, nor rack yourself with solicitude, on
account of the severity of the winter, and the weakness of my digestion,
and the incursions of the Isaurians. For the winter is only what it is wont
to be in Armenia; nothing more need be said about it; and it does not very
seriously injure me. For in anticipation of these things I have devised
many plans for averting the mischief which might arise from them; keeping
up a constant fire, setting screens about the chamber in which I live, using
a large number of rugs, and staying always indoors. This indeed is irksome
to me, if it were not for the benefit to be derived; for as long as I remain
indoors I am not severely distressed by the cold; but if I am compelled to
go out a little, and come in contact with the outer air, I suffer no small
damage. Wherefore I beseech thee dear lady, and entreat thee as a very
great favor to pay great attention to the restoration of thy bodily health.
For dejection causes sickness; and when the body is exhausted and
enfeebled, and remains in a neglected condition, deprived of the assistance
of physicians, and of a wholesome climate, and an abundant supply of the
necessaries of life, consider how great an aggravation of distress is
occasioned thereby. Wherefore I beseech you, dear lady, to employ

various and skilled physicians, and to take medicines which avail to correct
these conditions. For a few days ago when I suffered from a tendency to
vomiting, owing to the state of the atmosphere, I had recourse amongst
other remedies to the drug which was sent me by my most discreet
mistress Syncletion, and I found that no more than three days' application
of it cured my infirmity. I beseech you therefore to make use of this
remedy also yourself and to arrange that some more of it may be sent to
me. For having again felt somewhat upset, I again had recourse to it, and
completely cured my disorder; for it allays the deep internal inflammation,
draws out moisture on the skin, causes a moderate degree of warmth,
infuses no little vigor, and excites an appetite for food; and all these effects
I experienced in the course of a few days. Let then my most honored Lord
the Count Theophilus be exhorted to take means to send some of this to
me again. And do not be distressed at my wintering here, for I am in a
much more comfortable and sounder state of health than I was last year; so
that if you also would take the requisite care of yourself, you would be in
a far more satisfactory condition. Now if you say that your ailments have
been produced by despondency how is it that you again ask for letters
from me, seeing that you have not derived any benefit from them in the
direction of cheerfulness, but have sunk so deeply under the tyranny of
despondency as even to desire to depart out of this world. Are you
ignorant how great a reward even of sickness awaits one who has a
thankful spirit? Have I not often, both in person, and through letters,
discoursed to you concerning this theme? But since the pressure of
business perhaps, or the peculiar nature of your sickness, and the quick
succession of changes in your condition do not permit you to retain what I
have said constantly and dearly in your mind, listen once more whilst I try
to heal the wounds of thy despondency by repeating the same
incantations: "for to write the same things," it is said, "to me indeed is not
grievous, and for you it is safe."

2. What is it then which I say and write? Nothing, Olympias, redounds so
much to the credit of any one as patient endurance in suffering. For this is
indeed the queen of virtues, and the perfection of crowns; and as it excels
all other forms of righteousness, so this particular species of it is more
glorious than the rest. Perhaps what I have said seems obscure; I will
therefore try to make it clearer. What then is it that I affirm? Not the

spoliation of goods, even if one were to be stripped bare of all one's
possessions, not the loss of honors, nor expulsion from one's country, and
transportation to a distant land, nor the strain of labor and toil, nor
imprisonment, and bondage, nor reproaches, and abuse, and scoffings (not
indeed that you are to think the courageous endurance of such things a
slight kind of fortitude, as Jeremiah that great and eminent prophet proves
who was not a little distressed by this kind of trial); yet not even this, nor
the loss of children, even should they be torn from us in one fell swoop,
nor the perpetual assaults of enemies, nor anything else of that nature, no,
nor even the head and crown of things accounted painful, namely death,
terrible and loathsome though it be, is so oppressive as infirmity of body.
And this is proved by the greatest hero of endurance, who, when he was
encompassed by bodily sickness, thought death would be a release from
the calamities which were depressing him; and when he underwent all the
other sufferings, was not sensible of them, although he received blow after
blow, and at last a deadly one. For it was no slight matter, but rather an
evidence of the most malignant cruelty on the part of his enemy in dealing
with one who was no novice in suffering, nor entering the lists for the first
time, but already exhausted with the frequent repetition of assaults, to
inflict upon him that deadly blow, the destruction of his children, so
cruelly inflicted moreover that all of either sex were destroyed at the same
moment in early youth and by a violent end, and so instantaneous was
their death that it involved their burial also. For their father neither saw
them laid upon a bed, nor kissed their hands, nor heard their last words,
nor touched their hands and knees, nor did he shut their mouths, or close
their eyes when they were about to die, acts which tend not a little to
console parents who are being parted from their children; neither did he
follow some of them to burial, and find others on his return home to
console him for those who had departed; but he heard that as they were
reclining on their couches at a banquet, a banquet full of love, not of
excess, a table of brotherly kindness, they were all overwhelmed; and
blood, and wine, the cups and the ceiling, the table, and the dust, and the
limbs of his children, were all mingled together. Nevertheless when he
heard these things, and others before these which were also distressing; for
they too had perished in a distressing way; flocks and whole herds had
been destroyed, the latter having been consumed by fire sent down from
heaven, (so said the evil messenger of this tragedy,) and the former having

been all seized together by various enemies, and cut to pieces as well as
the shepherds themselves; nevertheless I say when he saw this great storm
stirred up in a brief moment of time affecting his lands, his house, his
cattle, and his children, when he saw billow following billow, and long
lines of rocks, and the darkness was profound, and the surging waves
unbearable, even then he was not tortured by despondency, and scarcely
seemed to feel the things which had happened, save so far as he was a man
and a father. But when he was delivered over to sickness and sores, then
did he also long for death, then did he also bewail himself and lament, so
that you may understand how this kind of suffering is more severe than all
others, and this form of patience the highest of all. Nor is the Devil himself
unaware, of this fact; for when after having set in motion all these trials he
perceived that the hero remained untroubled and undismayed he rushed to
this as the greatest contest of all, saying that all the other calamities were
bearable, as loss of child, or property, or anything else (for this is what is
meant by the expression "skin for skin") but the deadly blow was when
pain was inflicted on a man's body. And therefore when he had been
worsted after this contest, he had no longer a word to utter, although on
former occasions he had made the most strenuous and shameless
resistance. In this instance however he found that he could not invent any
further shameless device, but hid his face and retreated.

3. Think not however that it is an excuse to justify you in desiring death,
that Job desired it, not being able to bear his sufferings. For consider the
time when he desired it, and the disposition of his circumstances - the
law was not given, the prophets had not appeared, grace had not been shed
forth as it was afterwards, nor had he the advantage of any other kind of
philosophy. For as a proof that more is demanded from us than from
those who lived then, and that harder tasks are assigned to us, listen to
Christ, when He says "Except your righteousness exceed the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the
kingdom of Heaven." Do not think therefore that to pray for death now is
exempt from blame, but hearken to the voice of St. Paul when he says "To
depart and to be with Christ is far better, but to abide in the flesh is more
necessary for your sake." For in proportion as the strain of the affliction is
increased are the garlands of victory multiplied; in proportion as the gold
is heated does it become purified, the longer the merchant makes his

voyage on the sea, the larger is the freight which he collects. Do not then
think that the labor now allotted to you is a slight one, but rather that it is
higher than all which you have undergone, I mean that which consists in
infirmity of body. For in the case of Lazarus (and although I may have
often said this to you, it nowise hinders me from saying it now) this
bodily infirmity availed for his salvation; and he departed to the bosom of
the man who possessed a dwelling which he shared with all who passed
by, and was continually shifting his home on account of God's command,
and sacrificed his own son, his only begotten, who had been given him in
extreme old age; although Lazarus had done none of these things yet he
obtained this blessing inasmuch as he cheerfully endured poverty, and
infirmity, and friendlessness. For this is so great a good to those who bear
anything bravely that it releases any one who may have committed the
greatest sins from the heaviest burden of them; or if any one is an upright
and just man it becomes an additional ground of the greatest confidence.
For it is a bright wreath of victory for the just, shining far above the
brightness of the sun, and it is the greatest means of purification for those
who have sinned. On this account Paul delivers the man who had made the
incestuous marriage to "destruction of the flesh," purifying him by this
means. For as a proof that what was done did purify even from so great a
stain hear his words "that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."
And when he was accusing others of another very awful sin, that of
partaking unworthily of the holy table and those secret mysteries, and had
said that such a person will be "guilty of the body and blood of the Lord,"
observe how he says that they also are purified from that grievous stain -
"therefore are many weak and sickly among you." And then by way of
proving that they will not be confined to this condition of punishment, but
that some profit will be derived from it, namely release from the penalties
to which the sin is liable, he added: "for if we would judge ourselves, we
should not be judged. But now when we are judged, we are chastened of
the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world." Moreover
that they who have lived very righteously derive much benefit from such
chastisement is plain from the case of Job, who was more illustrious after
it than before, and from the case of Timothy, who although he was such a
good man, and entrusted with such an important ministry, and made the
circuit of the world with Paul passed not two or three days, nor ten or
twenty, or a hundred, but many in succession in ill health, his body being

very seriously enfeebled. Paul shows this where he said "Use a little wine
for thy stomach's sake, and thine often infirmities." And he who raised the
dead did not cure this man's infirmity, but left him in the furnace of his
sickness so that he might therefrom contract a very great abundance of
confidence. For the lessons which Paul himself had enjoyed from his
Master, and the training which he had received from Him, he imparted to
his disciple. For although he was not subjected to bodily infirmity, yet he
was buffeted by trials not less severe, which inflicted much physical pain.
"For there was given unto me" he says "a thorn in the flesh a messenger of
Satan to buffet me" meaning by this the blows, the bonds, the chains, the
imprisonments, the being dragged about, and maltreated, and tortured by
the scourges of public executioners. Wherefore also being unable to bear
the pain occasioned to the body by these things "for this I besought the
Lord thrice (thrice here meaning many times) that I might be delivered
from this thorn." And then when he did not obtain his petition, having
learned the benefit of the trial, he held his peace, and rejoiced at the things
which happened unto him.

Therefore even if you remain at home, and are set fast in bed, do not
consider your life an idle one; for you undergo more severe pains than
those who are dragged, and maltreated, and tortured by executioners,
inasmuch as in this excessive infirmity of yours you have a perpetual
executioner residing with you.

4. Do not then now desire death, nor neglect the means of cure; for indeed
this would not be safe. On this account Paul also exhorts Timothy to take
the greatest care of himself. As regards infirmity then enough has now
been said. But if it is separation from me which causes your despondency
expect release from this. And I have not said this now merely to encourage
you, but I am sure that it really will be the case. For if it were not destined
to happen, I should long ago, so at least I think, have departed from this
world, considering the trials which have been inflicted on me. For to pass
over all that occurred in Constantinople, after my departure thence, you
may understand what sufferings I endured on that long and cruel journey,
most of which were sufficient to produce death; what I endured after my
arrival here, after my removal from Cucusus, and after my sojourn in
Arabissus. Yet I have survived all these things, and now I am in sound
health, and great security, so that all Armenians are astonished that with

such a feeble and flimsy frame as mine I can support such an intolerable
amount of cold, or that I can breathe at all, when those who are habituated
to the winter are suffering from it in no common degree. Nevertheless I
have remained uninjured up to the present day, having escaped the hands
of robbers who have repeatedly attacked us, and yet in daily want of the
necessaries of life, and deprived of the use of a bath; and although since
my sojourn here I have been constantly without this luxury I am now so
established in the habit that I do not even long for the comfort to be
derived from it, but am in sounder health than before. And neither the
inclemency of the climate, nor the desolation of the region, nor the scarcity
of provisions, nor the lack of attendants, nor the unskillfulness of
physicians, nor the deprivation of the bath, nor perpetual confinement in
one chamber as in a prison, and the impossibility of moving about which I
always used continually to need, nor perpetual contact with fire and
smoke, nor fear of robbers, nor a constant state of siege, nor anything else
of this kind has got the better of me; on the contrary I am in a sounder
condition of health than I was elsewhere, although I then received great
care and attention. Taking all these things then into consideration pray
shake off the despondency which now oppresses you, and do not exact
inordinate and cruel penances from yourself. I sent you the treatise which
I have lately written, that "no one can harm the man who does not injure
himself," and the letter which I now send your honor contends for the
same position. I beg you therefore to go over it constantly, and if your
health permits you, recite it aloud. For if you will, it may prove an
effectual remedy for you. But if you are contentious with me, and do not
try to cure yourself, and will not rouse yourself from these dismal
swamps of despondency in spite of the unlimited amount of advice and
exhortation which you enjoy I shall not on my part readily consent to
send you frequent and long letters, if you are not to derive any benefit in
the way of cheerfulness from them. How then shall I know this? not by
your merely saying so, but by a practical proof, inasmuch as you lately
affirmed that it was nothing but despondency which caused this sickness
of yours. Since then you have yourself made this confession I shall not
believe that you have got rid of your despondency unless you have got rid
of your bodily infirmity. For if it is the former which causes your
disorder, as you say in your letter, it is obvious that when that has been
dispersed the other will be removed at the same time, and when the root

has been plucked up, the branches perish with it; - and if the branches
continue flowering and flourishing, and producing an unnatural amount of
fruit I cannot believe that you have been set free from the root of your
distress. Therefore do not show me words but facts, and, if you get well,
you will see letters sent to you again exceeding the limits of former
communications. Deem it then no small consolation that I am alive, and in
good health, and that in the midst of such circumstances I have been set
free from sickness and infirmity, which, as I know, is a great annoyance
and vexation to my enemies. It follows therefore that you should deem
this the greatest encouragement, and the crown of your consolation. Do
not call your household desolate, which has now a higher place assigned to
it in Heaven by reason of the sufferings which it endures. I was grievously
distressed on account of Pelagius the monk. Consider therefore what great
rewards they deserve who bravely hold their ground, when men who pass
their time in such a habit of disci line and endurance are found susceptible
of degradation.

TO OLYMPIAS

HAVING risen from the very gates of death I address this letter to the
discreet lady; and I am very glad that thy servants have met me just as I
am anchoring at last in harbor. For had they met me when I was still
tossing on the open sea, and experiencing the cruel waves of bodily
sickness, it would not have been easy for me to deceive your cautious
spirit, by sending good tidings instead of sorrowful. For the winter, which
has become more than commonly severe, brought on a storm of internal
disorder even more distressing, and during the last two months I have been
no better than one dead, nay worse. For I had just enough life to be
sensible of the horrors which encircled me, and day and dawn and noon
were all one night to me as I spent all my time closely confined to my bed,
and in spite of endless contrivances I could not shake off the pernicious
effects of the cold; but although I kept a fire burning, and endured a most
unpleasant amount of smoke, and remained cooped up in one chamber,
covered with any quantity of wraps, and not daring to set a foot outside
the threshold I underwent extreme sufferings, perpetual vomiting
supervening on headache, loss of appetite, and constant sleeplessness.

Thus restlessly did I pass through my long dark sea of troubles But not to
distress thy mind by dwelling upon my miseries, from all of them I am
now relieved. For as soon as spring approached, and a little change in the
temperature took place, all my troubles spontaneously vanished.
Nevertheless I still require great care as regards diet; therefore I put only a
light load on my stomach, so that it may be able to digest it easily. But it
has occasioned me no little concern to learn that my discreet mistress was
brought to the verge of death. Nevertheless in consideration of my great
affection, and anxiety, and solicitude for your welfare I was relieved from
this care, even before the arrival of your letters, many persons having
come from thence who brought me tidings of your restoration to health.

And now I am exceedingly glad and delighted to hear, not only that you
have been released from your infirmity, but above all that you bear the
things which befall you so bravely, calling them all but an idle tale; and,
which is indeed a greater matter, that you have applied this name even to
your bodily infirmity, which is an evidence of a robust spirit, rich in the
fruit of courage. For not only to bear misfortunes bravely-but to be
actually insensible to them, to overlook them, and with such little exertion
to wreathe your brows with the garland prize of patience, neither laboring,
nor toiling, neither feeling distress nor causing it to others, but as it were
leaping and dancing for joy all the while, this is indeed a proof of the most
finished philosophy. Therefore I rejoice, and leap for joy; I am in a flutter
of delight, I am insensible to my present loneliness, and the other troubles
which surround me, being cheered, and brightened, and not a little proud
on account of your greatness of soul, and the repeated victories which you
have won, and this, not only for your own sake, but also for the sake of
that large and populous city, where you are like a tower, a haven, and a
wall of defense, speaking in the eloquent voice of example, and through
your sufferings instructing either sex to strip readily for these contests,
and descend into the lists with all courage, and cheerfully bear the toils
which such contests involve. And the wonder is that without thrusting
yourself into the forum, or occupying the public centers of the city, but
sitting all the while in a small house and confined chamber you serve and
anoint the combatants for the contest, and whilst the sea is thus raging
round you, and the billows are rising to a crest, and crags and reefs, and
rocky ledges and fierce monsters appear on every side, and everything is

shrouded in the most profound darkness you setting the sails of patience,
float on with great serenity, as if it was noonday, and calm weather, and a
favorable breeze wafting you on, and so far from being overwhelmed by
this grievous tempest are not even sprinkled by the spray; and very
naturally so; such is the force of virtue as a rudder. Now merchants and
pilots, and sailors and voyagers when they see clouds gathering up, or
fierce winds rushing down upon them, or the breakers seething with an
abundance of foam keep their vessels moored inside harbor; and if they
chance to be tempest-tossed in the open sea they do their best, and devise
every means to bring their ship to some anchorage, or island or shore. But
you, although such innumerable winds, and fierce waves burst upon you
together, and the sea is heaved up from its very depths owing to the
severity of the storm, and some are submerged, others floating dead upon
the water, others drifting naked upon planks, you plunging into the mid
ocean of calamities call all these things an idle tale, sailing on with a
favorable breeze in the midst of the tempest; and naturally so; for pilots,
even if they are infinitely wise in that science, nevertheless have not skill
sufficient to withstand every kind of storm; consequently they often
shrink from doing battle with the waves. But the science which you have
is superior to every kind of storm - the power of a philosophic soul -
which is stronger than ten thousand armies, more powerful than arms, and
more secure than towers and bulwarks. For the arms, and bulwarks, and
towers which soldiers have, are serviceable for the security of the body
only, and this not always, nor in every way; but there are times when all
these resources are baffled, and leave those who fly to them for refuge
destitute of protection. But thy powers do not repel the weapons of
barbarians, nor the devices of hostile men, nor any assaults and stratagems
of that kind, but they have trampled under foot the constraining forces of
nature, put down their tyranny and leveled their citadel. And whilst
ceaselessly contending with demons, you have won countless victories,
yet have not received a single blow, but stand unwounded in the midst of a
storm of darts and turn the spears which are hurled at you back upon
those who discharge them. Such is the wisdom of your art; by the
sufferings which you undergo you take vengeance on those who inflict
them; by the plots of which you are the subject you put your enemies to
pain, possessing in their malice the best foundation for the materials of
fame. And you, knowing these things well yourself, and having gained

perception by experience, naturally call them all an idle tale. For how,
pray, should you not call them by that name, possessing as you do a
mortal body, and yet despising death as if you were hastening to quit a
foreign country, and return to your own land; a chronic sufferer from the
most severe infirmity, and yet more cheerfully disposed than the thriving
and robust, not depressed by insults, nor elated by honors and glory, the
latter being a cause of infinite mischief to many who after an illustrious
career in the priesthood, and after reaching extreme old age, and the most
venerable hoar hairs, have fallen into disgrace on this account, and become
a common spectacle of derision for those who wish to make merry. But
you on the contrary, woman as you are, clothed with a fragile body, and
subject to these severe attacks, have not only avoided falling into such a
condition yourself, but have prevented many others from so doing. They
indeed before they had advanced far in the contest, even at the very outset
and starting point, have been overthrown; whereas you, after having gone
countless times round the farther turning post, have won a prize in every
course, after playing your part in manifold kinds of wrestling and combats.
And very naturally so; for the wrestlings of virtue do not depend upon
age, or bodily strength, but only on the spirit and the disposition. Thus
women have been crowned victors, while men have been upset; so also
boys have been proclaimed conquerors. while aged men have been put to
shame. It is indeed always fitting to admire those who pursue virtue, but
especially when some are found to cling to it at a time when many are
deserting it. Therefore, my sweet lady, you deserve superlative
admiration, inasmuch as after so many men, women, and aged persons
who seemed to enjoy the greatest reputation have been turned to flight, all
lying prostrate before the eyes of the world, and this not after a severe
onslaught, nor any alarming muster of the enemy's force, but overthrown
before the encounter and worsted before the struggle, you on the contrary
after so many battles and such large muster of the enemy are so far from
being unstrung, or dismayed by the number of your adversities, that you
are all the more vigorous, and the increase of the contest gives you an
increase of strength. For the recollection of what has been already achieved
becomes the ground of cheerfulness, and joy, and greater zeal. Therefore I
rejoice, and leap for joy; for I will not cease repeating this, and taking
about with me everywhere the material of my joy; so that although my
separation from you distresses you, yet you have this very great

consolation arising from your successful exploits; for I also who am
banished to so great a distance gain no small cheerfulness from this cause,
- I mean your courage.

TO OLYMPIAS

WHY do you lament? why do you belabor yourself, and demand of
yourself a punishment which your enemies were not able to demand from
you, having thus abandoned your soul to the tyranny of dejection? For the
letters which you sent to me by the hands of Patricius have discovered to
me the wounds which have been inflicted on your mind. Wherefore also I
am very sorrowful and much distressed that when you ought to be using
every exertion and making it your business to expel dejection from your
soul, you go about collecting distressing thoughts, even inventing things
(so you say) which do not exist, and tearing yourself to pieces for no
purpose, and to your very great injury. For why are you grieved because
you could not remove me from Cucusus? Yet indeed, as far as you were
concerned, you did remove me, having made every exertion and endeavor
for this purpose. And even if it has not been actually accomplished you
ought not to be vexed on that account. For perhaps it seemed good to God
that I should be set to run the longer double course, in order that the
garland of victory might be rendered more glorious. Why then are you
vexed on account of these things, in consequence of which my fame is
spread abroad, when you ought to leap and dance for joy and bind wreaths
upon your brow, because I have been deemed worthy of so great an honor
which far exceeds my merits? Is it the desolation of this place which
grieves you? Yet what can be pleasanter than my sojourn here? I have
quietness, and tranquillity, plenty of leisure and good bodily health. For
although the town has neither market-place nor market that is nothing to
me. For all things are poured abundantly upon me as out of a flowing
spring. I find my Lord the Bishop here and my Lord Dioscorus are
constantly employed in providing for my refreshment. And the good
Patricius will tell you that as far as my sojourn here is concerned I pass
my time cheerfully and gladly, surrounded by attention. But if you lament
the events which occurred in Caesarea, here again your conduct is
unworthy of yourself. For there also bright garlands of victory were

woven for me, inasmuch as all were proclaiming and publishing my
praises, and expressing wonder and astonishment at the ill-treatment to
which I had been subjected followed by expulsion. Meanwhile however do
not let any one know these things, although they are the theme of much
gossip. For my Lord Poeanius has disclosed to me that the presbyters of
Pharetrius himself have arrived on the spot, who declare that they were in
communion with me and had no communication or intercourse or
partnership with my adversaries. Therefore to avoid upsetting them do
not let any one know these things. For certainly the things which befell me
were very grievous: and if I had not suffered any other distress the events
which happened there would have sufficed to procure innumerable
rewards for me: so extreme was the danger which I encountered. Now I
beseech you to keep these matters secret, and so I will give you a short
account of them, not in order to grieve you but rather to make you glad.
For herein consists the material of my gain, herein consists my wealth,
herein the means of getting rid of my sins - that my journey is
continually encompassed by trials of this kind, and that they are inflicted
upon me by persons from whom they were quite unexpected. For when I
was about to enter the region of Cappadocia, having escaped from that
man of Galatia, who nearly threatened me with death, many persons met
me on the way saying "the Lord Pharetrius is awaiting you, and going
about in all directions for fear of missing the pleasure of meeting you, and
making every possible endeavor to see you, and embrace you, and show
you all manner of affectionate regard; and he has set the monasteries of
men and women in motion for this purpose. Now when I heard these
things I did not expect that any of them would really take place, but
formed an impression in my own mind precisely the reverse: but of this I
said nothing to any of those who brought me this message.

2. Now when I arrived late one evening at Caesarea, in an exhausted and
worn-out condition, being in the very height of a burning fever, faint and
suffering to the last degree, I lighted upon an inn situated just at the
outskirts of the city, and took great pains to find some physicians and
allay this fiery fever; for it was now the height of my tertian malady. And
in addition to this there was the fatigue of the journey, the toil, the strain,
the total absence of attendants, the difficulty of getting supplies, the want
of a physician, the wasting effects of toil, and heat and sleeplessness; thus

I was well nigh a dead man when I entered the city. Then indeed I was
visited by the whole body of the clergy, and the people, monks, nuns,
physicians, and I had the benefit of great attention, as all paid me every
kind of ministration and assistance. Yet even thus, being oppressed by the
lethargy arising from the feverish heat I was in an extremely distressed
condition. At length by degrees the malady was coming to an end and
abating. Pharetrius however nowhere appeared; but waited for my
departure, I know not with what purpose in view. When then I saw that
my disorder had slightly abated I began to form plans for my journey so as
to reach Cucusus, and enjoy a little repose after the calamities of the way.
And whilst I was thus situated it was suddenly announced that the
Isaurians in countless multitudes were overrunning the district of Caesarea,
and had burnt a large village, and were most violently disposed. The
tribune, having heard this, took the soldiers which he had and went out.
For they were afraid lest the enemy should make an assault also upon the
city, and all were in terror, and in an agony of alarm the very soil of their
country being in Jeopardy, so that even the old men undertook the defense
of the walls. While affairs were in this condition suddenly towards dawn a
rabble of monks (for so I must call them, indicating their frenzy by the
expression) rushed up to the house where we were, threatening to set fire
to it, and to treat us with the utmost violence unless we turned out of it.
And neither the fear of the Isaurians, nor my own infirmity which was so
grievously afflicting me, nor anything else made them more reasonable, but
they pressed on, animated by such fierce rage that even the proconsular
soldiers were terrified. For they kept threatening them with blows and
boasted that they had shamefully beaten many of the proconsular soldiers.
The soldiers having heard these things, sought refuge with me, and
entreated and beseeched me, saying "even if we are to fall into the hands of
the Isaurians deliver us from these wild beasts." When the governor heard
this he hastened down to the house intending to succor me. But the monks
would not pay any heed to his exhortations, and in fact he was powerless.
Perceiving the great strait in which affairs were placed and not daring to
advise me either to go out to certain death, or on the other hand to stay
indoors, owing to the excessive fury of these men, he sent to Pharetrius
beseeching him to grant a few days respite on account of my infirmity and
the impending danger. But even then nothing was effected, and on the
morrow the monks arrived even fiercer than before, and none of the

presbyters dared to stand by me and help me, but covered with shame and
blushes (for they said that these things were done by the instructions of
Pharetrius) they concealed themselves and lay hid, not responding even
when I called them. What need to make a long story? Although such great
terrors were imminent, and death well nigh a certainty, and the fever was
oppressing me (for I had not yet got relief from the troubles arising from
that cause) I flung myself at high noon into the litter, and was carried out
thence, all the people shrieking and howling, and imprecating curses on the
perpetrator of these deeds, whilst every one wailed and lamented. But
when I got outside the city, some of the clergy also gradually came out and
escorted me, mourning as they went. And having heard some persons say
"Where are you leading him away to manifest death?" one of those who
was warmly attached to me said to me "Depart I entreat you; fall into the
hands of the Isaurians, provided you get clear away from us. For wherever
you may fall, you will fall into a place of security, if only you escape our
hands." Having heard and seen these things the good Seleucia, the generous
wife of my Lord Ruffinus (a most attentive friend she was to me),
exhorted and entreated me to lodge at her suburban house which was about
five miles from the city and she sent some men to escort me, and so I
departed thither.

3. But not even there was this plot against me to come to an end. For as
soon as Pharetrius knew what she had done, he published, as she said
many threats against her. But when she received me into her suburban villa
I knew nothing of these things; for when she came out to meet me she
concealed these things from me, but disclosed them to her steward who
was there, and ordered him to afford me every possible means of repose,
and if any of the monks should make an assault, wishing to insult or
maltreat me, he was to collect the laborers from her other farms, and thus
marshal a force against them. Moreover she besought me to take refuge in
her house, which had a fortress and was impregnable, that I might escape
the hands of the bishop and monks. This however I could not be induced
to do, but remained in the villa, knowing nothing of the plans which were
devised after these things. For even then they were not content to desist
from their fury against me but Pharetrius beset the lady as she says,
straitly threatening her, constraining and forcing her to expel me even from
the suburbs, so that at midnight, I knowing nothing of these things, the

lady being unable to endure his annoyance, announced, without my
knowledge, that the barbarians were at hand, for she was ashamed to
mention the compulsion which she had undergone. So in the middle of the
night Evethius the presbyter came to me, and having roused me from
sleep, exclaimed with a loud voice "Get up, I pray you, the barbarians are
upon us, they are dose at hand." Imagine my condition on hearing this!
Then, when I said to him what must we do? we cannot take refuge in the
city lest we suffer worse things than what the Isaurians are going to do to
us, he compelled me to go out. It was midnight, a dark, murky night
without a moon - a circumstance which filled up the measure of our
perplexity - we had no companion, no assistant, for all had deserted us.
Nevertheless under the pressure of fear and in the expectation of
immediate death, I got up, suffering as I was, having ordered torches to be
lit. These however the presbyter ordered to be put out, for fear as he said
lest the barbarians should be attracted by the light and attack us; so the
torches were extinguished. Then the mule which carried my litter fell on its
knees, the road being rugged, and steep and stony, and I who was inside
was thrown down and narrowly escaped destruction, after which I
dismounted, and was dragged along on foot, being held fast by Evethius
the presbyter (for he also had alighted from his mule), and so I plodded on,
led, or rather hauled by the hand, for to walk was impossible through such
a difficult country, and amongst steep mountains in the middle of the
night. Imagine what my sufferings must have been, encompassed as I was
by such calamities, and oppressed by the fever, ignorant of the plans
which had been made, but in terror of the barbarians and trembling. with
the expectation of falling into their hands. Do you not think that these
sufferings alone, even if nothing else besides had befallen me, would avail
to blot out many of my sins, and afford ample material for obtaining praise
with God? Now the reason of all this, at least as I suppose, was, that as
soon as I arrived in Caesarea, those who were in official positions, the
learned men who were ex-vicars, and ex-governors, the ex-tribunes and
indeed the whole people visited me every day, paid me great attention, and
treated me as the apple of their eye; I suppose these things irritated
Pharetrius and that the envy which drove me from Constantinople did not
refrain from pursuing me even here. This at least is what I suppose, for I
do not positively declare it but only suspect it to be the fact.

And what is one to say about the other events which happened on the
way, the fears and the perils? as I recall them day by day, and continually
bear them in mind, I am elated with pleasure, I leap for joy as one who has
a great treasure laid up in store for him; for such is my position and feeling
about them. Wherefore also I beseech your Honor to rejoice at these
things, to be glad, and leap for joy, and to glorify God who has counted me
worthy to suffer such things And I beseech you to keep these matters to
yourself, and not to divulge them to any one, although for the most part
the proconsular soldiers can fill all the city (with the story) as they
themselves have undergone extreme danger.

4. Nevertheless do not let any one know this from your prudence, but
rather put down those who talk about it. But if you are distressed lest the
consequences of my ill-treatment should remain, know for certain that I
have shaken myself entirely free from them, and that I am in better bodily
health than when I was sojourning in Caesarea. And why do you dread the
cold? for a suitable dwelling has been prepared for me, and my Lord
Dioscorus does and arranges everything so as to prevent my having the
least sensation of cold. And if I may form a conjecture from the outset of
my experience, the climate now seems to me oriental in character, no less
than that of Antioch. So great is the warmth, so pleasant is the
temperature. But you have grieved me much by saying, "perhaps you are
annoyed with me as having neglected you," yet I dispatched a letter many
days ago to your honor begging you not to move me from this place. Now
I have had occasion to consider that you need a strong defense and much
toil and labor to be able to make a satisfactory apology for this expression.
But perhaps you have made a partial apology, by saying "I am generally
occupied in thinking how to increase my affliction." But I in my turn
reckon it as the greatest accusation that you should say "I take a pride in
increasing my sorrow by thinking over it:" for when you ought to make
every possible effort to dispel your affliction you do the devil's will, by
increasing your despondency and sorrow. Are you not aware how great an
evil despondency is?

As to the Isaurians, dismiss your fears in future concerning them: for they
have returned into their own country: and the governor has done
everything necessary in this respect; and I am in far greater security here
than when I was in Caesarea. For in future I have no one to fear so much

as the bishops, with a few exceptions. On account of the Isaurians then
fear nothing: for they have retreated, and when winter has set in they are
confined to their own homes, although they may possibly come out after
Whitsuntide. And what do you mean by saying that you have not the
benefit of letters from me? I have already sent you three long letters, one
by the proconsular soldiers, one by Antonius, and the third by Anatolius
my servant; two of them were a salutary medicine capable of reviving any
one who was desponding or stumbling, and conducting him into a healthy
state of serenity. When you have received these letters then go over them
constantly and thoroughly, and you will perceive their force and enjoy
experience of their healing power, and benefit, and will inform me that you
have derived much advantage therefrom. I have also a third letter ready,
similar to these, which I do not choose to send at the present time having
been exceedingly vexed at your saying "I accumulate sorrowful thoughts,
even inventing things which do not exist," an utterance unworthy of
yourself, which makes me hide my head for shame. But read those letters
which I have sent, and you will no longer say these things, even if you are
infinitely bent on being despondent. I at least have not ceased, and will not
cease saying that sin is the only thing which is really distressing; and that
all other things are but dust and smoke. For what is there grievous in
inhabiting a prison and wearing a chain? or in being ill-treated when it is
the occasion of so much gain? or why should exile be grievous or
confiscation of goods? These are mere words, destitute of any terrible
reality, words void of sorrow. For if you speak of death you only mention
that which is the debt of nature: a thing which must in any case be
undergone even if no one hastens it: and if you speak of exile you mention
that which only involves a change of country and the sight of many cities:
or if you speak of confiscation of goods you mention what is only
freedom and emancipation from care.

5. Do not cease to pay attention to Maruthas the Bishop, as far as it
concerns you, so as to lift him up out of the pit. For I have special need of
him on account of the affairs in Persia. And ascertain from him, if you can,
what has been accomplished there through his agency, and for what
purpose he has come home, and let me know whether you have delivered
the two epistles which I sent to him: and if he is willing to write to me, I
will write again to him: but if he should not be willing let him at least

signify to your prudence whether any thing more has taken place there,
and whether he is likely to accomplish anything by going thither again. For
on this account I was anxious to have an interview with him. Nevertheless
let all things which depend on you be done, and take care to fulfill your
own part, even if all men are rushing headlong to ruin. For your reward
will thus be perfected. By all means therefore make friends with him as far
as it is possible. I beseech you not to neglect what I am about to say, but
to pay diligent heed to it. The Marsian and Gothic monks where the
Bishop Serapion has constantly been concealed have informed me that
Moduarius the deacon has come bringing word that Unilas, that excellent
bishop whom I lately ordained and sent into Gothia, has been laid to rest,
after achieving many great exploits: and the deacon was the bearer of a
letter from the king of the Goths begging that a bishop might be sent to
them. Since then I see no other means of meeting the threatened
catastrophe with a view to its correction save delay and postponement (as
it is impossible for them to sail into the Bosporus or into those parts at
the present time), take measures to put them off for a time on account of
the winter season: and do not by any means neglect this: for it is a matter
of the greatest importance. For there are two things which would specially
distress me if they were to happen, which God forbid: one is that a bishop
should be appointed by these men who have wrought such great
wickedness, and who have no right to appoint, and the other is that any
one should be made without consideration. For you know yourself that
they are not anxious to create some worthy man bishop, and if this should
take place, which heaven forbid, you are aware what will follow. Use all
diligence therefore to prevent either of these things happening: but if it
were possible for Moduarius quietly and secretly to hasten out to me it
would be of the greatest advantage. But if this is not possible let what is
practicable under the circumstances be done. For that which takes place in
the case of money, and actually occurred in the case of the widow in the
gospel, also holds good in the case of practical affairs. For as that poor
woman when she had cast two mites into the treasury surpassed all those
who had cast in more, because she used up her whole substance: even so
they who devote themselves to the work in hand with all their might
discharge it completely, so far as they are concerned, even if nothing
results from it, and they have their reward perfected.

I am very grateful to Hilarius the bishop: for he wrote to me asking to be
allowed to depart to his own country, and to set things in order there, and
then to come back again. As his presence therefore is of great service (for
he is a devout, inflexible, and zealous man) I have urged him to depart and
to return speedily. Take care then that the letter is quickly and safely
delivered to him and not cast on one side: for he eagerly and earnestly
begged for letters from me, and his presence is a great benefit. By all means
therefore have a care of the letters; and if Helladius the presbyter be not on
the spot see that they are delivered to my friends by the hands of some
discreet man who has a head on his shoulders.

TO OLYMPIAS

NOTHING strange or unnatural has befallen your Piety, but only what is
quite natural and consonant to reason, that by a constant succession of
trials the sinews of your soul should become more braced, and your zeal
and energy for the struggle increased, and that you should therefrom derive
much joy. For such is the nature of affliction; - when it lays hold of a
brave and noble soul, this is what it is wont to effect. And as the fire
makes the piece of gold, when it is applied to it, of better proof: so also
affliction when it visits golden characters renders them purer and more
proven. Wherefore also Paul said "affliction worketh patience, and
patience probation." For these reasons I also rejoice and leap for joy, and
derive the greatest consolation of this my solitude from a consideration of
thy fortitude. On this account, even though innumerable wolves
encompass thee, and many crowds of wicked doers, I fear nothing; but I
pray both that existing temptations may be suppressed, and that others
may not occur, thus fulfilling the Lord's precept who bids us pray that we
may not enter into temptation; but if it should be permitted to happen
again I have good confidence concerning thy golden soul, which acquires
therefrom the greatest riches for itself. For by what means will they be
able to terrify you, who dare everything to their own destruction? Will it
be by loss of goods? But I know well that these are counted by thee as
dust and cheaper than dirt. Or shall it be by expulsion from country and
home. But you know how to dwell in great and populous cities as if they
were uninhabited, spending the whole of your time in quietness and rest,

and treading worldly ambitions under foot. Or do they threaten death?
This also you have constantly practiced by anticipation, and if they
should drag you to slaughter, they will be dragging a body which is already
dead. What need to speak more at length? No one will be able to do
anything to thee of this kind which he will not find you have already
abundantly made yourself undergo. For by always walking in the narrow
and strait path, you have trained yourself in all these things. Wherefore
having practiced this most beautiful art in the course of your training, you
now shine forth the more gloriously in the contest itself, not only being in
no wise disturbed by the things which are happening, but rather elated,
and leaping and dancing for joy. For the contests which you have
anticipated in your training you now undertake with much ease, although
it be in a woman's body, feebler than a cobweb, treading under foot with
derisive scorn the fury of lusty men gnashing their teeth upon you; being
ready to suffer even worse things than they prepare for you. Happy and
thrice happy are you by reason of the crowns of victory to be won, but
even more by reason of the contest itself. For such is the nature of these
struggles, even before the prizes are given even in the midst of strife they
have their recompense and reward; - the pleasure which you are now
enjoying, the cheerfulness, the courage, the endurance, the patience, the
power which is proof against capture and conquest and rises superior to
all things; the perfect training which renders you insensible to any terror at
the hands of any one, the power of standing on a rock in the midst of
mighty billows of tribulation, and sailing in a calm with a favorable breeze
when the sea is raging around you. These are the prizes of affliction even
in this world before the kingdom of heaven is won. For I know very well
that, even at this present time, being elated with joy, thou dost not
consider thyself clothed with a body, but if an opportunity should
summon thee to do it, thou wouldst divest thyself of it more readily than
others do of the raiment which they wear. Rejoice therefore and be glad
both for thyself, and for those who have died a blessed death, not in a bed,
nor in a house, but in prison, and chains, and torment; and bewail those
only who do these things, and grieve for them. But since you also wish to
be informed concerning my bodily health, let me tell you that I have been
relieved for the present from the infirmity which was lately oppressing
me, and am now in a more comfortable condition: the only fear is lest the

winter on its return should again make havoc of my feeble digestion; and as
far as the Isaurians are concerned we now enjoy great security.

The following letter is added as a specimen, out of a very large number, of
the natural, almost playful style, and tone of warm affection, in which
Chrysostom wrote to his intimate friends. All his extant letters were
written during his exile, and therefore there is much repetition in their
contents, and great general similarity of character.

TO CASTUS, VALERIUS, DIOPHANTUS,
CYRIACUS,

PRESBYTERS OF ANTIOCH

I AM not surprised that you call my long letter a short one. For this is just
the way with lovers; they do not recognize such a thing as satiety, they
will not admit such a thing as satisfaction, but the more they receive from
the objects of their love the more they seek. Therefore, even if the letter
which you have received had been ten times as large as the former one, it
would not have escaped the epithet of "brief;" in fact it would have been
called a small letter, and not only would it have been so called, but it
would have actually seemed such in your eyes. Hence I also in my turn am
never satisfied with the measure of affection for me which you have
attained, but am always seeking to make additions to your love-draught,
and daily demanding the discharge of your love debt which is always being
paid, and yet is always owing (for it is written, "owe no man anything but
to love one another"). I am indeed continually receiving what I ask in great
abundance, yet never think that I have received the whole. Do not cease
then to pay down this goodly debt, which has a twofold pleasure. For
those who pay, and those who receive, derive equal enjoyment, inasmuch
as they are both alike enriched by the payment; which in the case of
money is an impossibility, for there the one who pays becomes poorer,
and only the man who has received is richer. But this is not what
commonly happens in the covenant of love. For he who pays it is not less
bereft of it, as in the case of money when it is transferred to the receiver;
but payment of love makes him who pays richer than before. Knowing

these things then, O Sirs, most honored and devout, cease not continually
displaying this excellent disposition towards me. For although you need
no exhortation for this purpose from me yet as I greatly long for your love
I remind you, even when you need it not, both in order that you may
constantly write to me, and also inform me of the state of your health. For
even if you do not need any one to remind you on this account, I shall not
desist from continually seeking this at your hands; as it is a matter which I
have very much at heart. That it is a difficult task owing both to the
season of the year, and the difficulty of the journey, and the scarcity of
travelers who will do this service for you I am well aware: nevertheless as
far as is possible and practicable in the midst of so much difficulty, we
exhort you to write constantly, and crave this favor from your love.

CORRESPONDENCE OF ST. CHRYSOSTOM

WITH THE

BISHOP OF ROME

TRANSLATED BY

REV. W. R. STEPHENS, M.A.,

PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL, AND RECTOR
OF WOOLBEDING, SUSSEX.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CORRESPONDENCE OF
ST. CHRYSOSTOM, AND THE CHURCH
AT CONSTANTINOPLE, WITH INNOCENT, BISHOP OF ROME

Of these four letters the last three were written during the final exile of St.
Chrysostom from Constantinople. The first was written a few weeks
before his departure. The complication of events which led to that exile
cannot be unfolded here. The student will find a full account of them in
most historians of this period of the Church, both ancient and modern, and
in the Life of St. Chrysostom by the editor of this volume chapters XVIXIX. It must suffice to say here that Theophilus Patriarch of Alexandria
having been summoned by an imperial mandate to Constantinople to be
tried on the charge of having cruelly ill-treated certain Egyptian monks,
formed a cabal amongst the enemies of St. Chrysostom, and artfully
contrived to change his own position from that of the accused into that of
the accuser. His devices were in the end only too successful, and in the
summer of the year 404 St. Chrysostom was driven from his see, never to
return.

The first letter of St. Chrysostom seems to have been written soon after
Easter 404 and refers to the events immediately preceding his expulsion.

The second was written, as we learn from the letter itself, after he had
entered the third year of his exile, probably near the close of the year 406.

Copies of the first letter were addressed also to Venerius Bishop of Milan,
and Chromatius Bishop of Aquileia. It is interesting therefore as indicating
the relation between the Eastern and Western branches of the Church at
the beginning of the fifth century. On the one hand it illustrates the
growing tendency of Christendom to appeal to the authority of the
Western Church, especially of the Bishop of Rome, on questions of
ecclesiastical discipline. The law-making, law-protecting spirit of the West
is invoked to restrain the turbulence and licentiousness of the East. No
jealousy is entertained of the Patriarch of the old Rome by the Patriarch of
the new. But on the other hand as it is to be noted that the Bishop of
Rome is in no sense addressed as a supreme arbitrator; aid and sympathy
are solicited from him as from an elder brother, and two other prelates of
Italy are joint recipients with him of the appeal.

To Chrysostom Innocent writes, as friend to friend and bishop to brother
bishop, a letter of Christian consolation and encouragement, not entering
into the legal questions of the case, and not pledging himself to decisive
action of any kind. In his letter to the Church of Constantinople he
denounces the illegality of the late proceedings of Theophilus and his
accomplices, in the strongest terms; but insists upon the necessity of
convoking an oecumenical council as the only means of allaying the
tempest. And it must be allowed that he did his best to accomplish this
object. He wrote a letter to Honorius, the Emperor of the Western Empire,
who resided at Ravenna, describing the pitiable condition of the Church at
Constantinople. The Emperor issued an order for the convention of an
Italian synod, and the synod, swayed no doubt by Innocent, requested
Honorius to write to his brother Arcadius the Eastern Emperor urging the
convention of a general council to be held in Thessalonica which would be
a convenient meeting-point for the prelates of East and West. Honorius
complied, and the letter was despatched under the care of a deputation
from the Italian Church, consisting of five bishops, two priests and a
deacon. They were the bearers also of letters from Innocent, and the
Bishops of Milan and Aquileia, and of a memorial from the Italian synod,
recommending that Chrysostom should be reinstated in his see before he
was required to take his trial before the Council. The party hostile to
Chrysostom however had now such complete sway over the court at
Constantinople that the deputation never succeeded in getting an audience
with the Emperor, and after suffering many insults and indignities,
returned to Italy without having accomplished anything.

The letters of Innocent were probably written in Latin, and afterwards
translated into Greek. The Greek version is in several passages clumsy and
obscure.

CORRESPONDENCE OF ST. CHRYSOSTOM WITH
THE BISHOP OF ROME

LETTER FROM ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM TO INNOCENT,
BISHOP OF ROME

To My Lord, The Most Reverend And Divinely Beloved Bishop
Innocent, John Sends Greeting In The Lord.

1. I SUPPOSE that even before receiving our letter your Piety has heard of
the iniquity which has been perpetrated here. For the magnitude of our
distress has left scarcely a single portion of the world uninformed of this
grievous tragedy: for report carrying the tidings of what has happened to
the very extremities of the earth, has everywhere caused great mourning
and lamentation. But inasmuch as we ought not to mourn, but to restore
order, and to see by what means this most grievous storm of the Church
may be stayed, we have deemed it necessary to persuade my lords, the
most honored and pious bishops Demetrius, Pansophius, Pappus and
Eugenius to leave their own churches, and venture on this great sea voyage,
and set out on a long journey from home, and hasten to your Charity, and,
after informing you clearly of everything, to take measures for redressing
the evils as speedily as possible. And with them we have sent the most
honored and beloved of our Deacons, Paulus and Cyriacus, but we also
ourselves, in the form of a letter, will briefly instruct your Charity
concerning the things which have come to pass. For Theophilus, who has
been entrusted with the presidency of the Church in Alexandria, having
been commanded to repair alone to Constantinople, certain men having
brought an accusation against him to the most devout Emperor, arrived
bringing with him no small multitude of Egyptian Bishops, as if wishing to
show from the outset, that he came for war and antagonism; moreover
when he set foot in the great and divinely beloved Constantinople he did
not enter the Church according to the custom and the law which has
prevailed from ancient time, he held no intercourse with us, and admitted
us to no share in his conversation, his prayers, or his society: but as soon
as he disembarked, having hurried past the vestibule of the Church, he
departed and lodged somewhere outside the city, and although we

earnestly entreated him, and those who had come with him, to be our
guests (for everything had been made ready, and lodgings provided, and
whatever was suitable) neither they, nor he consented. We seeing this,
were in great perplexity, not being able to discover the cause of this unjust
hostility; nevertheless we discharged our part, doing what became us, and
continually beseeching him to meet us and to say for what cause he
hazarded so great a contest at the outset, and threw the city into such
confusion. But as he did not choose to state the reason, and those who
accused him were urgent, our most devout Emperor summoned us and
commanded us to go outside the walls to the place where Theophilus was
sojourning, and hear the argument against him. For they accused him of
assault, and slaughter and countless other crimes; but knowing as we did
the laws of the fathers, and paying respect and deference to the man, and
having also his own letters which prove that lawsuits ought not to be
taken beyond the border, but that the affairs of the several provinces
should be treated within the limits of the province, we would not accept
the office of judge, but deprecated it with great earnestness. But he, as if
striving to aggravate the former insults, having summoned my archdeacon,
by a stretch of arbitrary power, as if the Church were already widowed,
and had no bishop, by means of this man seduced all the clergy to his own
side; and the Churches became destitute, as the clergy in each were
gradually withdrawn, and instructed to hand in petitions against us, and
trained to prepare accusations. And having done this he sent and
summoned us to trial, although he had not yet cleared himself of the
charges brought against him, a proceeding directly contrary to the canons
and to all the laws.

2. But we being aware that we were not cited to a trial (for otherwise we
would have presented ourselves any number of times) but to the presence
of an enemy and an adversary, as was clearly proved by all which occurred
both before and after, dispatched certain bishops to him, Demetrius of
Pesinus, Eulysius of Apamea, Lupicinus of Appiaria, and the presbyters
Germanus and Severus, who replied with the moderation which became us,
and said, that we did not decline to be judged, but to appear before an
open enemy, and manifest adversary. For how could one who had not yet
received any bills of indictment against me, and had acted from the outset
in the manner described, and severed himself from the Church, from

communion, and from prayer, and was training accusers, and seducing the
clergy, and desolating the Church, how, I say, could he with justice mount
the throne of the judge which was not in any sense befitting him? For it is
not suitable that one who belongs to Egypt should act as judge of those
who are in Thrace, and this a man who is himself under an accusation, and
an enemy and adversary. Nevertheless he, in no way abashed, but hurrying
on to the completion of his design, although we had declared our readiness
to clear ourselves of the charges in the presence of a hundred yea or a
thousand bishops, and to prove ourselves innocent as indeed we are,
would not consent: but in our absence, when we were appealing to a
synod, and demanding a trial, and not shrinking from a hearing of our
cause, but only from open enmity, he both received our accusers and
absolved those who had been excommunicated by me, and from them, who
had not yet cleared themselves of the offenses laid to their charge, he
received complaints against me, and had minutes made of the proceedings,
all which things are contrary to law, and the order of the canons. But what
need is there of a long story? He did not cease doing and contriving
everything until, with all possible display of arbitrary power and
authority, he ejected us from the city and the church, when the evening
was far advanced and all the people were streaming after us. Being drawn
by the public informer through the midst of the city, and dragged along by
force I was taken down to the sea, and thrust on board ship, and made a
night voyage, because I appealed to a synod for a just hearing of my cause.
Who could hear these things without tears, even if he had a heart of stone?

But seeing, as I said before, that we ought not merely to lament the evils
which have been done, but also to amend them, I beseech your Charity to
rouse yourself and have compassion, and do everything so as to put a stop
to the mischief at this point. For even after what I have mentioned he did
not desist from his deeds of iniquity, but sought to renew the former
attack. For when the most devout Emperor had turned out those who
shamelessly rushed into the Church, and many of the Bishops present
seeing their iniquity had retreated into their own dioceses, flying from the
incursion of these men as from a fire devouring all things, we were again
invited to the city, and to the Church, from which we had been unjustly
expelled, more than thirty bishops introducing us, and our most pious
Emperor sending a notary for this purpose, while Theophilus immediately

took to flight. For what purpose, and from what cause? When we entered
the city we besought our most pious Emperor to convene a synod for
prosecuting the offenders in the late transactions. Being conscious
therefore of what he had done, and dreading conviction, the imperial letters
having been sent in every direction, convoking all men froth all quarters,
Theophilus secretly at midnight flung himself into a boat, and so made his
escape, taking all his company with him.

3. But even then we did not desist, supported as we were by a clear
conscience, from making the same supplication again to the most devout
Emperor: and he, acting as became his piety, sent to Theophilus again,
summoning him from Egypt, and his associates, in order to give an account
of the late proceedings, and informing him that he was not to suppose that
the one-sided deeds which he had so unjustly perpetrated in our absence,
and in violation of so many canons, would suffice for his defense. He did
not however submit to the royal mandate, but remained at home, alleging
an insurrection of the people in excuse, and the unseasonable zeal of
certain persons who were attached to him, as he pretended: and yet before
the arrival of the imperial letters this same people had deluged him with
abuse. But we do not make much of these matters now, but have said what
we have said as wishing to prove the fact that he was arrested in his
mischievous course. Yet even after these things we did not rest, but were
urgent in our demand that a tribunal should be formed for the purpose of
enquiry and defense: for we said that we were ready to prove that we
ourselves were guiltless, but that they had flagrantly transgressed. For
there were some Syrians amongst those present with him at that time, who
were left behind here; and we accosted them expressing our readiness to
plead our cause, and frequently importuned them on this behalf,
demanding that the minutes (of the late transactions) should be given up to
us, or that the formal bills of indictment, or the nature of the charges, or
the accusers themselves, should be made known; and yet we did not obtain
any of these things, but were again expelled from the Church. How am I to
relate the events which followed, transcending as they do every kind of
tragedy? What language will set forth these events? what kind of ear will
receive them without shuddering? For when we were urging these things,
as I said before, a dense troop of soldiers, on the great Sabbath itself, as
the day was hastening towards eventide, having broken into the Churches

violently drove out all the clergy who were with us, and surrounded the
sanctuary with arms. And women from the oratories who had stripped
themselves for baptism just at that time, fled unclothed, from terror at this
grievous assault, not being permitted to put on the modest apparel which
befits women; indeed many received wounds before they were expelled,
and the baptismal pools were filled with blood, and the sacred water
reddened by it. Nor did the distress cease even at this point; but the
soldiers, some of whom as we understand were unbaptized, having entered
the place where the sacred vessels were stored, saw all the things which
were inside it, and the most holy blood of Christ, is might happen in the
midst of such confusion, was spill upon the garments of the soldiers
aforesaid: and every kind of outrage was committed as in a barbarian siege.
And the common people were driven to the wilderness, and all the people
tarried outside the city, and the Churches became empty in the midst of
this great Festival, and more than forty bishops who associated with us
were vainly and causelessly expelled together with the people and clergy.
And there were shrieks and lamentations, and torrents of tears were shed
everywhere, in the market places, in the houses, in the desert places, and
every part of the city was filled with these calamities; for owing to the
immoderate extent of the outrage not only the sufferers, but also they who
did not undergo anything of the kind sympathized with us, not only those
who held the same opinions as ours. but also heretics, and Jews, and
Greeks, and all places were in a state of tumult and confusion, and
lamentation, as if the city had been captured by force. And these things
were perpetrated contrary to the intention of our most pious Emperor,
under cover of night, the Bishops contriving them, and in many places
conducting the attack, nor were they ashamed to have sergeants instead of
deacons marching in front of them. And when day dawned all the city was
migrating outside the walls under trees and groves, celebrating the festival,
like scattered sheep.

4. All which happened afterwards I leave you to imagine; for as I said
before it is not possible to describe each separate incident. The worst of it
is that these evils, great and serious as they are, have not even now been
suppressed nor is there any hope of their suppression; on the contrary the
mischief is extending itself every day, and we have become a laughing
stock to the multitude, or rather I should say, no one laughs even if he is

infinitely lawless, but all men mourn, as I was saying, this new kind of
lawlessness, the finishing stroke of all our ills.

What is one to say to the disorders in the other Churches? For the evil did
not stop even here, but made its way to the east. For as when some evil
humor is discharged from the head, all the other parts are corrupted, so
now also these evils, having originated in this great city as from a fountain,
confusion has spread in every direction, and clergy have everywhere made
insurrection against bishops, there has been schism between bishop and
bishop, people and people, and will be yet more; every place is suffering
from the throes of calamity, and the subversion of the whole civilized
world. Having been informed then of all these things, my lords, most
honorable and devout, exhibit the courage and zeal which becomes you, so
as to put a stop to this great assault of lawlessness which has been made
upon the Churches. For if this custom were to prevail, and it became
lawful for any persons who desired it to enter strange dioceses, so widely
separated, and expel those whom one wished to remove, and do whatever
they pleased according to their own arbitrary power, be assured that all
things will go to ruin, and an implacable kind of war will overrun the whole
world, all men attacking others, and being in turn attacked. Therefore to
prevent such confusion overtaking the whole earth yield to our entreaties
that ye will signify by writing that these lawless transactions executed in
our absence, and after hearing one side only, although we did not decline a
trial, are invalid, as indeed they are by the very nature of the case, and that
those who are convicted of having committed such iniquities must be
subjected to the penalty of the ecclesiastical laws; and for ourselves, who
have not been detected or convicted, or proved liable to punishment may
we continue to have the benefit of your correspondence, and your love,
and all other things which we have enjoyed aforetime. But if even now
those who have committed such lawless acts are willing to disclose the
charges on the strength of which they have unjustly expelled us, neither
memoranda, nor formal bills of indictment being given, nor the accusers
having appeared: yet if an impartial tribunal is formed, we will submit to
be tried, and will make our defense, and prove ourselves guiltless of the
things laid to our charge, as indeed we are: for the things which they have
done are outside the bounds of every kind of order and every kind of
ecclesiastical law and canon And why do I say ecclesiastical canon? Not

even in the heathen courts would such audacious deeds ever have been
committed, or rather not even in a barbarian court, neither Scythians, nor
Sarmatians would ever have judged a cause in this fashion, deciding it after
hearing one side only, in the absence of the accused, who only deprecated
enmity, not a trial of his case, who was ready to call any number of judges,
asserting himself to be innocent and able to clear himself of the charges in
the face of the world, and prove himself guiltless in every respect.

Having considered therefore all these things, and having been clearly
informed of all particulars by my lords, our most devout brethren the
bishops, may you be induced to exert your zeal on our behalf; for in so
doing ye will confer a favor not upon ourselves alone but also upon the
Church at large, and ye will receive your reward from God who does all
things for the peace of the Churches. Fare thee well always, and pray for
me, most honored and holy master.

TO INNOCENT, BISHOP OF ROME, GREETING IN THE LORD

OUR body it is true is settled in one place, but the pinion of love wings its
way round every part of the world. Even so we also although we be
separated by a journey of such great extent are nigh to your Piety, and in
daily communion with you, beholding with the eyes of love the courage of
your soul, the sterling nature of your disposition, your firmness and
inflexibility, the great consolation, constant and abiding, which you bestow
upon us. For in proportion as the billows mount higher, and concealed
reefs increase, and the hurricanes are many does your vigilance wax
stronger: and neither the great length of the journey between us, nor the
large amount of time consumed, nor the difficulty in dealing with events
has disposed you to become supine: but ye continue to imitate the best
class of pilots who are on the alert at those times most especially when
they see the waves crested, the sea swelling, the water dashing
vehemently, and the deepest darkness in day-time. Therefore also we feel
great gratitude towards you, and we long to send you showers of letters,
thus affording ourselves the greatest gratification. But since we are
deprived of this, owing to the desolation of the place; (for not only of
those who arrive from your regions, but even of those who dwell in our
part of the world no one could easily have intercourse with us, both on
account of the distance, the spot in which we are confined being situated at

the very extremity of the country, and also the terror of robbers acting as a
bar to the whole journey:) we beseech you rather to pity us because of our
long silence, than to condemn us for indolence on that account. For as a
proof that our silence has not been due to negligence, we have now at last
after a long time secured our most honored and beloved John the
presbyter, and Paul the deacon, and we send a letter through them, and
continue to express our gratitude to you, that you have surpassed even
affectionate parents in your good will and zeal concerning us. And indeed
so far as your Piety is concerned all. things would have been duly
amended, and the accumulation of evils and offenses have been swept
away, and the Churches would have enjoyed peace and a glassy calm, and
all things would have floated along with a smooth stream, and the despised
laws and violated decrees of the fathers would have been vindicated. But
since in reality none of these things has taken place, they who perpetrated
the former deeds striving to aggravate their former iniquities, I omit any
detailed narrative of their subsequent proceedings: for the narrative would
exceed the limits not merely of a letter but even of a history; only this I
beseech your vigilant soul, even if they who have filled everything with
confusion be impenitently and incurably corrupt, let not those who have
undertaken to cure them become faint-hearted or despondent, when they
consider the magnitude of the thing to be accomplished. For the contest
now before you has to be fought on behalf of nearly the whole world, on
behalf of Churches humbled to the ground, of people dispersed, of clergy
assaulted, of bishops sent into exile, of ancestral laws violated. Wherefore
we beseech your Diligence, once, twice, yea many times, in proportion as
the storm increases, to manifest still greater zeal. For we expect that
something more will be done for the purpose of amending these wrongs.
But even if this should not take place, ye at least have your crown made
ready for you by the merciful God, and the resistance offered by your love
will be no small consolation to those who are wronged: for now that we
are passing the third year of our sojourn in exile exposed to famine,
pestilence, wars, continual sieges, indescribable solitude, daily death, and
Isaurian swords, we are not a little encouraged and comforted by the
constant and abiding nature of your disposition and confidence, and by
reveling in your abundant and genuine love, This is our wall of defense,
this is our security, this our calm haven, this our treasure of infinite
blessings, this our gladness, and ground of much joy. And even if we

should be carried off again to some spot more desolate than this, we shall
carry this love away with us as no small consolation of our sufferings.

TO THE BELOVED BROTHER JOHN, INNOCENT

ALTHOUGH the innocent man ought to expect all good things, and to crave
mercy from God, nevertheless we also, counseling resignation, have sent
an appropriate letter by the hands of Cyriacus the deacon; so that
insolence may not have more power in oppressing, than a good conscience
has in retaining hope. For thou who art the teacher and pastor of so many
people needest not to be taught that the best men are ever frequently put
to the test whether they will persevere in the perfection of patience, and
not succumb to any toil of distress: and certainly conscience is a strong
defense against all things which unjustly befall us: and unless any one
conquer these by patient endurance he supplies an argument for evil
surmising. For he ought to endure all things who trusts first of all in God,
and then in his own conscience; seeing that the noble and good man can be
specially trained to endurance, inasmuch as the holy Scriptures guard his
mind; and the sacred lessons which we deliver to the people abound in
examples, testifying as they do that nearly all the saints have been
continually oppressed in divers ways, and are tested as by a kind of
scrutiny, and so attain to the crown of patience. Let conscience itself
console thy love, most honored brother, which in affliction supplies the
consolation of virtue. For under the eye of the Master Christ, the
conscience, having been purged, will find rest in the haven of peace.

INNOCENT, BISHOP, TO PRESBYTERS AND DEACONS,
 AND TO ALL THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE OF THE CHURCH OF
CONSTANTINOPLE, THE BRETHREN BELOVED WHO ARE
SUBJECT TO THE BISHOP JOHN, GREETING

FROM the letters of your love which ye have sent by the hands of
Germanus the presbyter, and Casianus the deacon, I have studied with
anxious care the scene of calamity which ye have placed before my eyes,
and by repeated perusal of your description I thoroughly perceived under
what great distress and toil your faith is laboring: and this is a matter
which can be cured only by the consolation of patience: for our God will
speedily grant an end to such great afflictions, and He will aid you in your

endurance of these things. Moreover whilst praising the statement of your
case which contains many testimonies encouraging to patience I notice this
necessary consolation placed at the beginning of the epistle of your love:
for the consolation which we ought to have written to you, ye have
anticipated by your letter. For this is the kind of patience which our
Master is wont to supply to those who are in distress, in order that the
servants of Christ when they are in affliction may console themselves by
reflecting that the things which they themselves are suffering have
happened to the saints also in former times. And we also from your letter
shall be able to derive consolation: for we are not estranged from
sympathy with you, inasmuch as we also are chastised in your persons.
For who will be able to endure the offenses committed by those men who
ought to be specially zealous promoters of the tranquillity of the Church
and of concord itself. At the present time, by a perversion of custom,
guiltless priests are expelled from the presidency of their own Churches.
And this is what your chief brother, and fellow minister, John, your
bishop has unjustly suffered, not having obtained any hearing: no crime is
charged against him, none is heard. And what is the object of this
iniquitous device? that no pretext for a trial may occur, or be sought, other
men are introduced into the places of living priests, as if those who start
from an offense of this description could be judged by any one to have
anything good or to have done anything right. For we understand that such
deeds have never been perpetrated by our fathers or rather that they were
prevented by the fact that no one had authority given him to ordain
another to take the place of one who was still living. For a spurious
ordination cannot deprive the priest of his rank: seeing that neither can he
be a bishop who is wrongfully substituted for another. And as regards the
observance of the canons we lay it down that we ought to follow those,
which were defined at Nicaea, to which alone the Catholic Church is bound
to pay obedience and recognition. And if others are brought forward by
certain men, which are at variance with the canons framed at Nicaea, and
are proved to have been composed by heretics, let them be rejected by the
Catholic bishops. For the inventions of heretics ought not to be appended
to the Catholic canons; for by their adverse and unlawful decrees they are
always intending to weaken the design of the canons of Nicaea. Not only
therefore do we say that these ought not to be followed, but rather that
they should be condemned amongst heretical and schismatic decrees, as

was formerly done in the Council of Sardica by the bishops who were
before us. For it were more fitting, most honored brethren, that good deeds
should be condemned than that things done in direct opposition to the
canons should have any validity. But what are we to do against such
things at the present time? A synodical decision of them is necessary, and
we have long declared that a synod ought to be convened, as it is the only
means of allaying the agitation of such tempests as these: and if we obtain
this it is expedient that the healing of these evils should be committed to
the will of the great God, and His Christ our Lord. All the disturbances
then which have been caused by the envy of the devil for the probation of
the faithful will be mitigated; through the firmness of our faith we ought
not to despair of anything from the Lord. For we ourselves also are
considering much by what means the ecumenical synod may be brought
together in order that by the will of God these disturbing movements may
be brought to an end. Let us therefore endure for a while, and fortified by
the wall of patience let us hope that all things may be restored to us by the
assistance of our God. Moreover all things which ye say ye have
undergone we have learned by accurate enquiry from our fellow bishops
who have already taken refuge in Rome, although for the most part at
different times, that is to say, Demetrius, Cyriacus, Eulysius and
Palladius, who are here with us.

ST. CHRYSOTOM:

THE HOMILIES ON THE
STATUES

TO THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOCH

TRANSLATED BY

REV. W. R. W. STEPHENS, M.A.,

Prebendary Of Chichester Cathedral,
And Rector Of Woolbeding, Sussex.

PREFACE TO THE BENEDICTINE EDITION

1. AMONG the events which occurred in the time of John Chrysostom,
there is none more memorable than that seldom of the inhabitants of
Antioch, in which the Statues of the Emperor Theodosius and Flacilla his
wife were thrown down and dragged about the city, at which Theodosius
was so exasperated, as even to think of destroying the city entirely. This
afforded ample matter for our Chrysostom to exercise his powers of
preaching. For as the people of Antioch were fluctuating between hope
and fear (sudden accidents offering of course daily some fresh cause for
hope or alarm) Chrysostom, compelled as he was to adapt his style to
circumstances as they arose, almost always without preparation, delivered
on the spur of the occasion these Homilies, which are certainly well
deserving of admiration. At one time his object here is to console a people
struggling with present distress; at another, to strengthen minds that were
sinking under the extremity of danger; and above all, by repeated
admonition, to persuade the people of Antioch, on occasion of the
threatened calamities, to correct the vices and to wipe away the crimes
that had thus provoked God's wrath; which endeavor on the part of
Chrysostom certainly ended in results agreeable to his desire, as he
sometimes acknowledges.

2. But the cause of this great sedition was, according to the testimony of
Zosimus, excess of taxation, which was daily inventing new imposts; an
exaction required either for the celebration of the fifth year upon which
Arcadius had entered, from the time he was proclaimed under the title of
Augustus, and the tenth year of the Emperor Theodosius, commencing in
the year 388, or for the expenses of the war against the tyrant Maximus,
or on account of both these events, as well as for other necessities of the
state. The people of Antioch, that is to say, the superior class of the
citizens, dismayed at the burden of this impost, first approached the
prefect, and with tears lamented the excess of the tax that had been
announced, and implored the Divine assistance. And next, a multitude of
vagabonds and foreigners of the lowest class of the people, in a state of
excited feeling, broke out into deeds of violence. At first they turned
everything upside down in the public baths; hence they proceeded to the

prefect's palace, and attacked the doors and windows, and were scarcely
repelled, when they turned their rage in another direction, and attacked the
painted tablets of the Emperors with stones, covered them with filth, and
reduced them to a ruinous condition, while they loaded the Augusti
themselves with curses and reproaches. At length they threw down the
Statues of the Emperor Theodosius and Flacilla his deceased wife, and
dragged them throughout the streets of the city; and had already
commenced further outrages, when they were put down by a band of
archers, dispatched from the prefect. The sedition being thus extinguished,
fear took the place of madness, and the expectation of impending
punishment caused the burdensome tax that had been imposed to be
entirely forgotten. What followed afterwards will be narrated below in the
review of the Homilies. Something must now be said as to the year of the
sedition, in which these Homilies were delivered.

3. Dismissing the narrative of Sozomen and Theodoret, according to whose
account, this sedition, and the delivery of these discourses, must have been
after the war against Maximus, learned men, and Tillemont especially (at
length in note 27 appended to his Life of the Emperor Theodosius) have
proved from far more certain notes of time, that these events took place
before the war against Maximus. In opposition to that former opinion, he
produces a most convincing argument from Chrysostom's own words,
who in the sixteenth Homily (No. 2), testifies that this was the second
year since he had begun to preach; but he began when he was first ordained
presbyter at the end of the year 385, or at the beginning of 386. Wherefore
these discourses ought to be attributed either to the year 388, rather 387.
For the former opinion Baronius contends, and after him, Petanius and
Henry Valesius, who assigns them to the year 388, for this reason, that the
tenth year of the reign of Theodosius then commenced, for the celebration
of which the tax before mentioned was imposed. But what is adduced from
Libanius for the defense of this opinion is full of perplexity, and is capable
of being twisted to support either opinion. A still more certain indication
than any of these is gathered from the circumstance, that the Emperor
Theodosius was certainly at Constantinople during the winter and Lent of
the year 387, in which year also the sedition must necessarily have
occurred; for at the time of the sedition he was most certainly staying at
Constantinople, but on the other hand at the same season in the year

immediately following, he was living at Thessalonica. But what is alleged
to the contrary from the celebration of the tenth year of Theodosius,
which commenced in the year 388, amounts, as I said, to nothing; since it
is evident from the Fasti of Idatius and of Marcellinus, that he anticipated
by one year the celebration of the tenth year of his reign, in order that he
might celebrate his tenth together with his son Arcadius, who entered
upon the fifth year of his reign in 387; just in the same manner as
Maximianus Herculius did, when he celebrated the twentieth, though it
was only the eighteenth, year of his reign, along with Diocletian, whose
twentieth year of empire it was.

4. But another and not a less difficulty arises, which has been already
treated of in the Preface to the work, "Against the Jews;" viz. that in a
certain discourse against the Jews, held in the month of September of the
year 386, Chrysostom in reproving many of the Christian in Antioch who
fasted and kept Easter with the Jews, or at the time observed by the Jews,
"Behold," saith he, "the first day of unleavened bread in this year falls on
Sunday, and it is necessary that we should fast throughout the whole
week, and after the Passion is past, and the Cross and the Resurrection
arrived, we should continue fasting; and very often the same thing occurs,
that after the Passion has passed away, and the Cross and the
Resurrection arrived, we are still keeping the fast, the week being not yet
finished." From these words it is further evident, that those Christians,
who acted as Jews in keeping the fast, and celebrating the Passover, must
sometimes have fasted when other Christians were celebrating the Paschal
Feast, and at other times not so; for example, they fasted on the day of the
Resurrection when the Jews celebrated the feast of the Passover later than
the rest of the Christians did, but they did not fast when the Jews
celebrated the same feast earlier than the Christians. But in the discourse
of Chrysostom above mentioned, and held about the month of September
of the year 386, he is doubtless treating of Lent and Easter of the year 387.
But in that year, according to the Pachal tables, the feast fell on the 25th of
April, that is to say, as late as it can possibly occur. How then could these
judaizing Christians be fasting this year during the Paschal feast, and
celebrate that feast too late, when this could not occur later than on the
25th of April, on which day the other non-judaizing Christians celebrated
it this year, at least if the Pachal tables are to be relied upon? This is

certainly a very great difficulty; but one which, as Tillemont himself
confesses, is not sufficient to overturn the marks of the period by which
we assign the Homily, "Against the Jews," to the month of September, in
the year 386. For as we have said in the Preface to the Homilies against the
Jews, it has not yet been made out to us so certainly, whether the people
of Antioch always followed by an invariable rule the Alexandrian
reckoning as to the Feast of the Lord's Passover, and if they had always
followed it, can we affirm that they never fell into error in their reckoning?
Certainly the persons best skilled in the Paschal reckonings, whom I have
consulted, have admitted that an error of this sort sometimes does happen
in such reckonings, and did not happen many years since; and that it is not
always safe to prefer the Pachal indications to any other notes of time.

5. Tillemont, however, who notices this kind of difficulty, and discusses it
in his notes to the Life of Chrysostom, where he treats of the Homilies
against the Jews, has not mentioned it in the notes to the Life of the
Emperor Theodosius, where he arranges these Homilies of Chrysostom to
the people of Antioch as if the Feast of Easter had fallen on the 25th of
April, as the Paschal tables have it. The first Homily therefore he places a
little before the sedition; but the sedition on the 26th of February, ten
days before Lent, which at Antioch began on the Monday of our
Quinquagesima, falling that year on the 8th of March. The second Homily
either on the Thursday, or the Saturday before Lent; viz. on the 6th of
March, the eighth day after the sedition. The third on the following
Sunday, the 7th of March, or thereabout. The fourth, on the Monday
following, March 8. The fifth, on Tuesday, March 9. The sixth, about the
next Wednesday, on March 10. The seventh, on Thursday, March 11th.
The eighth, on Friday, March 12. The ninth on the Monday of the second
week in Lent, March 15. The tenth, after the lapse of a few days. The
eleventh, (considering it transposed,) on the Monday of the fourth week in
Lent, March 29. The twelfth, on the following Tuesday, March 30. The
thirteenth, on the following Wednesday, March 31. The fourteenth, a little
after that one which is numbered the eighteenth, which was delivered on
the fifth Sunday in Lent, April 5. The fifteenth, on the Saturday of the
second week in Lent, or March 20. The sixteenth, on the third Saturday in
Lent, March 21. The seventeenth, about the end of the fourth week in
Lent. The eighteenth, Sunday, April 5, or thereabout. The nineteenth, after

the fourteenth, about April 11. The twentieth, on Easter Day, April 25.
The twenty-first, about the same time as the twenty-second following it,
which was delivered on the Friday after Passion Sunday, April 16. Thus
does Tillemont endeavor to restore with the utmost accuracy the deranged
order of these Homilies. Whilst however we agree with him in many
things, we are compelled to differ from him in others. The order of the
Homilies, as he lays it down, we may her further represent in one tabular
view.

Tillemont's 1st is placed in Edition of Fronto Ducaeus - First

2nd - Second

3rd - Third

4th - Fourth

5th. - Fifth

6th. - Sixth

7th. - Seventh

8th. - Eighth

9th. - Ninth

10th - Tenth

11th - Fifteenth

12th - Sixteenth

13th - Eleventh

14th - Twelfth

15th - Thirteenth

16th. - Seventeenth

17th. - Eighteenth

18th. - Fourteenth

19th. - Nineteenth

20th - Twenty-second

21st. - Twenty-first

22d - Twentieth

But before we discourse singly of the Homilies, and make a few
observation as to the order as well as the argument of each, it may be
worth while to remark, that from the title of the Homily which formerly
was numbered the twenty-second, but now the twentieth, which title it
has in the notes of Fronton, and in our Mss.; it must have been spoken ten
days before Easter; and that from these words likewise, just before the end
of the Homily, "Forty days have already passed away," Tillemont justly
infers, that Lent among the people of Antioch began on the Monday after
Quinquagesima; and that among them the whole Lent extended through
seven weeks; and he rightly assigns this Homily to a Friday during Lent;
so that that day was both the fortieth from the beginning of the fast, and
the tenth before Easter. Hence we hold it as a thing established, that Lent,
which in divers Churches was defined by various limits, was observed at
Antioch during seven weeks.

Moreover, since for the causes before related, we may account the diurnal
Paschal tables, which place the Easter of the year 387 upon the 25th of
April, as of doubtful authority, at least those for the use of the Church at
Antioch; we have not discovered with certainty on what day the people of
Antioch kept Easter in this year 387, we shall abstain from mentioning the
day of the month in the review of the Homilies, and we shall account it
sufficient to have spoken.

The first Homily, then, was delivered a few days before the sedition at
Antioch, as is discoverable from these words in No. (3.) of the second
Homily; "I lately protracted a long discourse to your charity . . . . and I
have a reward for my labors. But what was the reward? To punish the
blasphemers in the city, and to chastise those who reference to the first
Homily, one of great length, on the subject of the sorrows of the Saints,
and the providence of God towards His Elect, who are tormented in this
life, where at last he thus expresses himself in a manner certainly worthy
of observation. "But since our discourse has now turned to the subject of
blasphemy, I desire to ask one favor of you all in return for this address

and speaking with you, which is, that you will correct on my behalf those
who blaspheme in this city. And should you hear any one in the public
thoroughfare, or in the midst of the forum, blaspheming God; go up to
him, rebuke him; and should it be necessary to inflict blows, spare not to
do so. Smite him on the face; strike his mouth; sanctify thy hand with the
blow." Which truly would be a mode of correction not suited to modern
usage.

The second Homily, Tillemont refers either to the Thursday or to the
Saturday before Lent; but it may more safely be pronounced to have been
spoken "about" that time, seven days having been completed as
Chrysostom himself says, since the sedition, during which he declares that
he had been silent, because the people of Antioch, being in consternation
from the mighty calamity and from the immensity of the danger, were in
no fit state for the hearing of Sermons; moreover, that this evil was one
sent from God, on account of their having neglected the correction of their
blaspheming brethren; and after he has drawn a beautiful picture of their
state, he concludes the discourse, after having preached at length on riches,
the use of riches, alms-giving, and poverty.

The third Homily follows close on the second. But we suppose with
Tillemont, that it was delivered on Quinquagesima Sunday (to speak
according to modern custom). Chrysostom treats here of the departure of
Flavian the Bishop of Antioch to Constantinople for the purpose of
appeasing the Emperor, and consoles the people with the hope of his
succeeding. He then proves at length that there is no utility in fasting,
unless there be an abstinence from vices. But after making a few remarks
on avoiding slander, he deplores the present calamity, and relates some
harsh severities. "Some," saith he, "have perished by the sword, some by
fire; some given to wild beasts; and not men only but children. And neither
this immaturity of age, nor the tumult of the people, nor the circumstance
that they were infuriated by demons when they perpetrated such deeds,
nor that the exaction was thought to be intolerable, nor poverty, nor
having offended in company with all, nor promising that they would never
hereafter dare to repeat such deeds, nor any thing else could at all rescue
them; but they were led away to the pit without reprieve, armed soldiers
conducting and guarding them on either side, lest any one should carry off
the criminals; whilst mothers also followed afar off, seeing their children

beheaded, but not daring to bewail their calamity; for terror conquered
grief, and fear overcame nature."

All these evils were inflicted on the people of Antioch by the Prefects or
Magistrates before Theodosius had heard any thing of the sedition, as
Chrysostom says in the same place. But he concludes the address by
admonishing that they should abstain from slander, from enmities, and
from oaths.

The fourth Homily, delivered as it seems on the Monday, which was the
beginning of Lent, describes the advantages gained from the calamity. He
speaks of the people of Antioch as changed and brought back from their
former habits. But at the close he again repeats the same admonition,
which he reminds them that he had given in the foregoing Homily, that is
to say, concerning slanders, enmities, and oaths. But in No. (6.), he says,
that he should speak throughout this week concerning oaths.

The fifth Homily was pronounced on the day following, that is, on the
Tuesday, as Chrysostom says at the beginning of it. In this Chrysostom
consoles the people of Antioch as usual, under their sadness, and exhorts
them to a contempt for death. In the end also he treats No. (7.) of the
avoidance of oaths, and indicates somewhat of the order of the foregoing
and following Homilies in these words. "Let us therefore persuade it (our
soul) to make this first change for the better by the avoidance of oaths; for
although I spake to you yesterday and the day before on this same
subject, yet neither today, nor tomorrow, nor the day after, will I desist
from giving my counsel on this subject."

In the sixth Homily, delivered on the Wednesday of the first week, he
imparts consolation to the afflicted, and urges them to hope for a
prosperous turn of affairs. He speaks of the delays the messengers had
met with, who were gone to announce to the Emperor the sedition at
Antioch, as proceeding from God; and from thence deduces a favorable
hope for his hearers, and bids them feel confidence of obtaining pardon by
the petition of Flavian the Bishop; and after he had discoursed on the
subject of not being afraid of death, he again speaks as usual against oaths.

The seventh Homily was delivered, as is evident from many indications,
on the day following. "It is the fifth day," says Chrysostom, "we are

engaged in speaking words of comfort to your charity." But this fifth day
is reckoned by beginning from the Sunday, so that he must be speaking of
the fifth day of the week. He here treats of the first words of Genesis, "In
the beginning God made heaven and earth;" and he observes, that God is
not only good when He chastises, but also when He confers favors; and
concludes by exhorting to avoid oaths.

The eighth Homily Tillemont supposes to have been spoken on the day
following the seventh Homily, that is, on the Friday. But Chrysostom
disclaims it, who testifies at the outset that he discoursed on the passage,
"In the beginning God made heaven and earth, lately" (Prw>
yesterday (cqe<v), which without doubt belongs to the seventh Homily.
Therefore the present Homily is to be assigned to the Saturday; which
these words just immediately after the beginning would also incline us to
think. "The week hath nearly arrived at its close with us." The argument
of the Homily he draws from these words, "God was walking in Paradise
in the cool of the day." On this he observes the wicked are always timid
and fearful, but the godly full of confidence. Finally, he treats according to
his custom of the avoiding of oaths, and says, that it is now the sixth day
since he had been admonishing as to the observance of this law.

|hn) not

The ninth Homily Tillemont with probability allots to the Monday of the
second week in Lent. But as to this matter no indication presents itself by
which we may lay down any thing certain or probable. This discourse
was, however, delivered after a silence of one or more days, as
Chrysostom expressly states at the beginning; contrary to which is the
opinion of Tillemont, who, whilst he allots the eighth Homily to the
Friday of one week, and the ninth to the Monday of the week following,
says in the Life of Chrysostom, Art. (15.), that the intervening Sabbaths
and Lord's days were doubtless distinguished by discourses of
Chrysostom, which discourses have been lost. Chrysostom, at the
commencement of this, praises the people of Antioch, that yielding to his
admonitions they were taking pains to expel the practice of oaths. On
these words also, "The heavens declare the glory of God," he speaks at
length, and sets forth God's providence in the order and harmony of the
natural world, and at length he concludes the address by admonishing that
oaths should be abstained from.

The tenth Homily was not delivered on the day following the ninth,
although it follows up the same argument, as is shewn by the word,
Prw>
|hn "lately." But Chrysostom here congratulates his auditors that they
had yielded to his admonitions. He declares it is far better to hear the word
of God than to fast. He then proves that the world could not possibly
subsist without a divine Providence, and he ends, at length, by an
exhortation to abstain from oaths.

The eleventh Homily, Tillemont supposes to have been delivered after
that which here has the inscription of the fifteenth, as well as after the
sixteenth which follows it. The argument he employs is this; In this
Homily he says, the subject is concerning certain dangers and distresses
which the city of Antioch had already passed through, which events seem
to have taken place after the arrival of Hellebichus and Caesarius. But that
arrival of Hellebichus and Caesarius is mentioned in the Title of the
seventeenth Homily, long after the eleventh of which we are now treating.

Supported by this argument, Tillemont thinks that not only the fifteenth,
but also the sixteenth ought to be placed before the eleventh. But besides
that all the Manuscripts, without exception, preserve the very same order
as the published Editions, we have not a sufficiently accurate knowledge
of all the events, the dangers, terrors, and threats of the time, that for a
reason of this sort we should deem there ought to be any change in the
order. Chrysostom has spoken of many things, but was perhaps silent on
many more. Wherefore, until something more certain be brought to light,
we think the ancient order must be adhered to. In this Homily Chrysostom
at the beginning gives thanks, because the city breathed again after the
terror that had fallen on it, since multitudes had taken flight in consequence
of suspicions that had been thrown out among them. For some days
Chrysostom was silent (as he himself says) during this season of calamity
and terror. But Tillemont assigns this Homily to the Monday of the fourth
week in Lent, and indeed with the best reason, as we shall shew when we
come to the thirteenth Homily. In the present Homily he treats principally
of the wisdom of God in the constitution of man, and at the end
concerning the avoiding of oaths.

The twelfth, as well as the thirteenth, for the same reason as above,
Tillemont makes later than the fifteenth and sixteenth. But I know not in

what way he understands that passage in this twelfth Homily, No. (2.)
"On the three foregoing days, then, we have investigated one method of
acquiring the knowledge of God, and have brought it to a conclusion,
explaining how ‘the' visible ‘heavens declare the glory of God,' and what
is the meaning of that which is said by Paul; ‘The invisible things of Him
from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made;' and we have shewed how from the creation of the
world, and how by heaven, and earth, and sea, the Creator is glorified. But
today," etc. Here Chrysostom clearly refers to a series of these Homilies
in the order in which they were delivered before the twelfth, that is to say,
the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh. In the ninth (No. 2.) he places as the
argument of his discourse the saying of Paul, "The invisible things of
Him," etc. as well as that of the Psalms, "The heavens declare the glory of
God." In the tenth (No. 2.) likewise he declares that he is pursuing this
very argument. In the eleventh (No. 2.) also he testifies that he is insisting
on the same argument. Is not Tillemont doing violence to the words of
Chrysostom, when he wishes the tenth and the eleventh to be inserted
between the fifteenth and sixteenth? This, however, he only proposes, half
doubtingly, in note on the Emperor Theodosius, No. 10, 11 seq. and he
confesses, that the order which we have laid down is clearly indicated by
Chrysostom; but for what reason I know not, he afterwards departs from
the same order. But when Chrysostom says, "on the three past days," it is
not to be understood of three successive days, but of the three last days
on which he had preached. In this twelfth Homily, likewise, which was
delivered on the Tuesday of the fourth week, he dwells on the same
subject of the wisdom of God in the creation of the world. He afterwards
treats of the natural law, the knowledge of which God hath implanted in
man, and on the avoidance of oaths.

The thirteenth Homily was spoken the day after the twelfth. At the
commencement he returns thanks to God that the face of affairs was
changed, and the fear removed, which had been such that "the greater part
of the city," as he says, "had taken refuge from the fear and danger of that
occasion in secret places, in deserts, and hollows." Hence he proceeds to
speak of many who were dragged to the tribunal; of the horrible inquisition
that took place by means of the scourge; of others who were hurried away
to punishment; of a mother and sister of a certain person, who, whilst he

was undergoing his trial within, were rolling in the dust at the vestibule.
Chrysostom describes pathetically these events which had been transacted
a few days before, that is to say, before he delivered the eleventh
discourse. But the words which Chrysostom uses in the beginning, oi[an
th<n Parelqou~san ei]domen tetra>da cai< oi[an th<n Parou~san
oJrw~men nu~n, Bernard Brixianus thus renders, "Quale praeteritum vidimus
quatriduum et quale nunc videmus praesens:" I know not for what reason
we have left this untouched. For although tetra<v is sometimes taken to
signify the fourth day, yet in ecclesiastical language, even from the time of
Clemens Alexandrinus, tetra<v is the fourth day of the week, so that the
Translation should be corrected, and should stand, "Qualem feriam
quartam praeteritam vidimus," etc. In which it is declared, that the Homily
was delivered on the fourth day of the week, and that indeed the fourth
week in Lent, or perhaps the third, according to another mode of
reckoning; since for many ages downwards the Greeks call that the first
Sunday and week of the fast which we call the first of Lent. But this is
only a question as to a name. The Homily was however delivered on the
fourth day of the week, and from the series of the Homilies, as well as
from the silence of Chrysostom, there seems plainly to be an interval of
some days between the tenth and eleventh Homilies. In this Homily,
moreover, after much premised on that calamity of Antioch, he comes
down to the former argument concerning man's creation, and concludes his
discourse by an exhortation after his manner on avoiding oaths.

The fourteenth Tillemont thinks ought to be placed after the eighteenth;
influenced by this reason, that Chrysostom says at the beginning, "Not a
little did the devil yesterday disturb our city, but God hath also not a little
comforted us again." These words, he observes, denote that the arrival of
Hellebichus, and of news from Constantinople, had already occurred. But
these are mere conjectures spoken at random. How many suspicions and
terrors think you were cast abroad among the people of Antioch, whilst
they hung in doubt, and were ignorant to what result so unhappy an affair
might lead? But how can we possibly argue respecting these terrors and
reports, when we are doubtless ignorant of the greater part of them, and
have so obscure a perception of what we do know, that we can scarcely
gather from thence any indication of the time? This Homily is almost
wholly on the subject of avoiding oaths.

The fifteenth Homily, Tillemont would have it, was delivered between the
tenth and eleventh, both for the reasons above mentioned, and because
Chrysostom has these words at the commencement, ]Edei cai< th>meron
cai< tw|
~ prote>rw| sabba>tw| to<n peri< nhstei>av cinh~sai lo>gon. "It had
been right both today and on the former Sabbath, to let the discourse turn
on the subject of fasting." Where he understands the expression, tw|
prote>rw|, as though it were tw~
entertaining however some doubts on the point. But we, as well as
Bernard Brixianus, understand it of the earlier or preceding one. And we
have already proved in a former paragraph, that no other Homily can be
placed between the tenth and the eleventh. On the occasion of the dread
with which the people of Antioch were affected, he enlarges on the
advantage of fear, and at the end he preaches against the custom of
swearing, and of requiring an oath from others.

| prw>tw|, - the first Saturday in Lent,

The sixteenth Homily was delivered when all were deliberating upon
making their escape from the city, in consequence of a certain report, that
a sack was to take place. Tillemont endeavors also to change the position
of this Homily, and to place it between the tenth and eleventh, which,
however, as we have said in our remarks upon the twelfth, it cannot admit
of. Tillemont further supports his argument by these words: in No. 6, the
holy Doctor says, "We have passed through the second week of the fast."
He infers, therefore, that two weeks only of the fast had passed away, and
Tillemont on that ground determines, that it ought to be moved out of its
place. He supposes it was spoken on the third Sunday in Lent, reckoning
for the first Sunday that which preceded the first day of the fast, which
we call Quinquagesima Sunday. But what if at Antioch at that time, that
was called the first Sunday of Lent, which according to modern custom
occurs as the first within the fast? For the fast did begin the Monday after
Quinquagesima, and now it begins on the Wednesday, and the people of
Antioch might not reckon that week for the first week of Lent, just as we
do not reckon it as so, and in that way this Homily would have been
delivered one week later, that is to say, taking the Sunday after the modern
custom. But even then a great difficulty would remain, for this Homily
would precede the thirteenth and following ones. Certainly all these points
are full of perplexity, as Tillemont himself confesses, who is compelled to
leave the question, without entirely coming to any conclusion upon it.

~

Perhaps familiarity, and longer handling, will add to our knowledge on so
obscure a subject, which it is possible we may be able to determine, in
drawing up the life of Chrysostom at the end of his works, more clearly
and accurately. For which reason we have purposely determined to leave
the matter doubtful. That one point only we contend for, that this Homily
cannot be placed between the tenth and eleventh, for the reasons above
mentioned. Certain things being premised as to the timidity of the people
of Antioch, and the avoiding of oaths, Chrysostom borrows the argument
of the Homily from those words of Paul, "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ,
and Timothy our brother;" and shews that Paul was more glorious from
bonds, than from the power of miracles.

The seventeenth was delivered after Ellebichus, or Hellebichus, (styled
Magister Milltum), and Caesarius, (styled Magister), the persons sent by
the Emperor for the purpose of instituting an inquiry into the sedition, had
arrived at Antioch. This Hellebichus, Master of the Horse or Foot, is
found mentioned elsewhere, and was distinguished by a reputation for
justice and clemency. Caesarius, also styled elsewhere Master of the
Offices, enjoyed a similar reputation for high character. But this Homily
was pronounced when the people of Antioch were almost free from fear.
"We expected," says Chrysostom (No. 1.), "innumerable horrors, that the
property of all was to be plundered; the habitations consumed, together
with their inmates; the city snatched away from the midst of the world;
and all its relics obliterated, and its soil ploughed up: but, lo! all these
things stood only in expectance, and came not actually to pass." Next he
relates how the monks descended from the mountains to Antioch, that
they might appease the judges, while at the same time all the Greek
philosophers deserted the city; and in what way also the priests
strenuously exerted themselves on behalf of the people. He declares the
penalties imposed by the Emperor to be light and easy, and no matter of
grief or complaint, though the orchestra and public bath were closed, and
the dignity of a metropolis taken away from the city of Antioch. The true
dignity of Antioch was, that the disciples of Christ were first called
Christians there; that the people of Antioch had brought assistance to the
saints at Jerusalem, When struggling with famine; that not magnitude, but
piety, is the ornament of cities. Finally, however, he says that some were
yet remaining in prison; and that others were sent into exile. This Homily

Tillemont assigns to the fourth week of Lent, after Wednesday, but only
from conjecture.

The eighteenth Homily was spoken after half the fast was over, as
Chrysostom himself says at the beginning. But Tillemont thinks it may
probably be assigned to the fifth Sunday of Lent. He treats moreover of
the true reason for fasting; of contempt for riches; of godly sorrow, etc.

~ kuriakh|

~ th~v
The nineteenth Homily was delivered as the title has it, th|
ejpiswzome>nhv, or as Fronto Ducaeus reads it, th~v swzome>nmv. Among
the Cappadocians, ejpiswzome>nh is Ascension Day, as Allatius says in
his book on the Sundays and Weeks of the Greeks, adding that the Sunday
thus called is the fifth after Easter, i.e. the one which precedes the
Ascension of our Lord. But Savile says that it is the first Sunday after
Easter; from whence he got his information I know not. Yet there seems no
doubt that it was some one of the last Sundays in Lent, or, as Tillemont
supposes, Passion-Sunday, to which I rather incline. Chrysostom, who
had been, detained at home for some time by sickness, after he has
prefaced his subject with some remarks on the Festival of the Martyrs,
which had been just celebrated at Antioch, and on the arrival of the rustics,
speaks according to his custom against oaths, and illustrates their
pernicious effects by many examples.

Hitherto, in the number and order of the Homilies, we have followed the
editions of Savile and Fronto Ducaeus. But henceforth it is otherwise; for
that which follows as the twentieth in former editions, is without doubt
the twenty-first and last on the Statues. But the twenty-first is a
Catechesis, which we have placed second after another Catechesis, which
was inscribed as the first, as we remark in the Notice placed at the end of
the Homilies on the Statues, and in front of the Catechetical Lectures;
since this Catechesis ought to be placed entirely without the series of the
Homilies on the Statues. But the Homily, which is in former editions the
twenty-second, is without doubt the twentieth, which was delivered ten
days before Easter. Therefore we proceed in this order.

The twentieth Homily has these words in the title, according to
manuscripts mentioned by Fronto Ducaeus, and likewise in some of ours,
and particularly that in the Royal Library, numbered 1971. Ele>cqh de<
pro< de>ka hJmerw~n th~v aJgi>av kai< zwopoiou~ tou~ Kuri>ou hJmw~n jIhsou~

Cristou~ ejk nekrw~n ajnasta>sewv. "It was spoken ten days before the
holy and life-giving Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead."
This therefore is in perfect accordance with that saying of Chrysostom, a
little before the end of the Homily, "Forty days have passed away." This
sermon then was delivered on the Friday after the Sunday which we call
Passion-Sunday. For this day was the fortieth, beginning from the
Monday after Quinquagesima, which was the commencement of Lent. But
it was likewise the tenth before Easter, reckoning Easter itself with it. The
Homily is almost throughout against enmity and the remembrances of
injuries, and at the close is, according to Chrysostom's accustomed
manner, directed against oaths.

The twenty-first Homily, which is the last on the Statues, seems, from
what he says just at the beginning, to have been delivered on the very day
of the Lord's Resurrection, and after the return of Flavian the Bishop;
whose journey to the Emperor, and address to the same on behalf of the
city's preservation, as well as the Emperor's reply full of lenity in which
he pardons the citizens, are all particularly related by Chrysostom,
occupying the whole of this discourse. But even until the return of
Flavian, the people of Antioch were terrified by every day's reports, and
fluctuated between hope and fear, as Chrysostom observes a little after the
beginning.

CONTENTS OF THE HOMILIES

HOMILY 1

This Homily was delivered in the Old Church of Antioch, while St.
Chrysostom was yet a Presbyter, upon that saying of the Apostle, 1
Timothy 5:23: "Drink a little win for thy stomach's sake, and thy
often infirmities".

HOMILY 2

Spoken in Antioch in the Old Church, as it was called, while he was
a presbyter, on the subject of the calamity that had befallen the city
in consequence of the tumult connected with the overthrow of the
Statues of the Emperor Theodosius, the Great and Pious. And on
the saying of the Apostle, "Charge them that are rich that they be
not high-minded," 1 Timothy 6:17. And against covetousness.

HOMILY 3

On the departure of Flavian, Bishop of Antioch, who was gone on
an embassy to the Emperor Theodosius, on behalf of the city. Of the
dignity of the Priesthood. What is true fasting. Slander worse than
devouring the human body. And finally of those who had been put
to death on account of the sedition; and against those who
complained that many innocent persons were apprehended.

HOMILY 4

An exhortation to the people respecting fortitude and patience, from
the examples of Job and the Three Children in Babylon. The Homily
concludes with an address on the subject of abstaining from oaths.

HOMILY 5

The exhortation of the last Homily is continued in this. The people
are exhorted to bear with fortitude the impending wrath of the
Emperor. The cases of Job and the Ninevites are referred to as
examples. It is shewn that men ought not to fear death, but sin.
What it is to die miserable is explained; and the Homily concludes
with an earnest dissuasive against the use of oaths.

HOMILY 6

This Homily is intended to shew that the fear of Magistrates is
beneficial. It also contains an account of what occurred, during
their journey, to those who were conveying the tidings of the
Sedition to the Emperor. The case of Jonah is further cited in
illustration. The exhortation on the fear of death is here continued;
and it is shewn, that he who suffers unjustly, and yet gives thanks to
God, by whose permission it happens, is as one suffering for God's
sake. Examples are again adduced from the history of the Three
Children, and the Babylonian furnace. The Homily concludes with
an address on the necessity of abstaining from oaths.

HOMILY 7

Recapitulation of former exhortations. Sin brought death and grief
into the world, and they tend to its cure. Grief serviceable only for
the destruction of sin. Remarks upon the passage, Genesis 1:1: "In
the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." It is argued
that God's forethought for man in the work of creation affords
ground of comfort; and that mercy is shewn even in chastisement,
as in the saying, "Adam, where art thou?" Concluding admonition
on the avoidance of oaths.

HOMILY 8

An exhortation to virtue - and particularly upon the passage,
"God was walking in Paradise in the cool of the day:" - and
again on the subject of abstaining from oaths.

HOMILY 9

Commendation of those who laid aside the practice of swearing. It
is shewn that no one need scruple about hearing the divine oracles
in the Church after a meal. Answer to the question, Why it was so
long before the Holy Scriptures were given? Comment on the
passage, "The heavens declare the glory of God," with a
description of the natural world. And finally, an admonition against
swearing.

HOMILY 10

Commendation of those who came to hear after taking a meal.
Observations on the physiology of the natural world; and against
those who deify the creation; and on the duty of not swearing.

HOMILY 11

Thanksgiving to God for deliverance from the evils expected owing
to the sedition; and recollection of the events which took place at the
time. Also against those who find fault with the structure of the
human body, and in general concerning the creation of man; and,
in conclusion, on success in avoiding oaths.

HOMILY 12

Thanksgiving to God for the pardon granted to the offenders
against the Emperor. Physical discourse on the Creation. Proof
that God, in creating man, implanted in him a natural law. Duty of
avoiding oaths with the utmost diligence.

HOMILY 13

A further thanksgiving to God for the change in the late melancholy
aspect of affairs. Reminiscence of those who were dragged away,
and punished because of the sedition. Exposition on the subject of
the creation of man, and of his having received a natural law. Of
the complete accomplishment of abstinence from oaths.

HOMILY 14

After the whole people had been freed from all distress, and had
become assured of safety, certain persons again disturbed the city
by fabricating false reports, and were convicted. Wherefore this
Homily refers to that subject; and also to the admonition
concerning oaths; for which reason also, the history of Jonathan,
and Saul, and that of Jephthah, is brought forward; and it is shewn
how many perjuries result from one oath.

HOMILY 15

Again on the calamity of the city of Antioch. That fear is every way
profitable. That sorrow is more useful than laughter. And upon the
saying, "Remember that thou walkest in the midst of snares." And
that it is worse to exact an oath than to commit murder.

HOMILY 16

This Homily was delivered on the occasion of the Prefect entering
the Church, for the purpose of pacifying the minds of the people, in
consequence of a rumor of an intended sack having been
announced to him, when all were meditating flight. It treats also on
the subject of avoiding oaths, and on the words of the Apostle,
"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ.".

HOMILY 17

Of the Commissioners (Hellebichus, Commander of the Troops
and Caesarius, Master of the Offices) sent by the Emperor
Theodosius for the inquisition of the offenders, on account of the
over- turning of the Statues.

HOMILY 18

The former subject of the Sedition continued; also of fasting; and
upon the Apostolic saying, "Rejoice in the Lord always".

HOMILY 19

On the Sunday called Episozomenes, to those who had come to
Antioch from the country - also on the subject of avoiding oaths.

HOMILY 20

That the fast of Lent is not sufficient to make us competent to
partake of the Communion, but hat holiness is the first thing
required. How it is possible not to entertain resentment, and that
God takes much account of this law; and that the entertaining of
resentment punishes those who are guilty of it even before they
reach the place of torment. Also concerning abstinence from oaths,
and those who have not succeeded in abstaining from swearing.

HOMILY 21

On the return of Flavian the Bishop, and the reconciliation of the
Emperor with the city, and with those who had offended in
overthrowing the Statues.

HOMILIES OF ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM,

ARCHBISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE,

ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOCH,

CONCERNING THE STATUES

HOMILY 1

THE ARGUMENT

This Homily was delivered in the Old Church of Antioch, while St.
Chrysostom was yet a Presbyter, upon that saying of the Apostle, 1
Timothy 5:23, "Drink a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thy
often infirmities."

1. YE have heard the Apostolic voice, that trumpet from heaven, that
spiritual lyre! For even as a trumpet sounding a fearful and warlike note, it
both dismays the enemy, and arouses the dejected spirits on its own side,
and filling them with great boldness, renders those who attend to it
invincible against the devil! And again, as a lyre, that gently soothes with
soul-captivating melody, it puts to slumber the disquietudes of perverse
thoughts; and thus, with pleasure, instills into us much profit. Ye have
heard then today the Apostle discoursing to Timothy of divers necessary
matters! for he wrote to him as to the laying on of hands, saying, "Lay
hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins." And
he explained the grievous danger of such a transgression, by showing that
so men will undergo the punishment of the sins perpetrated by others, in
common with them, because they confer the power. on their wickedness
by the laying on of hands. Presently again he says, "Use a little wine for
thy stomach's sake, and thine often infirmities." Today also he has
discoursed to us concerning the subjection of servants, and the madness of

misers, as well as on the arrogance of the rich, and on various other
matters.

2. Since then it is impossible to go through every part, what part of the
words rehearsed would you have us select for the subject of our address to
your charity? For as in a meadow, I perceive in what has been read a great
diversity of flowers; a multiplicity of roses and violets, and of lilies not a
few; and everywhere the various and copious fruit of the Spirit is scattered
around, as well as an abundant fragrance. Yea, rather the reading of the
divine Scriptures is not a meadow only, but a paradise; for the flowers
here have not a mere fragrance only, but fruit too, capable of nourishing
the soul. What part then of the things rehearsed do you desire that we
bring before you this day? Do you wish what seems the more
insignificant, and easy for any one to understand, to be that which we
should handle at present? To me, indeed, this seems proper, and I doubt
not you will concur in this opinion. What then is this that might seem
plainer than anything else? What but that, which seems so easy, and
obvious for any one to say? Well what is that? "Use a little wine for thy
stomach's sake, and thine often infirmities." Well then, let us employ the
whole of our discourse upon this subject; and this we would do, not for
the love of praise, nor because we study to exhibit powers of oratory (for
the things about to be spoken are not our own, but such as the grace of the
Holy Spirit may inspire); but in order that we may stir up those hearers
who are too listless, and may convince them of the greatness of the
treasure of the holy Scriptures; and that it is neither safe, nor free from
peril, to run through them hastily. For if indeed a text so simple and
obvious as this one, which seems to the multitude to contain nothing that
need be insisted on, should appear to afford us the means of abundant
riches, and openings toward the highest wisdom, much rather will those
others, which at once manifest their native wealth, satisfy those who
attend to them with their infinite treasures. Assuredly then, we ought not
hastily to pass by even those sentences of Scripture which are thought to
be plain; for these also have proceeded from the grace of the Spirit; but
this grace is never small, nor mean, but great and admirable, and worthy
the munificence of the Giver.

3. Let us not therefore listen carelessly; since even they who roast the
metallic earth, when they have thrown it into the furnace, not only take up

the masses of gold, but also collect the small particles with the utmost
care. Inasmuch, then, as we likewise have to roast the gold drawn from the
Apostolic mines, not by casting it into the furnace, but by depositing it in
the thoughts of your souls; not lighting an earthly flame, but kindling the
fire of the Spirit, let us collect the little particles with diligence. For if the
saying be brief, yet is its virtue great. For pearls too have their proper
market, not owing to the size of the substance, but the beauty of their
nature. Even so is it with the reading of the divine Scriptures; for worldly
instruction rolls forth its trifles in abundance, and deluges its hearers with
a torrent of vain babblings, but dismisses them empty-handed, and
without having gathered any profit great or small. Not so however is it
with the grace of the Spirit, but, on the contrary, by means of small
sentences, it implants divine wisdom in all who give heed, and one
sentence often times affords to those who receive it a sufficient source of
provision for the whole journey of life.

4. Since then its riches are so great, let us arouse ourselves, and receive that
which is spoken with a watchful mind; for I am preparing to plunge our
discussion to an extreme depth. The admonition itself hath no doubt
seemed beside the purpose, and superfluous to many: and they are apt to
talk much in this way, "Was Timothy of himself not able to judge what it
was needful to make use of, and did he wait to learn this of his teacher.
And then did the teacher not only give directions, but also set them down
in writing, graying it there as on a column of brass in his Epistle to him?
and was he not ashamed to give directions about things of this nature,
when writing in a public manner, to his disciple?" For this end then, that
thou mayest learn that the admonition, so far from being beside the
purpose, was a necessary and highly profitable one; and that the thing
proceeded not from Paul, but from the grace of the Spirit, viz, that this
should have been (I say) not a spoken precept, but one deposited in
letters, and to be handed down to all future generations through the
Epistle, I shall proceed at once to the proof.

5. For besides the subjects which have been mentioned, there is another,
about which some are no less perplexed, enquiring within themselves on
what account God permitted a man possessing such confidence towards
Him, whose bones and relics expelled demons, to fall into such a state of
infirmity; for it is not merely that he was sick, but constantly, and for a

length of time; and by these recurring and prolonged infirmities he was not
permitted to have even a brief respite. "How does this appear," it may be
asked? From the very words of Paul, for he does not say, on account of
the "infirmity," but on account of the "infirmities;" and not merely
"infirmities," but he clearly speaks of these as being constant, when he
says "thine often infirmities." Let those then attend to this, whoever they
are, who being given over to a lingering sickness are querulous and dejected
under it.

6. But the subject of enquiry is not only, that being a holy man he was
sick, and sick so continually, but that he was at the same time entrusted
with the public affairs of the world. For if he had been one of those who
have retreated to the tops of mountains; who have fixed their cells in
solitude, and who have chosen that life which is free from all business, the
matter now enquired into were no such difficulty; but that one thrust
forward in the throng, and in whose hands the care of so many Churches
was placed, and who superintended whole cities and nations; nay, the
world at large, with so much alacrity and diligence, should be subjected to
the straitening of infirmities! This it is which may most of all bewilder one
who does not duly consider it. Because, even if not for himself, yet for
others at least, it was necessary he should have health. "He was the best
general," says the objector. "The war was waged by him, not only against
the unbeliever, but against demons, and against the devil himself. All the
enemy contended with much vehemence, scattering the forces, and
capturing prisoners; but this man was able to bring back myriads to the
truth, and yet he was sick! For if," he says, "no other injury to the cause
had come of this sickness, yet this alone was sufficient to discourage and
relax the faithful. If soldiers, when they see their general detained in bed,
become discouraged and slack for the fight, much rather was it probable
that the faithful should betray somewhat of human nature, when they saw
that teacher, who had wrought so many signs, in continual sickness and
suffering of body."

7. But this is not all. These skeptics propose yet a further enquiry, by
asking for what reason Timothy neither healed himself, nor was healed by
his instructor, when he was reduced to this state. Whilst the Apostles
raised the dead, cast out devils, and conquered death with abundant ease,
they could not even restore the body of one sick man! Although with

respect to other bodies, both during their own lives and after death, they
manifested such extraordinary power, they did not restore a stomach that
had lost its vigor! And what is more than this, Paul is not ashamed, and
does not blush, after the many and great signs which he had displayed
even by a simple word; yet, in writing to Timothy, to bid him take refuge
in the healing virtue of wine drinking. Not that to drink wine is shameful.
God forbid! For such precepts belong to heretics; but the matter of
astonishment is, that he accounted it no disgrace not to be able, without
this kind of assistance, to set one member right when it was disordered.
Nevertheless, he was so far from being ashamed of this, that he has made it
manifest to all posterity. You see then to what a depth we have brought
down the subject, and how that which seemed to be little, is full of
innumerable questions. Well then, let us proceed to the solution; for we
have explored the question thus deep, in order that, having excited your
attention, we might lay up the explanation in a safe storehouse.

8. But before I proceed to solve these questions, permit me to say
something of the virtue of Timothy, and of the loving care of Paul. For
what was ever more tender hearted than this man, who being so far distant,
and encircled with so many cares, exercised so much consideration for the
health of his disciple's stomach, and wrote with exact attention about the
correction of his disorder? And what could equal the virtue of Timothy?
He so despised luxury, and derided the sumptuous table, as to fall into
sickness from excessive austerity, and intense fasting. For that he was not
naturally so infirm a person, but had overthrown the strength of his
stomach by fasting and water drinking; you may hear Paul himself
carefully making this plain. For he does not simply say, "use a little
wine;" but having said before, "drink no longer water," he then brings
forward his counsel as to the drinking of wine. And this expression "no
longer" was a manifest proof, that till then he had drunk water, and on that
account was become infirm Who then would not wonder at his divine
wisdom and strictness? He laid hold on the very heavens, and sprang to
the highest point of virtue. And his Teacher testifies this, when he thus
speaks, "I have sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful
son in the Lord;" and when Paul calls him "a son," and a "faithful and
beloved son," these words are sufficient to show that he possessed every
kind of virtue. For the judgments of the saints are not given according to

favor or enmity, but are free from all prejudice. Timothy would not have
been so enviable, if he had been Paul's son naturally, as he was now
admirable, inasmuch as having no connection with him according to the
flesh, he introduced himself by the relationship of piety into the Apostle's
adoption; preserving the marks of his spiritual wisdom with exactness in
all things. For even as a young bullock linked to a bull, so he drew the
yoke along with him, to whatever part of the world he went: and did not
draw it the less on account of his youth, but his ready will made him
emulate the labors of his teacher. And of this, Paul himself was again a
witness when he said, "Let no man despise him, for he worketh the work
of the Lord as I also do." See you how he bears witness, that the ardor of
Timothy was the very counterpart of his own?

9. Furthermore, in order that he might not be thought to have said these
things out of favor or kindness, he makes his hearers themselves to be
witnesses of the virtue of his son, when he says, "But ye know the proof
of him, that, as a son with a father, so he hath served with me in the
Gospel;" that is, "ye have had experience of his virtue, and of his
approved soul." At the same time, however, that he had reached to this
height of good works, he did not thereby grow confident; but was full of
anxiety and fear, therefore also he fasted rigidly, and was not affected as
many are, who, when they have kept themselves to it but ten, or perhaps
twenty months, straightway give up the matter altogether. He, I say, was
in no wise thus affected, nor did he say anything like this to himself.
"What further need have I of fasting? I have gotten the mastery of myself;
I have overcome my lusts; I have mortified my body; I have affrighted
demons; I have driven away the devil; I have raised the dead; I have
cleansed lepers; I am become terrible to the adverse powers; what further
need have I of fasting, or to seek safety from that quarter?" Anything like
this he did not say, he did not think of; but, in proportion as he abounded
with innumerable good works, so much the more did he fear and tremble.
And he learnt this spiritual wisdom from his preceptor; for even he, after
he had been rapt into the third heaven, and transported to paradise; and
had heard unutterable words; and taken part in such mysteries; and
traversed the whole world, like some winged being, when he wrote to the
Corinthians, said, I fear "lest by any means having preached to others, I
myself should be a castaway." And if Paul was afraid after so many signal

good works; he who was able to say, "The world is crucified unto me, and
I unto the world;" much more does it become us to fear; and the rather in
proportion as we have stored up numerous good works. For then the devil
becomes fiercer; then he is more savage, when he beholds us regulating our
lives with carefulness! When he sees the cargo of virtue stowed together,
and the lading become heavy, then he is in haste to accomplish a more
grievous shipwreck! For the insignificant and abject man, although he may
be supplanted and fall, brings not so great an injury to the common cause.
But the man who has been standing most conspicuously as it were on
some eminence of virtue, and who is one manifestly seen and known of all
men, and admired of all; when he is assaulted and falls, causes great ruin
and loss. Not only because he falls from this elevation but makes many of
those who look up to him more negligent. And as it is in the body, some
other limb may be destroyed without there being any great damage, but if
the eyes be deprived of sight, or the head be seriously injured, the whole
body is rendered useless; so also we must say of the saints, and of those
who have performed the highest good works; when such are extinguished,
when they contract any stain, they bring upon all the rest of the body a
universal and, intolerable injury!

10. Timothy then, being aware of all these things, fortified himself on
every side; for he knew that youth is an age of difficulty; that it is
unstable; easily deceived; very apt to slip; and requires an exceedingly
strong bridle. It is indeed a sort of combustible pile easily catching
anything from without, and quickly kindled; and for that reason he took
care to smother it on all sides; and strove to abate the flame in every way.
The steed that was unmanageable and restive he curbed with much
vehemence, until he had tamed him of his wanton tricks; until he had made
him docile; and delivered him under entire control, into the hands of that
reason which is the charioteer. "Let the body," saith he, "be infirm; but let
not the soul be infirm; let the flesh be bridled; but let not the race of the
spirit towards heaven be checked." But moreover, one might especially
wonder at the man for this, that being thus diseased, and struggling with
such an infirmity, he did not become indifferent to God's business, but
flew everywhere faster than those who have sound and vigorous
constitutions; now to Ephesus; now to Corinth; often to Macedonia and
Italy; appearing everywhere, by land and by sea, with the Teacher, sharing

in everything his struggles and continuous dangers; while the spiritual
wisdom of his soul was not put to shame by his bodily infirmity. Such a
thing is zeal for God! such lightness of wing does it impart. For as with
those who possess well-regulated and sound constitutions, strength is of
no avail, if the soul is abject, slothful, and stupid; so with those who are
reduced to extreme weakness, no hurt arises from their infirmity, if the
soul be noble and well awake.

11. The admonition however, and the counsel, such as it is, appears to
some to give authority for drinking wine too freely. But this is not so. If
indeed we closely investigate this very saying, it rather amounts to a
recommendation of abstinence. For just consider that Paul did not at first,
nor at the outset give this counsel. But when he saw that all strength was
overthrown, then he gave it; and even then not simply, but with a certain
prior limitation. He does not say merely, "Use wine," but "a little" wine;
not because Timothy needed this admonition and advice, but because we
need it. On this account, in writing to him, he prescribes the measure and
limit of wine-drinking for us; bidding him drink just so much as would
correct disorder; as would bring health to the body, but not another
disease. For the immoderate drinking of wine produces not fewer diseases
of body and of soul, than much drinking of water, but many more, and
more severe; bringing in as it does upon the mind the war of the passions,
and a tempest of perverse thoughts, besides reducing the firmness of the
body to a relaxed and flaccid condition. For the nature of land that is long
disturbed by a superabundance of water, is not thereby so much dissolved,
as the force of the human frame is enfeebled, relaxed, and reduced to a state
of exhaustion, by the continual swilling of wine. Let us guard then against
a want of moderation on either side, and let us take care of the health of
the body, at the same time that we prune away its luxurious propensities.
For wine was given us of God, not that we might be drunken, but that we
might be sober; that we might be glad, not that we get ourselves pain.
"Wine," it says, "maketh glad the heart of man," but thou makest it matter
for sadness; since those who are inebriated are sullen beyond measure, and
great darkness over-spreads their thoughts. It is the best medicine, when it
has the best moderation to direct it. The passage before us is useful also
against heretics, who speak evil of God's creatures; for if it had been
among the number of things forbidden, Paul would not have permitted it,

nor would have said it was to be used. And not only against the heretics,
but against the simple ones among our brethren, who when they see any
persons disgracing themselves from drunkenness, instead of reproving
such, blame the fruit given them by God, and say, "Let there be no wine."
We should say then in answer to such, "Let there be no drunkenness; for
wine is the work of God, but drunkenness is the work of the devil. Wine
maketh not drunkenness; but intemperance produceth it. Do not accuse
that which is the workmanship of God, but accuse the madness of a fellow
mortal. But thou, while omitting to reprove and correct the sinner, treatest
thy Benefactor with contempt!"

12. When, therefore, we hear men saying such things, we should stop their
mouths; for it is not the use of Wine, but the want of moderation which
produces drunkenness, Drunkenness! that root of all evils. Wine was given
to restore the body's weakness, not to overturn the soul's strength; to
remove the sickness of the flesh, not to destroy the health of the spirit. Do
not then, by using the gift of God immoderately, afford a handle to the
foolish and the impudent. For what is a more wretched thing than
drunkenness! The drunken man is a living corpse. Drunkenness is a demon
self-chosen, a disease without excuse, an overthrow that admits of no
apology; a common shame to our kind. The drunken man is not only
useless in our assemblies; not only in public and private affairs; but the
bare sight of him is the most disgusting of all things, his breath being
stench. The belchings, and gapings, and speech of the intoxicated, are at
once unpleasant and offensive, and are utterly abhorrent to those who see
and converse with them; and the crown of these evils is, that this disease
makes heaven inaccessible to drunkards, and does not suffer them to win
eternal blessedness: for besides the shame attending those who labor under
this disease here, a grievous punishment is also awaiting them there! Let us
cut off then this evil habit, and let us hear Paul saying, "Use a little wine."
For even this little he permits him on account of his infirmity; so that if
infirmity had not troubled him, he would not have forced his disciple to
allow himself even a small quantity, since it is fitting that we should
always mete out even the needful meat and drink, which are given us, by
occasions and necessities; and by no means go beyond our need, nor do
anything unmeaningly and to no purpose.

13. But since we have now learnt the tender care of Paul, and the virtue of
Timothy, come and let us, in the next place, turn our discourse to the
actual solution of those questions. What then are the questions? For it is
necessary again to mention them, that the solution of them may be plainer.
For what reason then did God permit that such a saint, and one entrusted
with the management of so many matters, should fall into a state of
disease; and that neither Timothy himself nor his teacher had strength to
correct the disorder, but needed that assistance which was to be had by
drinking wine? Such, indeed, were the questions proposed. But it is
needful to bring forward a precise solution; so that if any should fall not
only into the like sickness and disease, but into poverty, and hunger, and
bonds, and torments, and discomfitures, and calumnies, and into all those
evils which belong to the present life, although they were great and
wonderful saints, you may still be able to find, even for their case, in the
things which are today to be advanced, an exact and very clear reply to
those who are disposed to find fault. For ye have heard many asking such
questions, as, "Why ever is it that such an one, a moderate and meek man,
comes to be dragged daily before the seat of judgment by another who is
lawless and wicked, and to suffer evils without number, and God permits
this? For what reason again was another man, upon false accusation,
unjustly put to death?" "Such a man," says the objector, "was drowned;
another was thrown down a precipice; and we might speak of many saints,
as well in our own days as in the days of our forefathers, who have
suffered divers and chequered tribulations." To the end, therefore, that we
may see the reason of these things, and that we ourselves may not be
disturbed, nor overlook the case of others who thus meet with a
stumbling-block, we should attend with earnest heed to the reasons now
about to be advanced.

14. For of the diversified and manifold affliction which befalls the saints, I
have reasons eight in number to declare unto your love. Therefore let all
direct themselves to me with the strictest attention, knowing that there
will be no pardon nor excuse left us hereafter for stumbling at the things
which happen, if after all, when there are so many reasons, we are just as
much perplexed and disturbed as if there were not one to be found.

The first reason then is, that God permits them to suffer evil, that they
may not too easily be exalted into presumption, by the greatness of their
good works and miracles.

The second, that others may not have a greater opinion of them than
belongs to human nature, and take them to be gods and not men.

The third, that the power of God may be made manifest, in prevailing, and
overcoming, and advancing the word preached, through the efficacy of men
who are infirm and in bonds.

The fourth, that the endurance of these themselves may become more
striking, serving God, as they do, not for a reward; but showing even such
right-mindedness as to give proof of their undiminished good will towards
Him after so many evils.

The fifth, that our minds may be wise concerning the doctrine of a
resurrection. For when thou seest a just man, and one abounding in virtue,
suffering ten thousand evils, and thus departing the present life, thou art
altogether compelled, though unwillingly, to think somewhat of the future
judgment; for if men do not suffer those who have labored for themselves,
to depart without wages and recompense; much more cannot God design,
that those who have so greatly labored should be sent away uncrowned.
But if He cannot intend to deprive those of the recompense of their labors
eventually, there must needs be a time, after the end of the life here, in
which they will receive the recompense of their present labors.

The sixth, that all who fall into adversity may have a sufficient consolation
and alleviation, by looking at such persons, and remembering what
sufferings have befallen them.

The seventh, that when we exhort you to the virtue of such persons, and
we say to every one of you, "Imitate Paul, emulate Peter," ye may not, on
account of the surpassing character of their good works, sloth-fully shrink
from such an imitation of them, as deeming them to have been partakers of
a different nature.

The eighth, that when it is necessary to call any blessed, or the reverse, we
may learn whom we ought to account happy, and whom unhappy and
wretched.

These then are the reasons; but it is necessary to establish them all from
the Scriptures, and to show with exactness that all that has been said on
this subject is not an invention of human reasoning, but the very sentence
of the Scriptures. For thus will what we say be at once more deserving of
credit, and sink the deeper into your minds.

15. That tribulation then is profitable to the saints, that they may exercise
moderation and lowliness, and that they may not be puffed up by their
miracles and good works, and that God permits it for this end; we may
hear David the prophet, and Paul saying the same. The former says, "It is
good for me, Lord, that I have been in trouble, that I might learn thy
statutes:" and the latter having said, "I was caught up into the third
heaven, and" transported to Paradise, goes on to say, "And lest I should
be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there
was given me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me."
What can be clearer than this? "That I might not be exalted above
measure," for this reason, saith he, God permitted "the messengers of
Satan to buffet me;" by messengers of Satan, indeed, he means not
particular demons, but men ministering for the devil, the unbelievers, the
tyrants, the heathens, who perseveringly molested, and unceasingly
worried him. And what he says is just this: "God was able to repress
these persecutions and successive tribulations; but since I had been caught
up into the third heaven, and transported to Paradise, lest through the
abundance of these revelations I might be lifted up and think much of
myself, he permitted these persecutions, and suffered these messengers of
Satan to buffet me with persecutions and afflictions, that I might not be
too much exalted." For although Paul and Peter, and all that are like them,
be holy and wonderful men, as indeed they are, yet they are but men, and
require much caution lest they should be too easily exalted; and as saints
more than others. For nothing is so apt to exalt to presumption as a
conscience full of good works, and a soul that lives in confidence. To the
end, therefore, that these might suffer nothing of this kind, God permitted
that there should be temptations and tribulations; these being powerful to
keep them down, and to persuade to the exercise of moderation in all
things.

16. That this very particular also contributes much to the showing forth of
God's power, you may learn even from the same Apostle, who told us the

former. In order that you may not say, (what indeed unbelievers think),
that God in permitting this, is some infirm being, and suffers such persons
to be continually afflicted, from not being able to deliver His own from
dangers: this very thing, I say, observe how Paul has demonstrated by
means of these events, showing not only that the events were far from
accusing Him of weakness, but that they proved His power more
strikingly to all. For having said, "There was given me a thorn in the flesh;
a messenger of Satan to buffet me," and having thus signified his repeated
trials, he goes on to add, "For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it
might depart from me; and He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for
thee, for My strength is perfected in weakness." "My power," He means,
"is seen then when ye are in weakness; and yet through you, who seem to
grow weak, the word preached is magnified, and is sown in all quarters."
When therefore he was led to the dungeon, after having received a great
number of stripes, he took prisoner the keeper of the prison. His feet were
in the stocks, and his hands in the chain; and the prison shook at midnight
while they were singing hymns. See you, how His power was perfected in
weakness? If Paul had been at large, and had shaken that building, the thing
would not have been so wonderful. "For this reason," He saith, "remain
bound; and the walls shall be shaken on every side, and the prisoners shall
be loosed; in order that My power may appear the greater, when through
thee, confined and in fetters, all that are in bonds shall be loosed." This
very circumstance then it was which at the time astounded the keeper of
the prison, that being so forcibly confined, he, through prayer alone,
prevailed to shake the foundations, and throw open the doors of the
prison, and to unbind all the prisoners. Nor is this the only occasion. But
with Peter too, and Paul himself, as well as the other disciples, one may
see this occurring constantly; and in the midst of persecution, the grace of
God ever flourishing, and appearing by the side of the tribulations, and
thus proclaiming His power. Wherefore He saith, "My grace is sufficient
for thee, for My strength is perfected in weakness."

17. But to show that many would be too often ready to imagine things of
them above human nature, unless they saw them enduring such afflictions,
hear how Paul was afraid on this very point; "For though I would desire to
glory, I shall not be a fool, but now I forbear, lest any man should think of
me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me." But

what is it that he means? I am able, he declares, to speak of far greater
miracles; but I am unwilling; lest the magnitude of the miracles should raise
too high a notion of me among men. For this reason Peter also, when they
had restored the lame man, and all were wondering at them, in order to
restrain the people, and persuade them that they had exhibited nothing of
this power of themselves, or from their native strength, says, "Why look
ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had
made this man to walk?" And again at Lystra, the people were not only
filled with astonishment, but led forth bulls, after crowning them with
garlands, and were preparing to offer sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas.
Observe the malice of the Devil. By those very same persons through
whom the Lord was at work, to purge out ungodliness from the world, by
the same did that enemy try to introduce it, again persuading them to take
men for gods; which was what he had done in former times. And this is
especially that which introduced the principle and root of idolatry. For
many after having had success in wars, and set up trophies, and built
cities, and done divers other benefits of this kind to the people of those
times, came to be esteemed gods by the multitude, and were honored with
temples, and altars; and the whole catalogue of the Grecian gods is made
up of such men. That this, therefore, may not be done towards the Saints,
God permitted them constantly to be banished, - to be scourged, - to
fall into diseases; that the abundance of bodily infirmity, and the
multiplicity of those temptations, might convince those who were then
with them, both that they were men, who wrought such wonders, and that
they contributed nothing of their own power; but that it was mere grace,
that wrought through them all these miracles. For if they took men for
gods, who had done but mean and vile things, much rather would they
have thought these to be such, had they suffered nothing proper to
humanity, when they performed miracles, such as no one had ever before
Seen or heard of. For if when they were scourged, thrown down
precipices, imprisoned, banished, and placed in peril every day, there
were, notwithstanding, some who fell into this impious opinion, how
much rather would they have been thus regarded, had they endured
nothing which belongs to human nature I

18. This then is the third cause of affliction; and the fourth is, that the
saints might not be supposed to serve God from a hope of present

prosperity. For many of those who live in debauchery, when blamed as
they often are by many, and invited to the labors of virtue; and when they
hear the saints commended for their cheerfulness under great hardships,
attack their character on this ground; and not men only, but the devil
himself hath taken up this suspicion. For when Job was surrounded with
great wealth, and enjoyed much opulence, that wicked demon, being
reproached by God on his account, and having nothing to say; when he
could neither answer the accusations against himself, nor impugn the virtue
of this just man; took refuge at once in this defense, speaking thus, "Doth
Job fear thee for nought? Hast thou not made an hedge about him on all
sides." "For reward then," saith he, "that man is virtuous, enjoying
thereby so much opulence." What then did God? Being desirous to show,
that it was not for reward that his saints serve Him, He stripped him of all
his opulence; gave him over to poverty; and permitted him to fall into
grievous disease. Afterwards reproving him, that he had suspected thus
without cause, He saith, "He let holdeth fast his integrity; to no purpose
didst thou move me to destroy his substance." For it is a sufficient reward,
and compensation to the saints, that they are serving God; since this
indeed to the lover is reward enough, to love the object of his love; and he
seeks nothing besides, nor accounts anything greater than this. And if such
be the case with regard to a man, much more in relation to God; which
therefore that God might demonstrate, He gave more than the devil asked;
for the latter said, "Put forth thine hand, and touch him;" but God said not
thus, but, "I deliver him unto thee." For just as in the contests of the outer
world, the combatants that are vigorous, and in high condition of body, are
not so well discended, when they are enwrapt all around with the garment
soaked in oil; but when casting this aside, they are brought forward
unclothed into the arena; then above all they strike the spectators on every
side with astonishment at the proportion of their limbs, there being no
longer anything to conceal them; so also was it with Job. When he was
enveloped in all that wealth, it was not visible to the many, what a man he
was. But when, like the wrestler, that strips off his garment, he threw it
aside, and came naked to the conflicts of piety, thus unclothed, he
astonished all who saw him; so that the very theater of angels shouted at
beholding his fortitude of soul, and applauded him as he won his crown!
For, as I have already observed, he was not so well seen of men, when clad
in all that wealth, as when, casting it away like a garment, he exhibited

himself naked as it were in a theater, in the midst of the world, and all
admired his vigor of soul, evidenced as this was not only by his being
stripped of all things, but by the conflict, and by his patience in respect of
his infirmity. And as I said before, God Himself did not smite him; in
order that the devil might not again say, "Thou hast spared him, and hast
not inflicted so great a trial as was necessary:" but he gave to the adversary
the destruction of his cattle, and power over his flesh. "I am sure," saith
He, "of this wrestler; therefore I do not forbid thee to impose on him
whatever struggles thou desirest." But as those who are well skilled in the
sports of the palaestra, and have reason to rely on their art and bodily
strength, often do not seize their antagonists upright, nor take an equal
advantage, but suffer them to take them by the middle, that they may
make a more splendid conquest; so also God gave to the devil to take this
saint by the waist, that when he had overcome, after an attack so greatly
to his disadvantage, and stretched his adversary on the ground, his crown
might be so much the more glorious!

19. It is tried gold! Try it as thou desirest; examine it as thou wishest, thou
wilt not find in it any dross. This shows us not only the fortitude of
others, but also brings much farther consolation; for what saith Christ,
"Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall
say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be
exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven: for in like manner did
their fathers unto the prophets." Again, Paul writing to the Macedonians
in his desire to console them, says, "For ye, brethren, became followers of
the churches of God which are in Judea. For ye also have suffered like
things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews." And
again, he consoles the Hebrews in like manner, reckoning up all the just
who had lived in furnaces; in pits; in deserts; in mountains; in caves; in
hunger; and in poverty. For communion of suffering brings some
consolation to the fallen.

20. But that this also introduces arguments for the resurrection, hear the
same Paul again, saying, "If after the manner of men I have fought with
beasts at Ephesus, what shall it profit me if the dead are not raised." And
further, "If in this life only we have hope, we are of all men the most
miserable." We suffer, he tells us, innumerable evils during the present life;
if then there is no other life to be hoped for, what can be more wretched

than our condition? Hence it is evident that our affairs are not bounded
Within the limits of this present state; and this becomes manifest from our
trials. For God could never suffer those who have endured so many and so
great evils, and who have spent all the present life in trials and dangers
without number, to be without a recompense of far greater gifts; and if he
could not suffer this, it is certain that he has prepared another, a better and
brighter life, in which he will crown those who have wrestled in the cause
of godliness, and proclaim their praises in the presence of the whole world.
So that when you see a just man straitened and afflicted; and in sickness,
and in poverty, as well as innumerable other woes, till he ends this present
life; say to thyself, that if there were no resurrection and judgment, God
would not have permitted one, who endured such great evils for His sake,
to depart hence without enjoying any good thing; from whence it is
evident, that for such He has prepared another life, and one which is
sweeter and much more endurable. For if it were not so, then he would not
suffer many of the wicked to luxuriate through the present life; and many
of the just to remain in ten thousand ills: but since there is provided
another life, in which he is about to recompense every man according to
his deserts; one for his wickedness, another for his virtue; on that account
he forbears, while he sees the former enduring evil, and the latter living in
luxury.

21. And that other reason too I wilt endeavor to bring forward from the
Scriptures. But what was it? It was, that we might not say, when exhorted
to the same virtue, that they were partakers of another nature, or were not
men. On this account, a certain one speaking of the great Elias, says, "Elias
was a man of like passions with us." Do you perceive, that he shows from
a communion of suffering, that he was the same kind of man that we are?
And again, "I too am a man of like passions with you." And this
guarantees a community of nature.

22. But that you may learn that this also teaches us to consider those
blessed whom we ought to consider blessed, is evident from hence. For
when you hear Paul saying, "Even unto this present hour we both hunger,
and thirst, and are naked, and are buffetted, and have no certain dwelling
place." And again; "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteheth, and scourgeth
every son whom he receiveth;" it is certain that it is not those who are
enjoying quietness, but those who are in affliction for God's sake, and

who are in tribulation, whom we must applaud, emulating those who live
virtuously, and cultivate piety. For so speaks the prophet: "Their right
hand is a right hand of iniquity. Their daughters beautified, ornamented
after the similitude of a temple. Their garners full, bursting from one into
another; their sheep fruitful; abundant in their streets; their oxen fat. There
is no breaking down of the fence, nor passage through; nor clamor in their
streets. They call the people blessed whose affairs are in this state." But
what dost thou say, O prophet? "Blessed," saith he, "the people whose
God is the Lord;" not the people affluent in wealth, but one adorned with
godliness; that people, saith he, I esteem happy, although they suffer
innumerable hardships!

23. But if it were necessary to add a ninth reason, we might say, that this
tribulation maketh those who are troubled more approved; "For tribulation
worketh patience; and patience, probation; and probation, hope; and hope
maketh not ashamed." Do you see that the probation, which comes of
tribulation, fixes in us the hope of the good things to come, and that the
abiding in trials causes us to have a good hope of the future? So that I did
not say rashly, that these tribulations themselves mark out to us hopes of
a resurrection, and make those who are tried the better; for, he saith, "as
gold is tried in a furnace, so an acceptable man in the furnace of
humiliation."

24. There is besides a tenth reason to mention; and what is it, but the one I
have before frequently referred to? viz. that if we have any spots, we thus
put them away. And the patriarch, making this matter plain, said to the
rich man, "Lazarus hath received his evil things," hence "he is comforted."
And besides this, we may find another reason, which is to this effect; that
our crowns and rewards are thus increased. For in proportion as
tribulations are more intense, so also are the rewards augmented; yea, even
far more: "for the sufferings of the present time," it is said, "are not
worthy to be compared to the glory that shall be revealed in us." Thus
many then being the reasons which we have to advance for the afflictions
of the saints, let us not take our trials amiss, or be distressed, or disturbed
on account of them; but both ourselves discipline our own souls, and teach
others to do the same.

25. And if, O beloved, thou seest a man living in virtue, keeping fast hold
of spiritual wisdom, pleasing God, yet suffering innumerable ills, do not
stumble! And although thou seest any one devoting himself to spiritual
affairs, and about to achieve something useful, yet presently supplanted,
be not discouraged! For I know there are many who ofttimes propose a
question to this effect: "Such a one," say they, "was performing a
pilgrimage to some Martyr's shrine; and whilst conveying money to the
poor, met with a shipwreck, and lost all. Another man, in doing the like,
fell among robbers, and scarcely saved his life, leaving the place in a state
of nudity." What then should we say? Why that in neither of these cases
need one be sad. For if the one met with a shipwreck, yet he hath the fruit
of his righteousness complete inasmuch as he fulfilled all his own part. He
collected the money together, he stowed it away, he took it with him, he
departed on his pilgrimage; but the shipwreck that followed was not of his
own will. "But why did God permit it?" In order that he might make the
man approved. "But," says one, "the poor were deprived of the money."
Thou dost not so care for the poor, as the God who made them? for if
they were deprived of these things, He is able to provide a greater supply
of wealth for them from another quarter.

26. Let us not then call Him to account for what He does; but let us give
Him glory in all things. For it is not lightly and to no purpose that He
often permits such events. But beside that He does not overlook those
that would have enjoyed comfort from such wealth; and instead of it,
affords them some other supply of sustenance; He also makes him who
suffers the shipwreck more approved, and provides him a greater reward;
inasmuch as the giving thanks to God, when one falls into such calamities,
is a far greater matter than giving alms. For not what we give in alms only,
but whatever we have been deprived of by others, and born it with
fortitude; this too brings us much fruit. And that you may learn, that the
latter is indeed the greater thing, I will make it evident from what befell
Job. He, when a possessor of wealth, opened his house to the poor, and
whatever he had he bestowed; but he was not so illustrious when he
opened his house to the poor, as when, upon hearing that his house had
fallen down, he did not take it impatiently. He was not illustrious when he
clad the naked with the fleece of his flock, as he was illustrious and
renowned when he heard that the fire had fallen, and consumed all his

flocks, and yet gave thanks. Before, he was a lover of man; now, he was a
lover of Wisdom. Before, he had compassion on the poor; but now he gave
thanks to the Lord! And he did not say to himself, "Why is it that this
hath happened? The flocks are consumed from which thousands of the
poor were supported; and if I was unworthy to enjoy such plenty, at least
He should have spared me for the sake of the partakers."

27. Nothing of this sort did Job utter, no nor think, because he knew that
God was dispensing all things for good. That you may learn, moreover,
that he gave a heavier blow to the devil after this, when, being stripped of
all things, he gave thanks, than when, being in possession of them, he gave
alms; observe, that when he was in possession, the devil could utter a
certain suspicion, and however false, he yet could utter it: "Doth Job serve
thee for nought?" But when he had taken all, and stripped him of
everything, and the man yet retained the same good will towards God,
from that time his shameless mouth was stopped, and had nothing further
to allege. For the just man was more illustrious than in his former state.
For to bear nobly and thankfully the privation of all things, is a far greater
thing than it was to give alms whilst living in affluence; and it has been
accordingly demonstrated in the case of this just man. Before, there was
much benignity to his fellow-servants; now, there was exceeding love
shown towards the Lord!

28. And I do not lengthen out this discourse without purpose; forasmuch
as there are many, who, often whilst engaged in works of mercy, as
supporting widows, have been spoiled of all their substance. Some again,
by the accident of some fire, have lost their all; some have met with
shipwreck; others, by false informations and injuries of that sort, though
they have done many alms-deeds, have fallen into the extremes of poverty,
sickness, and disease, and have obtained no help from any one. Lest we
should say then, as many often do, "No man knoweth anything;" what has
just been said may suffice to remove all perplexity on this point. Suppose
it is objected that "such an one, after having done many alms-deeds, has
lost all?" And what if he had lost all? If he gives thanks for this loss, he
will draw down much greater favor from God! And he will not receive
twofold, as Job did, but a hundredfold in the life to come. But if here he
does endure evil, the very circumstance of his sustaining all with fortitude
will bring him a greater treasure; for God permits him to fall from plenty

to poverty, for the purpose of calling him thus to the more frequent
exercises, and greater conflicts. Hath it happened as is often the case, that
the fire seizing upon thy house, hath burnt it up and devoured all thy
substance? Remember what happened to Job; give thanks to the Lord,
who though he was able to forbid, did not forbid it; and thou wilt receive
as great a reward as if thou hadst deposited all thy wealth in the hands of
the poor! But dost thou spend thy days in poverty and hunger, and in the
midst of a thousand dangers? Remember Lazarus who had to buffet with
disease, and poverty, and desolateness, and those other innumerable trials;
and that after so high a degree of virtue! Remember the Apostles, who
lived in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness; the prophets, the patriarchs, the
just men, and you will find all these not among the rich or luxurious, but
among the poor, the afflicted, and the distressed!

29. Saying these things to thyself, give thanks unto the Lord, that he hath
made thee to be of this part, not hating thee, but loving thee greatly; since
He would not have permitted those men either to suffer thus, if he had not
exceedingly loved them, because He made them more illustrious by these
evils. There is nothing so good as thanksgiving; even as there is nothing
worse than blasphemy. We should not wonder that when we become
intent upon spiritual things, we suffer much that is grievous. For as
thieves do not dig through and assiduously keep watch there, where there
is hay, and chaff, and straw, but where there is gold and silver; so also the
devil besets those especially who are engaged in spiritual matters. Where
virtue is, there are many snares! where alms-giving is, there is envy! But
we have one weapon which is the best, and sufficient to repel all such
engines as these; in everything to give thanks to God. Tell me, did not
Abel, when offering the first fruits to God, fall by the hand of his brother?
But yet God permitted it, not hating one who had honored him, but loving
him greatly; and beside that which came of that excellent sacrifice,
providing him another crown by martyrdom. Moses wished to protect a
certain one who was injured, and he was put into the extremest peril, and
banished his country. This too God permitted, that thou mightest learn the
patience of the saints. For if, foreknowing that we should suffer nothing of
a grievous kind, we then put our hands to the work of religion, we should
not seem to be doing anything great, as having such a pledge of safety. But
as it is, those who do such things are the more to be wondered at, even for

this; because, though they foresee dangers, and punishments, and deaths,
and ten thousand evils, still they did not desist from those good works,
nor become less zealous from the expectation of terrors

30. As, therefore, the Three Children said, "There is a God in heaven, who
is able to deliver us; and if not, let it be known unto thee, O king, that we
will not serve thy gods, and that we will not worship the golden image
which thou hast set up." Do thou also, when about to perform any duty
to God, look forward to manifold dangers, manifold punishments,
manifold deaths; and be not surprised, nor be disturbed, if such things
happen. For it is said, "My Son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare
thy soul for temptation." For surely no one choosing to right, expects to
carry off the crown without wounds! And thou, therefore, who hast
undertaken to wage a complete combat with the devil, think not to pursue
a life without danger, and full of luxury! God hath not pledged to thee His
recompense and His promise here; but everything that is splendid for thee
in the future life! Be glad and rejoice then, if when thou hast thyself done
any good action, thou receive the contrary, or if thou See another suffering
this; inasmuch as this becomes to thee the source of a higher recompense!
Do not be downcast: nor give up thy zeal, nor become the more torpid;
but rather press onward with more eagerness; since even the Apostles,
when they preached, although scourged, stoned, and constant inmates of
the prisons, did not only after deliverance from dangers, but also in those
very dangers, announce with greater forwardness the message of Truth.
Paul is to be seen in prison, yea, even in chains, instructing and initiating:
and moreover doing the very same in a court of justice, in shipwreck, in
tempest, and in a thousand dangers. Do thou too imitate these saints, and
cease not from good works, so long as thou art able; and although thou
seest the devil thwarting thee ten thousand times, never fall back! Thou
perchance, bearing with thee thy wealth, hast met with shipwreck; but
Paul carrying the word, far more precious than all wealth, was going to
Rome, and was wrecked; and sustained innumerable hardships. And this
he himself signified, when he said, "Many times we desired to come unto
you, but Satan hindered us." And God permitted it; thus revealing the
more abundantly His power, and showing that the multitude of things
which the devil did, or prevented from being done, neither lessened nor
interrupted the preaching of the Gospel. On this account Paul gave God

thanks in all things; and knowing that he was himself thereby rendered
more approved, he exhibited his exceeding forwardness on every occasion,
letting none of these impediments prevent him!

31. As often then as we are frustrated in spiritual works, so often let us
again take them in hand; and let us not say, "for what reason did God
permit these impediments?" for He permitted them to this end, that He
might show thy alacrity much more to others, and thy great love; this
being the special mark of one that loves, never to desist from those things
which are approved by him whom he loves. The man, indeed, who is
flaccid and listless, will fall back from the first shock; but he who is
energetic and alert, although he be hindered a thousand times, will devote
himself so much the more to the things of God; fulfilling all as far as he is
able; and in everything giving thanks. This then let us do! Thanksgiving is
a great treasure; large wealth; a good that cannot be taken away; a powerful
weapon! Even as blasphemy increases our present mishap; and makes us
lose much more beside than we have lost already. Hast thou lost money?
If thou hast been thankful, thou hast gained thy soul; and obtained greater
wealth; having acquired a greater measure of the favor of God. But if thou
blasphemest, thou hast, besides this, lost thine own safety; and hast not
regained possession of thy wealth; yea and thy soul, which thou hadst,
thou hast sacrificed!

32. But since our discourse has now turned to the subject of blasphemy, I
desire to ask one favor of you all, in return for this my address, and
speaking with you; which is, that you will correct on my behalf the
blasphemers of this city. And should you hear any one in the public
thoroughfare, or in the midst of the forum, blaspheming God; go up to him
and rebuke him; and should it be necessary to inflict blows, spare not to
do so. Smite him on the face; strike his mouth; sanctify thy hand with the
blow, and if any should accuse thee, and drag thee to the place of justice,
follow them thither; and when the judge on the bench calls thee to account,
say boldly that the man blasphemed the King of angels! For if it be
necessary to punish those who blaspheme an earthly king, much more so
those who insult God. It is a common crime, a public injury; and it is
lawful for every one who is willing, to bring forward an accusation. Let the
Jews and Greeks learn, that the Christians are the saviors of the city; that
they are its guardians, its patrons, and its teachers. Let the dissolute and

the perverse also learn this; that they must fear the servants of God too;
that if at any time they are inclined to utter such a thing, they may look
round every way at each other, and tremble even at their own shadows,
anxious lest perchance a Christian, having heard what they said, should
spring upon them and sharply chastise them. Have you not heard what
John did? He saw a man that was a tyrant overthrowing the laws of
marriage; and with boldness, he proclaimed in the midst of the forum, "It
is not lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip's wife." But I urge thee
on, not against a prince or a judge; nor against the marriage ordinance
outraged; nor in behalf of fellow-servants insulted. But I require thee to
castigate an equal, for insolence against the Lord. Truly, if I had said unto
thee, punish and correct those kings or judges who transgress the laws,
would you not say that I was mad? But John forsooth acted thus. So that
even this is not too much for us. Now then, at least, correct a
fellow-servant; an equal; and although it should be necessary to die, do not
shrink from chastising a brother. This is thy martyrdom, since John was
also a martyr. And although he was not commanded to sacrifice, nor to
worship an idol, yet for the sacred laws that were despised, he laid down
his head. Do thou too then contend, even to the death, for the truth, and
God will fight for thee! And make me not this cold reply. "What matters it
to me? I have nothing in common with him." With the devil alone we have
nothing in common, but with all men we have many things in common; for
they partake of the same nature with us; they inhabit the same earth, and
they are nourished with the same food; they have the same Lord; they
have received the same laws, and are invited to the same blessings with
ourselves. Let us not say then, that we have nothing in common with
them; for this is a satanic speech; a diabolical inhumanity. Therefore let us
not give utterance to such words, but exhibit such a tender care as becomes
brethren!

33. This indeed I, for my part, engage with the strictest certainty, and
pledge myself to you all, that if all you who are present will but choose to
take in hand the safety of the inhabitants of this city, we shall speedily
have it amended throughout. And this, even although but the least part of
the city is here; the least as to multitude, but the chief part as it respects
piety. Let us take in hand the safety of our brethren! One man inflamed
with zeal is sufficient to reform a whole community! But when not merely

one, or two, or three, but so great a multitude are able to take on them the
care of the neglected, it is in no other way but by our own supineness, and
not from our want of strength, that the majority perish and fall. Is it not
indeed absurd? When we happen to see a fight taking place in the forum,
we go into the midst of it, and reconcile the combatants! But why do I
speak of a fight? If, perchance, we see an ass fallen down, we all make
haste to stretch out a hand to raise him up. Yet we neglect our perishing
brethren! The blasphemer is an ass; unable to bear the burden of his anger,
he has fallen. Come forward and raise him up, both by words and by
deeds; and both by meekness and by vehemence; let the medicine be
various. And if we thus administer our own part, and take pains for the
safety of our neighbors we shall soon become objects of desire and
affection to the very persons who have the benefit of our correction; and
what is more than all, we shall enjoy those good things which are laid up in
store. Which God grant that we may all obtain, by the grace and mercy of
our Lord Jesus Christ; through whom and with whom, to the Father with
the Holy Ghost, be glory and power and honor, both now and always, and
forever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 2

Spoken in Antioch in the Old Church, as it was called, while he was
a presbyter, on the subject of the calamity that had befallen the city
in consequence of the tumult connected with the overthrow of the
Statues of the Emperor Theodosius, the Great and Pious. And on
the saying of the Apostle, "Charge them that are rich that they be
not high-minded," 1 Timothy 6:17. And against covetousness.

1. WHAT shall I say, or what shall I speak of? The present season is one
for tears, and not for words; for lamentation, not for discourse; for prayer,
not for preaching. Such is the magnitude of the deeds daringly done; so
incurable is the wound, so deep the blow, even beyond the power of all
treatment, and craving assistance from above. Thus it was that Job, when
he had lost all, sat himself down upon a dunghill; and his friends heard of
it, and came, and seeing him, while yet afar off, they rent their garments,
and sprinkled themselves with ashes, and made great lamentation. The
same thing now ought all the cities around to do, to come to our city and
to lament with all sympathy what has befallen us. He then sat down on
his dunghill; she is now seated in the midst of a great snare. For even as the
devil then leaped violently the flocks, and herds, and all the substance of
the just man, so now hath he raged against this whole city. But then, as
well as now, God permitted it; then, indeed, that he might make the just
man more illustrious by the greatness of his trials; and now, that he may
make us more sober-minded by the extremity of this tribulation. Suffer me
to mourn over our present state. We have been silent seven days, even as
the friends of Job were. Suffer me to open my mouth today, and to bewail
this common calamity.

2. Who, beloved, hath bewitched us? Who hath envied us? Whence hath all
this change come over us? Nothing was more dignified than our city! Now,
never was anything more pitiable! The populace so well ordered and quiet,
yea, even like a tractable and well tamed steed, always submissive to the
hands of its rulers, hath now so suddenly started off with us, as to have
wrought such evils, as one can hardly dare to mention.

I mourn now and lament, not for the greatness of that wrath which is to be
expected, but for the extravagance of the frenzy which has been
manifested! For although the Emperor should not be provoked, or in anger,
although he were neither to punish, nor take vengeance; how, I pray, are
we to bear the shame of all that has been done? I find the word of
instruction broken off by lamentation; scarcely am I able to open my
mouth, to part my lips, to move my tongue, or to utter a syllable! So, even
like a curb, the weight of grief checks my tongue, and keeps back what I
would say.

3. Aforetime there was nothing happier than our city; nothing more
melancholy than it is now become. As bees buzzing around their hive, so
before this the inhabitants every day flitted about the forum, and all
pronounced us happy in being so numerous. But behold now, this hive
hath become solitary! For even as smoke does those bees, so fear hath
driven away our swarms; and what the prophet says, bewailing Jerusalem,
we may fitly say now, "Our city is become ‘like a terebinth that hath lost
its leaves, and as a garden that hath no water.'" For in like manner as a
garden when its irrigation fails, exhibits the trees stripped of their leaves,
and bare of their fruits, so has it now fared with our city. For the help
from above having forsaken her, she stands desolate stripped of almost all
her inhabitants.

4. Nothing is sweeter than one's own country; but now, it has come to
pass that nothing is more bitter! All flee from the place which brought
them forth, as from a snare. They desert it as they would a dungeon; they
leap out of it, as from a fire. And just as when a house is seized upon by
the flames, not only those who dwell therein, but all who are near, take
their flight from it with the utmost haste, eager to save but their bare
bodies; even so now too, when the wrath of the Emperor is expected to
come as a fire from above, every one presses to go forth in time, and to
save the bare body, before the fire in its progress reaches them. And now
our calamity has become an enigma; a flight without enemies; an expulsion
of inhabitants without a battle; a captivity without capture! We have not
seen the fire of barbarians, nor beheld the face of enemies: and yet we
experience the sufferings of captives. All men now hear of our calamities;
for receiving our exiles, they learn from them the stroke which has fallen
upon our city.

5. Yet I am not ashamed, nor blush at this. Let all men learn the sufferings
of the city, that, sympathizing with their mother, they may lift up their
united voice to God from the whole earth; and with one consent entreat
the King of heaven for their universal nurse and parent. Lately our city
was shaken; but now the very souls of the inhabitants totter! Then the
foundations of the houses shook, but now the very foundations of every
heart quiver; and we all see death daily before our eyes! We live in
constant terror, and endure the penalty of Cain; a more pitiable one than
that of those who were the former inmates of the prison; undergoing as we
now do a new and strange kind of siege, far more terrible than the ordinary
kind. For they who suffer this from enemies, are only shut up within the
walls; but even the forum has become impassable to us, and every one is
pent up within the walls of his own house! And as it is not safe for those
who are besieged to go beyond the walls, while the enemy without is
encamped around; so neither, to many of those who inhabit this city, is it
safe to go out of doors, or to all-pear openly; on account of those who are
everywhere hunting for the innocent as well as the guilty; and seizing them
even in the midst of the forum, and dragging them to the court of justice,
without ceremony, and just as chance directs. For this reason, free-men sit
in doors shackled up with their domestics; anxiously and minutely
enquiring of those to whom they may safely put the question, "Who has
been seized today;" who carried off; or punished? How was it? and in
what manner?" They live a life more wretched than any kind of death;
being compelled daily to mourn the calamities of others; while they
tremble for their own safety, and are in no better case than the dead;
inasmuch as they are already dead with fear.

6. But if any one who is devoid of this fear and anguish, chooses to enter
the forum, he is presently driven back to his own dwelling, by the
cheerless spectacle; finding hardly perchance one or two people, and those
hanging their heads and creeping about with downcast looks, where but a
few days before the multitude swept along more incessantly than the
streams of rivers. Yet all these have now been driven away from us! And,
as when many trees in a thick wood of oak are cut down in all directions,
the spectacle becomes a melancholy one, even like that of a head with
many patches of baldness; even so the city itself, its inhabitants being
diminished and but few appearing here and there, is now become dreary,

and sheds a heavy mist of sorrow over those who witness it. And not the
ground only, but the very nature of the air, and even the circle of the sun's
beams, seem now to me to look mournful, and to shine more dimly; not
that the elements change their nature, but that our eyes being confused by
the cloud of sadness, are unable to receive the light of the rays clearly, or
with the same relish. This is what the prophet of old bewailed, when he
said, "The sun shall go down at noon, and the day shall be darkened." And
this he said, not as though the Day Star should be eclipsed, or the day
should disappear, but because those who are in sorrow, are not able to
perceive the light even of noon day on account of the darkness of their
anguish; which indeed has been the case now. And wherever any one looks
abroad, whether upon the ground or upon the walls; whether upon the
columns of the city, or upon his neighbors, he seems to see night and deep
gloom; so full is all of melancholy! There is a silence big with horror, and
loneliness everywhere; and that dear hum of the multitude is stifled; and
even as though all were gone beneath the earth, so speechlessness hath
now taken possession of the city; and all men seem like stones, and being
oppressed by the calamity like a gag on their tongues; they maintain the
profoundest silence, yea, such a silence as if enemies had come on them,
and had consumed them all at once by fire and sword!

7. Now is it a fit season to say, "Call for the mourning women, that they
may come, and for the cunning women, and let them take up a wailing. Let
your eyes run down with water, and your eyelids gush out with tears." Ye
hills take up wailing, and ye mountains lamentation! Let us call the whole
creation into sympathy with our evils. So great a City, and the head of
those which lie under the eastern sky, is in danger of being torn away from
the midst of the civilized world! She that had so many children, has now
suddenly become childless, and there is no one who shall come to her aid!
For he who has been insulted has not an equal in dignity upon earth; for he
is a monarch; the summit and head of all here below! On this account then
let us take refuge in the King that is above. Him let us call in to our aid. If
we may not obtain the favor of heaven, there is no consolation left for
what has befallen us!

8. Here I could wish to end this discourse; for the minds of those who are
in anguish are indisposed to extend their discourses to a great length. And
as when some dense cloud has formed, and flying under the solar rays,

returns back to him all his splendor again, so indeed does the cloud of
sadness, when it stands before our souls, refuse to admit an easy passage
for the word, but chokes it and restrains it forcibly within. And this is the
case not only with those who speak, but with those who hear; for as it
does not suffer the word to burst forth freely from the soul of the speaker,
so neither does it suffer it to sink into the mind of those who listen, with
its natural power. Therefore also the Jews of old time, while slaving at the
mud and bricks, had not the heart to listen to Moses, while he repeatedly
told them great things respecting their future deliverance; despondency
making their minds inaccessible to the address, and shutting up their sense
of hearing. I could have wished then, as to myself, to have put an end here
to my discourse; but thinking that it is not only the nature of a cloud to
intercept the forward passage of the sun's rays, but that often just the
opposite happens to the cloud; since the sun continually falling upon it
with much warmth, wears it away, and frequently breaks through the
midst of it; and shining forth all at once, meets cheerfully the gaze of the
beholders. This also I myself expect to do this day; and the word being
continually associated with your minds, and dwelling in them, I hope to
burst the cloud of sadness, and to shine through your understandings
again, with the customary instruction!

9. But afford me your attention! Lend me your ears awhile! Shake off this
despondency! Let us return to our former custom; and as we have been
used always to meet here with gladness, so let us also do now, casting all
upon God. And this will contribute towards our actual deliverance from
calamity. For should the Lord see that His words are listened to carefully;
and that our love of divine wisdom stands the trial of the difficulty of
these times, He will quickly take us up again, and will make out of the
present tempest a calm and happy change. For this too is a thing in which
it behooves the Christian to differ from the unbelievers, the bearing all
things nobly; and through hope of the future, soaring above the attack of
human evils. The believer hath his stand on the Rock; for this reason he
cannot be overthrown by the dashing of the billows. For should the waves
of temptation rise, they cannot reach to his feet. He stands too lofty for
any such assault. Let us not then sink down, beloved! We do not care so
much for our own safety, as God who made us. There is not so much
solicitude on our part, lest we suffer any dreadful misfortune, as with Him

who bestowed upon us a soul, and then gave us so many good things
beside. Let us mount on the wings of these hopes, and hear the things
about to be spoken with our accustomed readiness.

10. I made a prolonged discourse lately unto you beloved, and yet I saw all
following it up, and no one turning back in the middle of the course. I
return thanks to you for that readiness, and have received the reward of
my labors. But there was another reward, besides that attention, which I
asked of you at that time; perchance you know and recollect it. And what
was the reward? That you should punish and chastise the blasphemers
that were in the city; that ye should restrain those who are violent and
insolent against God! I do not think that I then spoke these things of
myself; but that God, foreseeing what was coming, injected these words
into my mind; for if we had punished those who dared to do such things,
that which has now happened would never have happened. How much
better would it have been, if necessity so required, to run into danger; yea,
to suffer in castigating and correcting such persons (which would have
brought us a martyr's crown), than now to fear, to tremble, and to expect
death, from the insubordination of such persons! Behold, the crime was
that of a few, but the blame comes on all! Behold, through these, we are all
now placed in fear, and are ourselves suffering the punishment of what
these men dared to do! But if we had taken them in time, and cast them
out of the city, and chastised them, and corrected the sick member, we
should not have been subjected to our present terror. I know that the
manners of this city have been of a noble character from old times; but that
certain strangers, and men of mixed race, - accursed and pernicious
characters, - hopeless of their own safety, have perpetrated what has
been perpetrated. For this very reason I was always lifting up my voice,
and unceasingly bearing my testimony, saying, Let us punish the madness
of those blasphemers, - let us control their spirit, and provide for their
salvation; - yea, though it be necessary to die in doing it, the deed would
yet bring us great gain: let us not overlook the insult done to our common
Lord; overlooking such things will bring forth some great evil to our city!

11. These things I foretold, and they have now actually taken place; -
and we are paying the penalty of that listlessness! You overlooked the
insult that was done unto God! - Behold, he hath permitted the Emperor
to be insulted, and peril to the utmost to hang over all, in order that we

might pay by this fear the penalty of that listlessness; was it then vainly,
and to no purpose I foretold these things, and assiduously urged your
Charity? But nevertheless, nothing was done. Let it, however, be done
now; and being chastened by our present calamity, let us now restrain the
disorderly madness of these men. Let us shut up their mouths, even as we
close up pestiferous fountains; and let us turn them to a contrary course,
and the evils which have taken hold of the city shall undoubtedly be
stayed. The Church is not a theater, that we should listen for amusement.
With profit ought we to depart hence, and some fresh and great gain
should we acquire ere we leave this place. For it is but vainly and
irrationally we meet together, if we have been but captivated for a time,
and return home empty, and void of all improvement from the things
spoken.

12. What need have I of these plaudits, these cheers and tumultuous signs
of approval? The praise I seek, is that ye show forth all I have said in your
works. Then am I an enviable and happy man, not when ye approve, but
when ye perform with all readiness, whatsoever ye hear from me? Let
every one then correct his neighbor, for "edify ye one another," it is said,
and if we do not this, the crimes of each one will bring some general and
intolerable damage to the city. Behold, while we are unconscious of any
part in this transaction, we are no less affrighted than those who were
daringly engaged in it! We are dreading lest the wrath of the Emperor
should descend upon all; and it is not sufficient for us to say in defense, "I
was not present; I was not an accomplice, nor a participator in these acts."
"For this reason," he may reply, "thou shalt be punished, and pay the
extreme penalty, because thou wert not present; and didst not check, nor
restrain the rioters, and didst not run any risk for the honor of the
Emperor! Hadst thou no part in these audacious deeds? I commend this,
and take it well. But thou didst not check these things when being done.
This is a cause of accusation!" Such words. as these, we shall also hear
from God, if we silently suffer the continuance of the injuries and insults
committed against Him. For he also who had buried his talent in the earth,
was called to account, not for crimes done by himself, for he had given
back the whole of that which was entrusted to him, but because he had not
increased it; because he had not instructed others; because he had not
deposited it in the hands of the bankers; that is, he had not admonished, or

counseled, or rebuked, or amended those unruly sinners who were his
neighbors. On this account he was sent away without reprieve to those
intolerable punishments! But I fully trust that though ye did not before,
ye will now at least perform this work of correction, and not overlook
insult committed against God. For the events which have taken place are
sufficient, even if no one had given any warning, to convince men ever so
disposed to be insensible, that they must exert themselves for their own
safety.

13. But it is now time that we should proceed to lay out before you the
customary table from St. Paul, by handling the subject of this day's
reading, and placing it in view for you all. What then was the text read
today? "Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not
high-minded." When he says, "the rich in this world," he makes it
manifest, that there are others who are rich, that is, in the world to come:
such as was that Lazarus, poor as to the present life, but rich as to the
future; not in gold and silver, and such like perishable and transitory store
of wealth; but in those unutterable good things "which eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man." For this is true
wealth and opulence, when there is good unmixed, and not subject to any
change. Not such was the case of that rich man who despised him, but he
became the poorest of mankind. Afterwards at least when he sought to
obtain but a drop of water, he did not get possession even of that, to such
extreme poverty was he come. For this reason he calls them rich "in the
present world," to teach thee that along with the present life, worldly
wealth is annihilated. It goes no further, neither does it change its place
with its migrating possessors, but it often leaves them before their end;
which therefore he shows by saying, "Neither trust in uncertain riches;"
for nothing is so faithless as wealth; of which I have often said, and will
not cease to say, that it is a runaway, thankless servant, having no fidelity;
and should you throw over him ten thousand chains, he will make off
dragging his chains after him. Frequently, indeed, have those who
possessed him shut him up with bars and doors, placing their slaves round
about for guards. But he has over-persuaded these very servants, and has
fled away together with his guards; dragging his keepers after him like a
chain, so little security was there in this custody. What then can be more
faithless than this? what more wretched than men devoted to it? When

men endeavor with all eagerness to collect so frail and fleeting a thing, they
do not hear what the prophet saith: "Woe unto them who trust in their
power, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches." Tell me why
is this woe pronounced? - "He heapeth up treasure," saith he, "and
knoweth not for whom he will gather it," - forasmuch as the labor is
certain, but the enjoyment uncertain. Very often you toil and endure
trouble for enemies. The inheritance of your wealth after your decease,
coming as it does, in many instances, to those who have injured you, and
plotted against you in a thousand ways, has assigned you the sins for your
part, but the enjoyment to others!

14. But here, it is worthy of enquiry, for what reason he does not say,
"Charge those who are rich in the present world, not to be rich; charge
them to become poor; charge them to get rid of what they have;" but,
"charge them, not to be high-minded." For he knew that the root and
foundation of riches is pride; and that if any man understood how to be
unassuming, he would not make much ado about the matter. Tell me,
indeed, for what reason thou leadest about so many servants, parasites,
and flatterers, and all the other forms of pomp? Not for necessity, but
only for pride; to the end that by these thou mayest seem more dignified
than other men! Besides, he knew that wealth is not forbidden if it be used
for that which is necessary. For as I observed, wine is not a bad thing, but
drunkenness is so. A covetous man is one thing, and a rich man is another
thing. The covetous man is not rich; he is in want of many things, and
while he needs many things, he can never be rich. The covetous man is a
keeper, not a master, of wealth; a slave, not a Lord. For he would sooner
give any one a portion of his flesh, than his buried gold. And as though he
were ordered and compelled of some one to touch nothing of these hidden
treasures, so with all earnestness he watches and keeps them, abstaining
from his own, as if it were another's. And certainly, they are not his own.
For what he can neither determine to bestow upon others, nor to distribute
to the necessitous, although he may sustain infinite punishments, how can
he possibly account his own? How does he hold possession of those
things, of which he has neither the free use, nor enjoyment? But besides
this, - Paul is not accustomed to enjoin everything on every man, but
accommodates himself to the weakness of his hearers, even, indeed, as
Christ also did. For when that rich man came to him, and asked him

concerning Life, he did not say at one, "Go, sell that thou hast," but
omitting this, he spoke to him of other commandments. Nor afterwards,
when he challenged' Him and said, "What lack I yet?" did He simply say,
"Sell what thou hast;" but, "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou
hast." "I lay it down for your determination. I give you full power to
choose. I do not lay upon you any necessity." For this reason also, Paul
spoke nothing to the rich concerning poverty, but concerning humility; as
well because of the weakness of his hearers, as because he perfectly knew,
that could he bring them to exercise moderation, and to be free from pride,
he should also quickly free them from eagerness about being rich.

15. And further, after giving this admonition, "not to be high-minded," he
also taught the manner in which they would be able to avoid being so. And
how was it? That they should consider the nature of wealth, how
uncertain and faithless it is! therefore he goes on to say, "Neither trust in
uncertain riches." The rich man is not one who is in possession of much,
but one who gives much. Abraham was rich, but he was not covetous; for
he turned not his thoughts to the house of this man, nor prayed into the
wealth of that man; but going forth he looked around wherever there
chanced to be a stranger, or a poor man, in order that he might succor
poverty, and hospitably entertain the traveler. He covered not his roof
with gold, but fixing his tent near the oak, he was contented with the
shadow of its leaves. Yet so illustrious was his lodging, that angels were
not ashamed to tarry with him; for they sought not splendor of abode, but
virtue of soul. This man then let us imitate, beloved, and bestow what we
have upon the needy. That lodging was rudely prepared, but it was more
illustrious than the halls of kings. No king has ever entertained angels; but
he, dwelling under that oak, and having but pitched a tent, was thought
worthy of that honor: not receiving the honor on account of the meanness
of his dwelling, but enjoying that benefit on account of the magnificence of
his soul, and the wealth therein deposited.

16. Let us too, then, adorn not our houses, but our souls in preference to
the house. For is it not disgraceful to clothe our walls with marble, vainly
and to no end, and to neglect Christ going about naked? What does thy
house profit thee, O man! For wilt thou take it with thee when thou
departest? This thou canst not take with thee, when thou departest. But
thy soul, when thou departest, thou shall assuredly take with thee! Behold

now this great danger has overtaken us! Let your houses stand by you!
Let them deliver you from the threatened peril! but they cannot! And ye
yourselves are witnesses, who are leaving them solitary, and hurrying
forth to the wilderness; fearing them as ye would do snares and nets! Let
riches now lend assistance! But it is no time for them to do so! If then the
power of riches is found wanting before the wrath of man, much rather
will this be the case, before the divine and inexorable tribunal! If it is but a
man that is provoked and offended, and even now gold is of no avail, much
more will the power of money be utterly impotent then, when God is
angry, who has no need of wealth! We build houses that we may have a
habitation; not that we may make an ambitious display. What is beyond
our wants, is superfluous and useless. Put on a sandal which is larger than
your foot! you will not endure it; for it is a hindrance to the step. Thus
also a house larger than necessity requires, is an impediment to your
progress towards heaven. Do you wish to build large and splendid houses?
I forbid it not; but let it be not upon the earth! Build thyself tabernacles in
heaven, and such that thou mayest be able to receive others; - tabernacles
which never fall to pieces. Why art thou mad about fleeting things; and
things that must be left here? Nothing is more slippery than wealth.
Today it is for thee; tomorrow it is against thee. It arms the eyes of the
envious everywhere. It is a hostile comrade, a domestic enemy; and ye are
witnesses of this, who possess it, and are in every way burying and
concealing it from view; as even now too our very wealth makes the danger
more insupportable to us! Thou seest indeed the poor ready for action,
disengaged, and prepared for all things; but the wealthy in great perplexity,
and wandering about, seeking where they may bury their gold, or seeking
with whom they may deposit it! Why, O man, dost thou seek thy fellow
slaves? Christ stands ready to receive, and to keep thy deposits for thee;
and not to keep only, but also to augment them, and to pay them back
with much interest. Out of His hand no man can forcibly take them away.
And He not only keeps the deposit, but for this very thing He also frees
thee from thy perils. For among men, they who receive treasures in trust
think that they have done us a favor, in keeping that of which they took
charge; but with Christ it is the contrary; for He does not say that He has
conferred, but that He has received a favor, when He receives thy
deposited treasures; and for the guardianship which He exercises over thy

wealth, He does not demand a recompense of thee, but gives thee a
recompense!

17. What defense then can we claim, or what excuse, when we pass by
Him who is able to keep, and who is thankful for the trust giving in return
great and unspeakable rewards, and in place of this guardianship commit
our treasures to men who have not the power to keep them, and who think
they grant us a favor, and pay us back at last only that which was given
them. Thou art a stranger and a pilgrim with respect to the things here!
Thou hast a country which is thine own in the heavens! There transfer all;
- that before the actual enjoyment, thou mayest enjoy the recompense
here. He who is nourished with good hopes, and is confident respecting
things to come, hath here already tasted of the kingdom! For nothing
ordinarily so repairs the soul, and makes a man better, as a good hope of
things to come; so that if thou transfer thy wealth there, thou mayest then
provide for thy soul with suitable leisure. For they who spend all their
endeavors upon the decoration of their dwelling, rich as they are in
outward things, are careless of that which is within, letting their soul abide
desolate and squalid, and full of cobwebs. But if they would be indifferent
to exterior things, and earnestly expend all their attention upon the mind,
adorning this at all points; then the soul of such men would be a resting
place for Christ. And having Christ for its inhabitant, what could ever be
more blessed? Wouldest thou be rich? Have God for thy friend, and thou
shall be richer than all men! - Wouldest thou be rich? Be not
high-minded! - This rule is suitable not only to things future, but to
things present. For there is no such object of envy, as a man of wealth; but
when pride is super-added, a two-fold precipice is formed; the war
becomes fiercer on all sides. But if you know how to exercise moderation,
you undermine the tyranny of envy by your humility; and you possess
whatever you do possess with safety. For such is the nature of virtue, that
it not only profits us, as it respects futurity, but it also here bestows a
present reward.

18. Let us not then be high-minded in reference to riches, or indeed to any
other thing; for if even in spiritual things the man who is high-minded is
fallen, and undone, much more so as to carnal things. Let us be mindful of
our nature. Let us recollect our sins. Let us understand what we are; and
this will provide a sufficient groundwork for complete humility. Tell me

not, "I have laid up the revenues of this or that number of years; myriads
of talents of gold; gains that are increasing every day." Say as much as you
will, you say all in vain, and to no purpose. Very often in one hour, yea, in
one short moment, just as the light dust, when the wind rushes down upon
it from above, are all these things swept out of the house by a blast. Our
life is full of such examples, and the Scriptures abound with lessons of this
sort. He who is rich today, is poor tomorrow. Wherefore, I have often
smiled, when reading wills that said, let such a man have the ownership of
these fields, or of this house, and another the use thereof. For we all have
the use, but no man has the ownership. For although riches may remain
with us all our lifetime, undergoing no change, we must transfer them in
the end, whether we will or no, into the hands of others; having enjoyed
only the use of them, and departing to another life naked and destitute of
this ownership! Whence it is plain, that they only have the ownership of
property, who have despised its use, and derided its enjoyment. For the
man that has cast his substance away from him, and bestowed it on the
poor, he uses it as he ought; and takes with him the ownership of these
things when he departs, not being stripped of the possession even in
death, but at that time receiving all back again; yea, and much more than
these things, at that day of judgment, when he most needs their protection,
and when we shall all have to render up an account of the deeds we have
done. So that if any one wishes to have the possession of his riches, and
the use and the ownership entire, let him disencumber himself from them
all; since, truly, he who doth not this must at all events be separated from
them at death; and frequently before his death will lose them, in the midst
of dangers and innumerable ills.

19. And this is not the only disaster, that the change comes suddenly; but
that the rich man comes unpracticed to the endurance of poverty. But not
so the poor man; for he confides not in gold and silver, which are lifeless
matter, but in "God, who giveth us all things richly to enjoy." So that the
rich man stands in more uncertainty than the poor man, experiencing, as he
does, frequent and diversified changes. What is the sense of this? "Who
giveth to us all things richly to enjoy." God giveth all those things with
liberality, which are more necessary than riches; such, for example, as the
air, the water, the fire, the sun; all things of this kind. The rich man is not
able to say that he enjoys more of the sunbeams than the poor man; he is

not able to say that he breathes more plenteous air: but all these are
offered alike to all. And wherefore, one may say, is it the greater and more
necessary blessings, and those which maintain our life, that God hath made
common; but the smaller and less valuable (I speak of money) are not thus
common. Why is this? In order thatour life might be disciplined, and that
we might have training ground for virtue. For if these necessaries were not
common, perhaps they who are rich, practicing their usual covetousness,
would strangle those who were poor. For if they do this for the sake of
money, much rather would they do so for the things referred to. Again, if
money was also an universal possession, and were offered in the same
manner to all, the occasion for almsgiving, and the opportunity for
benevolence, would be taken away.

20. That we may live then securely, the sources of our existence have been
made common. On the other hand, to the end that we may have an
opportunity of gaining crowns and good report, property has not been
made common; in order that hating covetousness, and following after
righteousness, and freely bestowing our goods upon the poor, we may by
this method obtain a certain kind of relief for our sins. God hath made thee
rich, why makest thou thyself poor? He hath made thee rich that thou
mayest assist the needy; that thou mayest have release of thine own sins,
by liberality to others. He hath given thee money, not that thou mayest
shut it up for thy destruction, but that thou mayest pour it forth for thy
salvation. For this reason also He hath made the possession of riches
uncertain and unstable, that by this means he might slack the intensity of
thy madness concerning it. For if its possessors, even now whilst they can
have no confidence in regard to it, but behold a multitude of snares
produced from this quarter, are so inflamed with the desire of these things;
if the elements of security and stability were added to wealth, whom
would they have spared? From whom would they have refrained? From
what widows? From what orphans? From what poor?

21. Wherefore let us not consider riches to be a great good; for the great
good is, not to possess money, but to possess the fear of God and all
manner of piety. Behold, now if there were any righteous man here, having
great boldness toward God, notwithstanding he might be the poorest of
mortals, he would be sufficient to liberate us from present evils! For he
only needed to spread forth his hands towards heaven, and to call upon

God, and this cloud would pass away! But now gold is treasured up in
abundance; and yet it is more useless than mere clay for the purpose of
deliverance from the impending calamities! Nor is it only in a peril of this
kind; but should disease or death, or any such evil befall us, the impotency
of wealth is fully proved, since it is at a loss, and has no consolation of its
own to offer us amidst these events.

22. There is one thing in which wealth seems to have an advantage over
poverty, viz. that it lives in a state of daily luxury, and is supplied with an
abundance of pleasure in its banquets. This however may also be seen
exemplified at the table of the poor; and these enjoy there a pleasure
superior to that of the rich. And marvel not at this, nor think what I say a
paradox; for I will make the matter clear to you from the evidence of facts.
Ye know of course, and ye all confess that in feasts it is not the nature of
the viands, but the disposition of those who feast upon them, which
usually causes the pleasure; for instance, when any one comes to the table
hungry, the food will taste sweeter than any delicacy, or condiment, or a
thousand exquisite preparations for the palate, although it may be the
most common article of diet. But he who without tarrying for necessity, or
first waiting till he is hungry, (as the custom is with the wealthy), when he
comes to the table, notwithstanding he finds the most refined dainties
spread before him, has no sensation of pleasure, his appetite not being
previously excited. And that you may learn that this is the actual state of
the case, besides that you are all witnesses to it, let us hear the Scripture
telling us the same truth; "The full soul," it is said, "loaths the honey
comb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet." Yet what can be
sweeter than honey, and the honey comb? Still he saith it is not sweet to
the man that is not hungry. And what can be more disagreeable than bitter
things? And yet to those who are poverty stricken they are sweet. But
that the poor come to the meal with need and hunger, and that the rich do
not wait for this is manifest, I suppose, to every one. Hence they do not
reap the fruit of a genuine and unmixed pleasure. Nor is it only in the
article of food, but any one may perceive that the same thing occurs with
respect to drinks; and as in the one case hunger is the cause of pleasure, far
more than the quality of the viands, so also in the other, thirst usually
makes the draught sweetest, although what is drunk is only water. And
this is that which the prophet intimated, when he said, "He Satisfied them

with honey out of the rock." But we do not read in any part of Scripture
that Moses brought honey out of the rock, but throughout the history we
read of rivers, and waters, and cool streams. What then is it that was
meant? For the Scripture by no means speaks falsely. Inasmuch, then, as
they were thirsty and wearied with drought, and found these streams of
water so cooling, in order to show the pleasure of such a draught, he calls
the water honey, not as though its nature were changed into honey, but
because the condition of the drinkers made these streams sweeter than
honey. You see how the condition of the thirsty is wont to make the
draught sweet? Yea oftentimes have many of the poor, when wearied, and
distressed, and parched with thirst, partaken of such streams even with
such pleasure as I have said. But the rich, whilst drinking wine that is
sweet, and has the fragrance of flowers? and every perfection that wine
can have, experience no such enjoyment.

23. The same thing happens as every one may perceive with regard to
sleep. For not a soft couch, nor a bedstead overlaid with silver, nor the
quietness that exists throughout the house, nor anything else of this kind,
are so generally wont to make sleep sweet and pleasant, as labor and
fatigue, and the need of sleep, and drowsiness when one lies down. And to
this particular the experience of facts, nay, before actual experience, the
assertion of the Scriptures bears witness. For Solomon, who had passed
his life in luxury, when he wished to make this matter evident, said, "The
sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much?" Why does
he add, "whether he eat little or much?" Both these things usually bring
sleeplessness, viz. indigence, and excess of food; the one drying up the
body, stiffening the eyelids and not suffering them to be closed; the other
straitening and oppressing the breath, and inducing many pains. But at the
same time so powerful a persuasive is labor, that though both these things
should befall him, the servant is able to sleep. For since throughout the
whole day, they are running about everywhere, ministering to their
masters, being knocked about and hard pressed, and having but little time
to take breath, they receive a sufficient recompense for their toils and
labors in the pleasure of sleeping. And thus it hath happened through the
goodness of God toward man, that these pleasures are not to be purchased
with gold and silver, but with labor, with hard toil, with necessity, and
every kind of discipline. Not so the rich. On the contrary, whilst lying on

their beds, they are frequently without sleep through the whole night; and
though they devise many schemes, they do not obtain such pleasure. But
the poor man when released from his daily labors, having his limbs
completely tired, falls almost before he can lie down into a slumber that is
sound, and sweet, and genuine, enjoying this reward, which is not a small
one, of his fair day's toils. Since therefore the poor man sleeps, and drinks,
and eats with more pleasure than the rich man, what further value is left to
riches, now deprived of the one advantage they seemed to have over
poverty? For this reason also, from the beginning, God tied the man to
labor, not for the purpose of punishing or chastising, but for amendment
and education. When Adam lived an unlaborious life, he fell from Paradise,
but when the Apostle labored abundantly, and toiled hard, and said, "In
labor and travail working night and day," then he was taken up into
Paradise, and ascended to the third heaven!

24. Let us not then despise labor; let us not despise work; for before the
kingdom of Heaven, we receive the greatest recompense from thence,
deriving pleasure from that circumstance; and not pleasure only, but what
is greater than pleasure, the purest health. For in addition to their want of
relish, many diseases also attack the rich; but the poor are freed from the
hands of physicians; and if at times they do fall into a sickness, they
recover themselves quickly, being far removed from all effeminacy, and
having robust constitutions. Poverty, to those who bear it wisely, is a
great possession, a treasure that cannot be taken away; the stoutest of
staves; a way of gain that cannot be thwarted; a lodging that is safe from
snares. The poor man, it may be objected, is oppressed. But then the rich
man is still more subject to adverse designs. The poor man is looked down
upon and insulted. But the rich man is the subject of envy. The poor man
is not so easily assailed as the rich man, offering, as the latter does on
every side, countless handles to the devil, and to his secret foes; and being
the servant of all, on account of the great extent of his business. Standing
in need of many things, he is compelled to flatter many persons, and to
minister to them with much servility. But the poor man, if he knows how
to be spiritually wise, is not assailable even by the devil himself. Job
therefore, strong as he was before this, when he lost all, became still more
powerful, and bore away an illustrious victory from the devil!

25. But besides this, the poor man cannot possibly be injured, if he knows
how to be spiritually wise. Now what I said of pleasure, that it consisted
not in a costly provision of meats, but in the disposition of those who eat,
this also I say respecting an insult; that the insult is either created or
destroyed, not by the intention of those who insult, but by the disposition
of those who bear it. For example. Some one hath insulted thee with much
language, fit or unfit to repeat. If thou shall laugh at the insults, if thou
take not the words to heart, if thou showest thyself superior to the blow,
thou art not insulted. And just as if we possessed an adamantine body, we
should not be hurt, were we even attacked on all sides by a thousand darts,
for darts beget wounds not from the hand of him who hurls them, but from
the bodies of those who receive them, so too in this case, insults are
constituted real and dishonorable ones, not from the folly of those who
offer them, but from the weakness of the insulted. For if we know how to
be truly wise, we are incapable of being insulted, or of suffering any
serious evils. Some one it may be hath offered thee an insult, but thou hast
not felt it? thou hast not been pained. Then thou art not insulted, but hast
given rather than received a blow! For when the insulting person perceives
that his blow did not reach the soul of those who were reviled, he is
himself the more severely fretted; and whilst those who are reproached
remain silent, the insulting blow is turned backwards, and recoils of its
own accord upon him who aimed it.

26. In all things then, beloved, let us be spiritually wise, and poverty will
be able to do us no harm, but will benefit us exceedingly, and render us
more illustrious and wealthy than the richest. For tell me who was poorer
than Elias? Yet for this reason he surpassed all the wealthy, in that he was
so poor, and this very poverty of his was his own choice from an
opulence of mind. For since he accounted the wealth of all riches to be
beneath his magnanimity, and not worthy of his spiritual wisdom,
therefore he welcomed this kind of poverty; so that if he had considered
present things as of much worth, he would not have possessed only a
mantle. But so did he contemn the vanity of the life that now is, and regard
all gold as clay east into the street, that he possessed himself of nothing
more than that covering. Therefore the king had need of the poor man, and
he who had so much gold hung upon the words of him who had nothing
more than a sheepskin. Thus was the sheepskinmore splendid than the

purple, and the cave of the just man than the halls of kings. Therefore also
when he went up to heaven, he left nothing to his disciple save the
sheepskin. "By the help of this," said he, "I have wrestled with the devil,
and taking this, be thou armed against him!" For indigence is a powerful
weapon, an unassailable retreat, an unshaken fortress! Elisha received the
sheepskin as the greatest inheritance; for it was truly such; a more
precious one than all gold. And thenceforth that Elias was a twofold
person; an Elias above and an Elias below! I know ye account that just
person blessed, and ye would each desire to be that person. What then if I
show you that all among us, who are initiated, have received something far
greater than he did? For Elias left a sheepskin to his disciple, but the Son
of God ascending left to us His own flesh! Elias indeed, cast off his
mantle, before he went up; but Christ left it behind for our sakes; and yet
retained it when He ascended. Let us not then be cast down. Let us not
lament, nor fear the difficulty of the times, for He who did not refuse to
pour out His blood for all, and has suffered us to partake of His flesh and
of His blood again, what will He refuse to do for our safety? Confident
then in these hopes, let us beseech Him continually; let us be earnest in
prayers and supplications; and let us with all strictness give our attention
to every other virtue; that so we may escape the danger that now
threatens, and obtain the good things to come; which God grant we may all
be worthy of, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by Whom, and with Whom be glory to the Father together with the
Holy Ghost, forever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 3

On the departure of Flavian, Bishop of Antioch, who was gone on
an embassy to the Emperor Theodosius, on behalf of the city. Of the
dignity of the Priesthood. What is true fasting. Slander worse than
devouring the human body. And finally of those who had been put
to death on account of the sedition; and against those who
complained that many innocent persons were apprehended.

1. WHEN I took on that throne, deserted and bereft of our teacher, I rejoice
and weep at the same time. I weep, because I see not our father with us!
but I rejoice that he hath set out on a journey for our preservation; that he
is gone to snatch so great a multitude from the wrath of the Emperor! Here
is both an ornament to you, and a crown to him! An ornament to you, that
such a father hath been allotted to you; a crown to him, because he is so
affectionate towards his children, and hath confirmed by actual deeds what
Christ said. For having learnt that "the good shepherd layeth down his life
for the sheep," he took his departure; venturing his own life for us all,
notwithstanding there were many things to hinder his absence, and enforce
his stay. And first, his time of life, extended as it is to the utmost limits of
old age; next, his bodily infirmity, and the season of the year, as well as
the necessity for his presence at the holy festival; and besides these
reasons, his only sister even now at her last breath! He has disregarded,
however, the ties of kindred, of old age, of infirmity, and the severity of
the season, and the toils of the journey; and preferring you and your
safety above all things, he has broken through all these restraints. And,
even as a youth, the aged man is now hastening along, born upon the wings
of zeal! For if Christ (saith he) gave Himself for us, what excuse or pardon
should we deserve, having undertaken the charge of so numerous a people,
if we were not ready to do and to suffer anything for the security of those
committed into our hands. For if (continues he) the patriarch Jacob, when
in charge of flocks, and feeding brute sheep, and having to give account to
man, passed sleepless nights, and bore heat and cold, and all the
inclemency of the elements, to the end that not one of those animals might
perish, much less doth it become us, who preside over those, who are not
irrational, but spiritual sheep; who are about to give an account of this

charge, not to man, but to God, to be slack in any respect, or shrink from
anything which might benefit the flock. Besides, in proportion as the latter
flock is superior to the former; men to brutes, and God to men; so it
behooves us to manifest a greater and more intense anxiety and diligence.
He knows well that his concern is now, not for one city only, but for the
whole of the East. For our city is the head and mother of all that lie
towards the East. For this reason he would encounter every danger, and
nothing would avail to detain him here.

2. On this account I trust that there may be a good hope; for God will not
disdain to took upon such earnestness and zeal, nor will He suffer his
servant to return without success. I know that when he has barely seen
our pious Emperor, and been seen by him, he will be able at once by his
very countenance to allay his wrath. For not only the words of the saints,
but their very countenances are full of grace. And he is a person too
endowed with abundant wisdom; and being well skilled in the divine laws,
he will say to him as Moses said to God, "Yet now, if thou wilt forgive
their sin; - and if not, slay me together with them." For such are the
bowels of the saints, that they think death with their children sweeter than
life without them. He will also make the special season his advocate and
shelter himself behind the sacred festival of the Passover; and will remind
the Emperor of the season when Christ remitted the sins of the whole
world. He will exhort him to imitate his Lord. He will also remind him of
that parable of the ten thousand talents, and the hundred pence. I know
the boldness of our father, that he will not hesitate to alarm him from the
parable, and to say, "Take heed lest thou also hear it said in that day, ‘O
thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desirest me;
you ought also to forgive thy fellow-servants!' Thou dost to thyself a
greater benefit than them, since by pardoning these few offenses thou
gainest an amnesty for greater." To this address he will add that prayer,
which those who initiated him into the sacred mystery taught him to offer
up, and say, "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."

3. He will moreover inform him, that the offense was not common to the
whole city, but the deed of certain strangers and adventurers, men that act
upon no deliberate plan, but with every sort of audacity and lawlessness;
and that it would not be just for the disorderly conduct of a few to
extirpate so great a city, and to punish those who had done no wrong; and

that even though all had been transgressors, they had paid a sufficient
punishment, being consumed by fear so many days, and expecting every
day to be put to death, and being exiles and fugitives; thus living more
wretchedly than condemned criminals, carrying their life in their hands,
and having no confidence of escape! "Let this punishment (he will say)
suffice. Carry not thy resentment further! Make the Judge above merciful
to thyself, by humanity towards thy fellow-servants! Think of the
greatness of the city, and that the question now is not concerning one, or
two, or three, or ten souls, but of a vast multitude too numerous to be
reckoned up! It is a question which affects the capital of the whole world.
This is the city in which Christians were first called by that name. Honor
Christ. Reverence the city which first proclaimed that name, so lovely and
sweet to all! This city hath been the tabernacle of Apostles; the dwelling
place of the just! And now this is the first and only instance of
insurrection against its rulers; and all past time will bear favorable witness
to the manners of the city. For had the people been continually given to
sedition, it might have been necessary to make an example of such
iniquity; but if this hath happened only once in all time, it is plain that the
offense has not arisen from the habit of the city, but that it was the
transgression of those who had in an evil hour by mere random chance
arrived there.

4. These things and more than these the priest will say with still greater
boldness; and the Emperor will listen to them; and one is humane, and the
other is faithful; so that on both sides we entertain favorable hopes. But
much more do we rely upon the mercy of God, than upon the fidelity of
our Teacher and the humanity of the Emperor. For whilst the Emperor is
supplicated, and the priest is supplicating, He Himself will interpose,
softening the heart of the Emperor, and exciting the tongue of the priest;
facilitating his utterance; - preparing the mind of the other to receive
what is said and with much indulgence, to accede to the petitions. For our
city is dearer to Christ than all others both because of the virtue of our
ancestors, and of your own. And as Peter was the first among the apostles
to preach Christ, so as I said before, this city was the first of cities that
adorned itself by assuming the Christian appellation, as a sort of admirable
diadem. But if where only ten just men were found, God promised to save
all who dwelt therein, why should we not expect a favorable issue, and

become assured of all our lives, when there are not only ten, twenty, or
twice so many only, but far more; who are serving God with all strictness.

5. I have heard many saying, "The threats of a king are like the wrath of a
lion;" being full of dejection and lamentation. What then should we say to
such? That He who said, "The wolves and the lambs shall feed together;
and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the lion shall eat straw like
the ox," will be able to convert the lion into a mild lamb. Let us therefore
supplicate Him; let us send an embassy to Him; and He will doubtless
allay the Emperor's wrath, and deliver us from the impending distress.
Our Father hath gone thither on this embassy. Let us go on embassy from
hence to the Majesty of heaven! Let us assist him by prayers! The
community of the Church can do much, if with a sorrowful soul, and with
a contrite spirit, we offer up our prayers! It is unnecessary to cross the
ocean, or to undertake a long journey. Let every man and woman among
us, whether meeting together at church, or remaining at home, call upon
God with much earnestness, and He will doubtless accede to these
petitions.

Whence does this appear evident? Because He is exceedingly desirous, that
we should always take refuge in Him, and in everything make our requests
unto Him; and do nothing and speak nothing without Him. For men, when
we trouble them repeatedly concerning our affairs, become slothful and
evasive, and conduct themselves unpleasantly towards us; but with God it
is quite the reverse. Not when we apply to him continually respecting our
affairs, but when we fail to do so, then is he especially displeased. Hear at
least what He reproves the Jews for, when He says, "Ye have taken
counsel, but not of Me, and made treaties, but not by My Spirit." For this
is the custom of those who love; they desire that all the concerns of their
beloved should be accomplished by means of themselves; and that they
should neither do anything, nor say anything, without them. On this
account did God not only on that occasion, but again elsewhere, uttering a
reproof, speak the same language. "They have reigned, but not by Me;
they have ruled, and they made it not known to Me." Let us not then be
slow to take refuge in Him continually: and whatever be the evil, it will in
any case find its appropriate solution.

6. Doth a man affright you? Hasten to the Lord above, and thou wilt suffer
no evil. Thus the ancients had release from their calamities; and not men
only, but also women. There was a certain Hebrew woman, Esther was her
name. This Esther rescued the whole people of the Jews, when they were
about to be delivered over to destruction, by this very method. For when
the Persian king gave orders that all the Jews should be utterly destroyed,
and there was no one who was able to stand in the way of his wrath, this
woman having divested herself of the splendid robe, and clothed herself
with sackcloth and being besprinkled with ashes, supplicated the merciful
God to go in with her to the king; and offering up her prayer to Him, these
were the words she uttered, "O Lord, make my words acceptable, and put
eloquent speech in my mouth." Let this be the prayer which we offer to
God for our Teacher. For if a woman, supplicating on behalf of the Jews,
prevailed to allay the wrath of a barbarian, much rather will our Teacher,
entreating on behalf of so great a city, and in conjunction with so great a
Church, be able to persuade this most mild and merciful Emperor. For if he
hath received authority to loose sins committed against God, much more
will he be able to take away and blot out those which have been committed
against a man. He is also himself a ruler and a ruler of more dignity than
the other. For the sacred laws take and place under his hands even the
royal head. And when there is need of any good thing from above, the
Emperor is accustomed to fly to the priest: but not the priest to the
Emperor. He too hath his breast-plate, that of righteousness. He too hath
his girdle, that of truth, and sandals of much greater dignity, those of the
Gospel of peace. He too hath a sword, not of iron, but of the Spirit; he too
hath a crown resting on his head. This panoply is the more splendid. The
weapons are grander, the license of speech greater, and mightier the
strength. So that from the weight of his authority, and from his own
greatness of soul; and more than all the rest, from the hope which he has in
God, he will address the Emperor with much freedom and much discretion.

7. Let us not then despair of our safety, but let us pray; let us make
invocation; let us supplicate; let us go on embassy to the King that is
above with many tears! We have this fast too as an ally, and as an
assistant in this good intercession. Therefore, as when the winter is over
and the summer is appearing, the sailor draws his vessel to the deep; and
the soldier burnishes his arms, and makes ready his steed for the battle;

and the husbandman sharpens his sickle; and the traveler boldly
undertakes a long journey, and the wrestler strips and bares himself for the
contest. So too, when the fast makes its appearance, like a kind of spiritual
summer, let us as soldiers burnish our weapons; and as husbandmen let us
sharpen our sickle; and as sailors let us order our thoughts against the
waves of extravagant desires; and as travelers let us set out on the journey
towards heaven; and as wrestlers let us strip for the contest. For the
believer is at once a husbandman, and a sailor, and a soldier, a wrestler, and
a traveler. Hence St. Paul saith, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
but against principalities, against powers. Put on therefore the whole
armor of God." Hast thou observed the wrestler? Hast thou observed the
soldier? If thou art a wrestler, it is necessary for thee to engage in the
conflict naked. If a soldier, it behooves thee to stand in the battle line
armed at all points. How then are both these things possible, to be naked,
and yet not naked; to be clothed, and yet not clothed! How? I will tell
thee. Divest thyself of worldly business, and thou hast become a wrestler.
Put on the spiritual armor, and thou hast become a soldier. Strip thyself of
worldly cares, for the season is one of wrestling. Clothe thyself with the
spiritual armor, for we have a heavy warfare to wage with demons.
Therefore also it is needful we should be naked, so as to offer nothing that
the devil may take hold of, while he is wrestling with us; and to be fully
armed at all points, so as on no side to receive a deadly blow. Cultivate
thy soul. Cut away the thorns. Sow the word of godliness. Propagate and
nurse with much care the fair plants of divine wisdom, and thou hast
become a husbandman. And Paul will say to thee, "The husbandman that
laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits. He too himself practiced this
art. Therefore writing to the Corinthians, he said, "I have planted, Apollos
watered, but God gave the increase." Sharpen thy sickle, which thou hast
blunted through gluttony - sharpen it by fasting. Lay hold of the
pathway which leads towards heaven; rugged and narrow as it is, lay hold
of it, and journey on. And how mayest thou be able to do these things? By
subduing thy body, and bringing it into subjection. For when the way
grows narrow, the corpulence that comes of gluttony is a great hindrance.
Keep down the waves of inordinate desires. Repel the tempest of evil
thoughts. Preserve the bark; display much skill, and thou hast become a
pilot. But we shall have the fast for a groundwork and instructor in all
these things.

8. I speak not, indeed, of such a fast as most persons keep, but of real
fasting; not merely an abstinence from meats; but from sins too. For the
nature of a fast is such, that it does not suffice to deliver those who
practice it, unless it be done according to a suitable law. "For the
wrestler," it is said, "is not crowned unless he strive lawfully." To the end
then, that when we have gone through the labor of fasting, we forfeit not
the crown of fasting, we should understand how, and after what manner, it
is necessary to conduct this business; since that Pharisee also fasted, but
afterwards went down empty, and destitute of the fruit of fasting. The
Publican fasted not; and yet he was accepted in preference to him who had
fasted; in order that thou mayest learn that fasting is unprofitable, except
all other duties follow with it. The Ninevites fasted, and won the favor of
God. The Jews, fasted too, and profited nothing, nay, they departed with
blame. Since then the danger in fasting is so great to those who do not
know how they ought to fast, we should learn the laws of this exercise, in
order that we may not "run uncertainly," nor "beat the air," nor while we
are fighting contend with a shadow. Fasting is a medicine; but a medicine,
though it be never soprofitable, becomes frequently useless owing to the
unskilfulness of him who employs it. For it is necessary to know,
moreover, the time when it should be applied, and the requisite quantity of
it; and the temperament of body that admits it; and the nature of the
country, and the season of the year; and the corresponding diet; as well as
various other particulars; any of which, if one overlooks, he will mar all
the rest that have been named. Now if, when the body needs healing, such
exactness is required on our part, much more ought we, when our care is
about the soul, and we seek to heal the distempers of the mind, to look,
and to search into every particular with the utmost accuracy.

9. Let us see then how the Ninevites fasted, and how they were delivered
from that wrath - "Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste
anything," saith (the prophet). What sayest thou? Tell me - must even
the irrational things fast, and the horses and the mules be covered with
sackcloth? "Even so," he replies. For as when, at the decease of some rich
man, the relatives clothe not only the men servants and maid servants, but
the horses also with sackcloth, and give orders that they should follow the
procession to the sepulcher, led by their grooms; thus signifying the
greatness of the calamity, and inviting all to pity; thus also, indeed, when

that city was about to be destroyed, even the irrational nature was
enveloped in sackcloth, and subjected to the yoke of fasting. "It is not
possible," saith he, "that irrational creatures should learn the wrath of God
by means of reason; let them be taught by means of fasting, that this
stroke is of divine infliction. For if the city should be overturned, not only
would it be one common sepulcher for us, the dwellers therein, but for
these likewise. Inasmuch then as these would participate in the
punishment, let them also do so in the fast. But there was yet another
thing which they aimed at in this act, which the prophets also are wont to
do. For these, when they see some dreadful chastisement proceeding from
heaven, and those who are to be punished without anything to say for
themselves; - laden with shame, - unworthy of the least pardon or
excuse: - not knowing what to do, nor from whence they may procure an
advocacy for the condemned, they have recourse to the things irrational;
and describing their death in tragical fashion, they make intercession by
them, putting forward as a plea their pitiable and mournful destruction.
When therefore, aforetime, famine had seized upon the Jews, and a great
drought oppressed their country, and all things were being consumed, one
of the prophets spoke thus, "The young heifers leaped in their stalls; the
herds of oxen wept, because there was no pasture; all the cattle of the field
looked upward to Thee, because the streams of waters were dried up."
Another prophet bewailing the evils of drought again speaks to this effect:
"The hinds calved in the fields and forsook it, because there was no grass.
The wild asses did stand in the forests; they snuffed up the wind like a
dragon; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass." Moreover, ye have
heard Joel saying today, "Let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and
the bride out of her closet; - the infants that suck the breast." For what
reason, I ask, does he call so immature an age to supplication? Is it not
plainly for the very same reason? For since all who have arrived at the age
of manhood, have inflamed and provoked God's wrath, let the age, saith
he, which is devoid of transgressions supplicate Him who is provoked.

10. But, as I said before, we may see what it was that dissolved such
inexorable wrath. Was it, forsooth, fasting only and sackcloth? We say not
so; but the change of their whole life. Whence does this appear? From the
very language of the prophet. For he who hath discoursed of the wrath of
God, and of their fasting, himself too, when speaking of the reconciliation,

and teaching us the cause of the reconciliation, speaks to this effect; "And
God saw their works." What kind of works? That they had fasted? That
they had put on sackcloth? Nothing of the sort: but passing all these
points in silence, he adds, "That they turned every one from their evil
ways, and the Lord repented of the evil that He had said He would do
unto them." Seest thou, that fasting did not rescue from this danger, but it
was the change of life, which rendered God propitious and kind to these
barbarians?

11. I have said these things, not that we may disparage fasting, but that we
may honor fasting; for the honor of fasting consists not in abstinence from
food, but in withdrawing from sinful practices; since he who limits his
fasting only to an abstinence from meats, is one who especially disparages
it. Dost thou fast? Give me proof of it by thy works! Is it said by what
kind of works? If thou seest a poor man, take pity on him! If thou seest in
enemy, be reconciled to him! If thou seest a friend gaining honor, envy him
not If thou seest a handsome woman, pass her by! For let not the mouth
only fast, but also the eye, and the ear, and the feet, and the hands, and all
the members of our bodies. Let the hands fast, by being pure from rapine
and avarice. Let the feet fast, by ceasing from running to the unlawful
spectacles. Let the eyes fast, being taught never to fix themselves rudely
upon handsome countenances, or to busy themselves with strange
beauties. For looking is the food of the eyes, but if this be such as is
unlawful or forbidden, it mars the fast; and upsets the whole safety of the
soul; but if it be lawful and safe, it adorns fasting. For it would be among
things the most absurd to abstain from lawful food because of the fast, but
with the eyes to touch even what is forbidden. Dost thou not eat flesh?
Feed not upon lasciviousness by means of the eyes. Let the ear fast also.
The fasting of the ear consists in refusing to receive evil speakings and
calumnies. "Thou shalt not receive a false report," it says.

12. Let the mouth too fast from disgraceful speeches and railing. For what
doth it profit if we abstain from birds and fishes; and yet bite and devour
our brethren? The evil speaker eateth the flesh of his brother, and biteth
the body of his neighbor. Because of this Paul utters the fearful saying, "If
ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of
another." Thou hast not fixed thy teeth in the flesh, but thou hast fixed the
slander in the soul, and inflicted the wound of evil suspicion; thou hast

harmed, in a thousand ways, thyself and him, and many others, for in
slandering a neighbor thou hast made him who listens to the slander worse;
for should he be a wicked man, he becomes more careless when he finds a
partner in his wickedness; and should he be a just man, he is lifted to
arrogance, and puffed up; being led on by the sin of others to imagine great
things concerning himself. Besides, thou hast struck at the common
welfare of the Church; for all those who hear not only accuse the
supposed sinner, but the reproach is fastened on the Christian community;
neither dost thou hear the unbelievers saying, "Such a person is a
fornicator, or a libertine;" but instead of the individual who hath sinned,
they accuse all Christians. In addition to this, thou hast caused the glory of
God to be blasphemed; for as His Name is glorified when we have good
report, so when we sin, it is blasphemed and insulted!

13. A fourth reason is, that thou hast disgraced him who is ill reported;
and hast thus rendered him more shameless than he was, by placing him in
a state of enmity and hostility. Fifthly, thou hast made thyself liable to
chastisement and vengeance; by involving thyself in matters which in no
way concerned thee. For let not any one tell me in reply, "Then I am an
evil speaker when I speak falsely, but if I speak what is true, I cease to be
so." Although it be with truth thou speakest evil, this also is a crime. For
that Pharisee spake evil of the Publican with truth; but nevertheless this
availed him not. For was not the latter, I ask, a publican and a sinner? It is
manifest to every one that he was a publican. But at the same time
inasmuch as the Pharisee spoke ill of him, he departed from the temple
with the loss of every advantage. Dost thou wish to correct a brother?
Weep; pray unto God; taking him apart, admonish, counsel, entreat him!
So also Paul did, "Lest," saith he, "when I come again, my God will
humble me among you, and I shall bewail many which have sinned already,
and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and
lasciviousness which they have committed." Show thy charity towards the
sinner. Persuade him that it is from care and anxiety for his welfare, and
not from a wish to expose him, that thou puttest him in mind of his sin.
Take hold of his feet; embrace him; be not ashamed, if thou truly desirest
to cure him. Physicians too do things of this sort, oftentimes, when their
patients are hard to please; by embraces and entreaties they at length
persuade them to take a salutary medicine. Thus also do thou. Show the

wound to the priest; that is the part of one who cares for him, and
provides for him, and is anxious on his behalf.

14. But not only do I now admonish the evil speakers; but those besides,
who hear others ill spoken of, I exhort to stop up their ears, and to imitate
the prophet who saith, "Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I
punish." Say to thy neighbor, "Hast thou any one to praise or highly to
commend? I open my ears, to receive the fragrant oil; but if thou hast any
evil to say, I block up the entrance to thy words, - for I am not to admit
dung and dirt. What profit doth it afford me to learn that such a one is a
bad man? The greatest injury indeed results from this, and the worst loss!"
Say to him, "Let us be anxious about our own faults; how we may render
up an account of our own transgressions; and exhibit this sort of curiosity
and meddlesome activity respecting our own lives. What excuse or pardon
shall we find; whilst we never even take into consideration our own affairs,
but thus inquisitively pry into those of others!" And as it is mean and
extremely disgraceful to peer into a house, and to observe what is within
as one passes, so also to make inquisition into another man's life is the last
degree of illiberality. But what is yet more ridiculous is, that those who
lead this sort of life, and are neglectful of their own affairs, when they have
mentioned any of these secret matters, beseech and adjure him who has
heard it, not to mention it more to any other person; thus making it plain
that they have done an action which deserves censure. For if thou
beseechest him to tell this to no other person, much more did it not
become thee to tell these things first to him. The matter was safe while in
thy possession; now, after betraying it, thou art grown anxious for its
safety. If thou art desirous that it be not carried abroad to another, do not
thyself tell it. But when thou hast betrayed the custody of the matter to
another, thou doest what is superfluous and useless, in charging him, and
putting him on oath for the safety of what has been spoken.

15. "But it is sweet to slander." Nay, it is sweet not to speak evil. For he
that hath spoken evil is henceforth contentious; he is suspicious and he
fears, repents, and gnaws his own tongue. Being timorous and trembling,
lest at any time, what he said should be carried to others, and bring great
peril, and useless and needless enmity, on the sayer. But he who keeps the
matter to himself, will spend his days in safety, with much pleasantness.
"Thou hast heard a word," we read, "let it die with thee; and be bold; it

will not burst thee." What is the meaning of this? "let it die with thee?"
Extinguish it; bury it; neither permit it to go forth, nor even to move at all;
but, as the best course, be careful not to tolerate others in the practice of
evil speaking. And should you perchance, at any time receive an
impression from it, bury it, destroy what has been uttered, deliver it over
to oblivion; in order that you may become like those who have not heard
it; and spend the present life with much peace and security. Should the
slanderers learn that we abhor them more than those do whom they
accuse, they themselves will henceforth abandon this evil habit, and
correct the sin; and will afterwards applaud, and proclaim us as those who
were their saviors and benefactors. For, as to speak well, and to applaud,
is the beginning of friendship, so to speak ill and to calumniate, has been
the beginning and foundation of enmity, and hatred, and a thousand
quarrels. From nothing else have our own affairs been more neglected, than
from the habit of prying into and meddling with the concerns of others; for
it is not possible for one who is given to evil speaking, and busying
himself with other men's lives, ever to look after his own life. His whole
study being expended upon meddling with other men's matters, all those
which belong to himself must of necessity be left at hazard and neglected.
For it is well if one who spends all his leisure on the anxious consideration
of his own sins, and the judgment of them, can make any progress. But
when thou art always busy about other men's matters, when wilt thou
pay any heed to thy own evils?

16. Let us flee then, beloved, let us flee slander! knowing that it is the very
gulf of Satan, and the place where he lurks with his snares. For in order
that we may be careless of our own state, and may thus render our account
heavier, the devil leads us into this custom. But more than this it is not
only a very serious matter, that we shall hereafter have to give account of
what we have spoken, but that we shall make our own offenses the heavier
by these means; depriving ourselves of all excuse. For he who scans with
bitterness the conduct of others, can never obtain pardon for the sins
committed by himself. For God will determine the sentence, not only from
the nature of our transgressions, but from the judgment which thou hast
passed upon others. Therefore He gave the admonition, "Judge not, that
ye be not judged." For the sin, of whatever kind, will not there appear any
more such as it was when committed, but will receive a great and

unpardonable addition from the judgment passed by thee upon thy fellow
servants. For as he who is humane, and merciful, and forgiving, cuts away
the greater mass of his sins, so he who is bitter, and cruel, and implacable,
greatly increases the magnitude of his own offenses. Let us then expel
from our mouth all slander, knowing that if we do not abstain from it,
though we might feed upon ashes, this austerity would avail us nothing.
"For not that which entereth into, but that which cometh out of the mouth
defileth the man." If any one were to stir up a cesspool, when you were
passing, say, would you not reproach and rate the man who did it? This
then also do with respect to the slanderer. For the stirred cesspool does
not so grossly offend the sense of those who smell that ill savor, as the
stirring up other men's sins, and the exposure of an impure life, offends
and disturbs the soul of those who hear of it. Therefore let us abstain from
evil speaking, from foul language, from blasphemy; and let us not speak ill
of our neighbor, nor of God!

17. For many of our evil speakers have run into such madness, as to lift up
their own tongue from their fellow servants against their Master. But how
great an evil this is, you may learn from the affairs in which we are now
involved. A man is insulted, and, lo! we are all fearing and trembling, both
those who were guilty of the insult, and those who are conscious of
nothing of the kind! But God is insulted every day! Why do I say every
day? - every hour rather, by the rich, by the poor, by those who are at
ease, by the afflicted, by those who calumniate, and those who are
calumniated, and yet no one ever hears a word of this! Therefore He has
permitted our fellow servant to be insulted, in order that from the danger
which has happened through this insult, thou mayest learn the benignity
of the Lord! And notwithstanding that this is our first and only offense,
we do not on that account expect to gain an excuse, or pardon. But we
provoke God every day, and we show no signs of returning to Him, and
yet He endures it with all long-suffering! Seest thou then how great the
benignity of the Lord is? Yet, in this present outrage, those who had done
amiss were taken and thrust into prison, and paid the penalty;
nevertheless we are still in fear, for he who has been insulted has not as
yet heard what has taken place, nor pronounced sentence, and we are all
trembling. But God every day hears of the insults offered Him, and no one
heeds it, although God is thus merciful and loving toward man. With Him

it suffices only to acknowledge the sin, and so to cancel the accusation.
But with man it is altogether the reverse. When those who have sinned
confess, then they are punished the more; which indeed has happened in
the present instance. And some have perished by the sword, some by fire;
some given to wild beasts, and not men only, but children. And neither
this immaturity of age, nor the tumult of the people, nor the circumstance
that they were infuriated by demons when they perpetrated these deeds;
nor that the exaction was thought to be intolerable; nor poverty, nor
having offended in company with all; nor promising that they would never
hereafter dare to repeat such deeds; nor anything else, could at all rescue
them; but they were led away to the pit, without reprieve; armed soldiers
conducting and guarding them on either side, lest any one should carry off
the criminals; whilst mothers also followed afar off, seeing their children
beheaded, but not daring to bewail their calamity; for terror conquered
grief, and fear overcame nature! And just as when men beholding from the
land those who are shipwrecked, are deeply distressed, but are not able to
approach and to rescue the drowning, so too here, the mothers restrained
through fear of the soldiers, as it were by so many waves, not only dared
not go near to their children, and rescue them from condemnation, but were
afraid even to shed tears?

18. Assuredly ye gather from thence the mercy of God, how unspeakable,
how boundless, how transcending all description! Here indeed the person
who has been insulted is of the same nature; and only once in all his
lifetime has experienced this; and then it was not done to his face; nor
while he was present to see or hear it; and nevertheless, none of those who
perpetrated these deeds obtained pardon. But with regard to God nothing
of the kind can be said; for the interval between man and God, is so great,
as no language can at all express; and throughout every day He is insulted,
although present, and seeing and hearing it: and yet He sends not forth the
lightning, nor commands the sea to overflow the land, and submerge all
men; nor does He bid the earth to cleave asunder and swallow up all the
contumelious; but He forbears, and suffers long, and still offers to pardon
those who have insulted Him, if they only repent and promise to do these
things no more! Truly now is the season to proclaim "Who can utter the
mighty acts of the Lord? who can show forth all His praise?" How many
men have not only cast down, but also trodden under foot the images of

God! For when thou throttlest a debtor, when thou strippest him, when
thou draggest him away thou tramplest under foot God's image. Hear for a
certainty Paul saying, that "a man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch
as he is the image and glory of God." And again, hear God Himself saying,
"Let us make man in Our Image, after Our likeness." But if thou sayest
that man is not of the same substance as God, - what matters that? For
neither was the brazen statue of the same substance as the Emperor; yet
nevertheless, they who defied it paid the penalty. Thus also with regard to
mankind, if men are not of the same substance as God, (as indeed they are
not), still they have been called His image; and it were fitting they should
receive honor on account of the appellation. But thou for the sake of a
little gold dose trample them under foot, dose throttle them, and drag them
away; and hast not to this day in any wise paid the penalty!

19. May there be then speedily some favorable and propitious change!
This certainly I foretell and testify, that although this cloud should pass
away, and we yet remain in the same condition of listlessness, we shall
again have to suffer much heavier evils than those we are now dreading; for
I do not so much fear the wrath of the Emperor, as your own listlessness.
Surely it is not sufficient by way of apology that we supplicate two or
three days, but it is necessary that we should make a change in our whole
life, and that whilst abstaining from wickedness we should persevere
continually in virtue. For as those who are sickly, unless they keep up a
constant regimen, would find no advantage by their observing a two or
three days' discipline; so those who are in sin, if they do not exercise
sobriety at all times, will find no benefit in two or three days' amendment.
For as it is said, that he who is washed, and is again afterwards polluted
with the mire, hath gained nothing; so he who has repented for three days,
and has again returned to his former state, has accomplished nothing. Let
us not therefore, now act as we have always. done hitherto. For many
times, when we have been surprised by earthquakes, as well as famine and
drought, after becoming more sober and gentle for three or four days, we
did but return again to the former course. For this cause our present
troubles have happened. But if we have not done so before; yet, now at
least let us all persevere in the same piety; let us preserve the same
meekness, that we may not again need another stroke. Was not God able
to have prevented what has taken place? He did, however, permit it, that

He might make those who despised Him more sober-minded, through
dread of a fellow-servant!

20. But let not any one say that many of the guilty escaped, and that
many of the innocent incurred punishment. For I hear of numerous
persons who frequently say this; not only in the case of the present
sedition, but also in many other circumstances of this. nature. What then
should I reply to those who make such observations? Why, that if he who
was captured was innocent of the present sedition, he had wrought some
other transgression before this still more grievous, for which, not having
afterwards repented, he has paid the penalty at the present time. For thus
is the custom of God to deal with us. When we sin, He does not
straightway visit the transgression, but lets it pass, giving us space for
repentance, in order that we may be amended and converted. But if,
because we have not paid the penalty, we suppose that the offense too is
blotted out, and make light of it; then somewhere, where we think not of
it, we are sure afterwards to be punished. And this takes place in order
that, when we sin and are not punished, we may not be free from fear,
unless we amend, knowing that we shall certainly fall into punishment
where we do not expect it. So that if thou sinnest, beloved, and art not
punished, do not grow presumptuous, but for this very cause be the more
alarmed, knowing that it is an easy matter with God to recompense again
when he pleases. For this reason then he hath not punished thee, that thou
mightest receive space for repentance. Let us not therefore say, that such a
person whilst innocent incurred punishment; and another whilst guilty
escaped, for he who incurred it, being guiltless, as I observed, paid the
punishment of other transgressions; and he who now escapes it, if he
repents not, will be captured in another snare. If our minds are thus
disposed, we shall never forget our own sins, but, always fearful and
trembling lest we should have to pay the penalty, we shall readily recollect
them. For nothing is so apt to bring sin to remembrance as punishment and
chastisement. And this is shown by Joseph's brethren. For when they had
sold the just man, and thirteen years had passed away, suspecting they
had fallen into punishment, and fearing for their lives, they remembered
their sin, and said one to another, "We are verily guilty concerning our
brother Joseph." Seest thou, how fear brought their guilt to recollection?
And yet when they were sinning they perceived it not, but when they

were fearful of being punished, then they remembered it? Knowing,
therefore, all these things, let us make a change and amendment of our
lives; and let us think of religion and virtue, before we think of deliverance
from the impending distress.

21. And in the meanwhile I desire to fix three precepts in your mind, to
the end that you may accomplish me these during: the fast, - viz. to
speak ill of no one; to hold no one for an enemy; and to expel from the
mouth altogether the evil custom of oaths. Anti as when we hear that some
money tax is imposed, each one going within, and calling his wife and
children and servants, considers and consults with them how he may pay
this tribute, so also let us do with respect to these spiritual precepts. Let
every one when he has returned home call together his wife and children,
and let him say, that a spiritual tribute was imposed this day: a tribute by
which there will be some deliverance and removal of these evils; a tribute
which does not make those who pay it poor, but richer; that is to say, to
have no enemy, to speak evil of no man, and to swear not at all. Let us
consider; let us think; let us resolve how we may fulfill these precepts. Let
us exert every endeavor. Let us admonish each other. Let us correct each
other, that we may not go to the other world as debtors, and then, needing
to borrow of others, suffer the fate of the foolish virgins, and fall from
immortal salvation. If we thus set our lives in order, I warrant you and
promise, that from this there will be deliverance from the present calamity,
and a removal of these dreadful ills; and what is greater than all, there will
be the enjoyment of the good things to come. For it were fitting that I
should commit to you the whole body of virtue; but I think it the best
method of correction, to take the laws by parts, and reduce them to
practice, and then to proceed to others. For as in a given field, the
husbandman, digging it all up piecemeal, gradually comes to the end of his
task; so we too if we make this rule for ourselves, in any wise to reduce to
a correct practice these three precepts during the present Lent, and to
commit them to the safe custody of good habit, we shall proceed with
greater ease to the rest; and by this means arriving at the summit of
spiritual wisdom, we shall both reap the fruit of a favorable hope in the
present life; and in the life to come we shall stand before Christ with great
confidence, and enjoy those unspeakable blessings; which, God grant, we
may all be found worthy of, through the grace and loving kindness of Jesus

Christ our Lord, with Whom be glory to the Father and the Holy Spirit
forever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 4

An exhortation to the people respecting fortitude and patience, from
the examples of Job and the Three Children in Babylon. The Homily
concludes with an address on the subject of abstaining from oaths.

1. BLESSED be God! who hath comforted your sorrowing souls, and
stayed your agitated spirits! For that ye have received no small
consolation is evident by the desire and readiness to listen which ye are
now showing. For it is impossible that a soul in anguish, and oppressed
with the cloud of despondency, should have power to hear with readiness
anything that is spoken. But I see you are attending to us with much good
will, and with an intense earnestness; and that you have shaken off gloomy
thoughts, and put aside the sense of present distress, in your affectionate
desire of listening. For this cause, I thank God heartily together with you,
that the calamity has not overmatched your philosophy; nor fear relaxed
your vigor; nor tribulation quenched your alacrity; nor danger dried up
your zeal: nor the fear of men overcome the desire for God; nor the
difficulty of the times overthrown your earnestness; nay, so far from
overthrowing, it has strengthened it; so far from slackening, it has given it
more intensity; so far from quenching, haskindled it the more. The forum
is indeed empty, but the church is filled; the former supplies material for
melancholy, the latter is an occasion of joy and spiritual gladness! When
therefore, beloved, you betake yourself to the forum, and the sight of the
solitude calls forth a groan, fly back to thy Mother, and straightway she
will console thee with the multitude of her offspring and will show thee
the chorus of the Brethren complete, and will drive away all thy
despondency! For in the city we are as earnestly longing to see human
beings, as those who inhabit the deserts; but when we take refuge in the
church, we are straitened for room by the multitude. And as when the sea
is in uproar, and rendered furious by the violent tempest, fear compels all
to fly for refuge from without into the harbor; so also now, the waves of
the forum, and the tempest of the city, drives together every one from all
sides into the church, and by the bond of love knits the members close to
one another.

2. Let us then give thanks to God even for these things, that we have
reaped so much fruit from the tribulation; that we have received so great an
advantage from the trial. If there were no trial, there would be no crown; if
there were no wrestlings, there would be no prize; if there were no lists
marked out, there would be no honors; if there were no tribulation, there
would be no rest; if there were no winter, there would be no summer. And
this may be observed, not only amongst men, but even with the very
seeds; for if, in that case, we expect the ear of corn to spring and flourish,
there must be much rain, much gathering of the clouds, and much frost; and
the time of sowing is also a rainy season. Since therefore the winter, a
winter not of the elements, but of souls, has now set in, let us too sow in
this winter that we may reap in the summer; let us sow tears, that we may
reap gladness. This is not my word, it is a prophetic promise, "They who
sow in tears, shall reap in joy." The rain which cometh down, doth not so
make the seeds to sprout and grow, as the shower of failing tears maketh
the seed of godliness to spring up and flourish. This it is that cleanseth the
soul; watereth the mind, and causeth the growing, germ of doctrine to push
rapidly forwards. For this reason also, it is needful to plough up a deep
furrow. This the Prophet signified when he spoke thus, "Break up your
fallow ground, and sow not among thorns." Therefore, as when he who has
set the plough on the field, turns up the earth from below, preparing
beforehand a safe lodgment for the seeds, in order that they may not lie
dispersed over the surface, but may be hidden in the very womb of the
earth, and deposit their roots in safety: so also it is our business to act;
and making use of the plough of tribulation to break up the depth of the
heart. For another Prophet admonishes of this, when he says, "Rend your
hearts and not your garments." Let us then rend our hearts, that if any evil
plant, any treacherous thought be present in us, we may tear it up by the
roots, and provide a pure soil for the seeds of godliness. For if we do not
now break up the fallow ground; if we do not now sow; if we do not now
water it with tears, whilst it is a time of tribulation and fasting, when shall
we ever be brought to compunction? Will it be when we are at ease, and in
luxury? But this is impossible. For ease and luxury generally lead to
indolence, just as tribulation leads back again to diligence; and restores to
itself the mind that had wandered abroad, and been dreaming after a
multitude of objects.

3. Let us not then grieve on account of this despondency, but even give
thanks to God, for great is the gain that comes of tribulation. The
husbandman, when he has sown the seed he had gathered with so much
labor, prays that a shower may come; and the ignorant man, looking on,
will be surprised at all that takes place; and perhaps say to himself, "what
can this man be doing? He is scattering what he has collected; and not only
scattering, but he is also mixing it up in the earth with much industry, so
that it will be no easy matter for him to collect these together again; and
besides mixing them with the earth, he is moreover desiring a heavy rain,
so that all he has cast therein will rot, and become mire." Such a person is
also terrified when he observes the thunders bursting through the clouds,
and the lightnings striking downwards. But not so the farmer. He is glad
and rejoices whilst beholding the heavy rain. For he does not regard what
is present, but awaits the future. He does not attend to the thunderings,
but is reckoning the number of his sheaves. He thinks not of the decaying
seed, but of the flourishing ears of corn; not of the tedious ram, but of the
delightful dust of the threshing floor. Thus indeed, also, should we regard,
not our present tribulation, nor the pain of it, but the benefit that may
arise from it - the fruit that it will bring forth. Let us wait for the sheaves
of the threshing floor; for if we be sober, we shall be able to collect much
fruit from the present time, and to fill the granaries of our minds. If we be
sober, we shall not only be far from taking any harm from this trouble, but
we shall also reap innumerable benefits. But should we be slothful, even
tranquillity will destroy us! Either of these things is injurious to him who
takes no heed; but they both profit him who lives with strictness. And
even as gold if it be covered with water, still shows its own proper beauty,
and although it should fall into the furnace, would again come forth
brighter than before; but on the other hand, should clay or grass be mixed
with water, the one dissolves and the other corrupts; and should they fall
into the fire, the one is parched and the other is burnt up; so also in truth it
is with the just man and the sinner! For should the former enjoy repose, he
remains illustrious, even as gold is when immersed in water; and though he
falls into trial, he becomes the more illustrious, like gold when subjected to
the test of fire; but the sinner, if he obtains rest, is enervated and corrupted
like the grass and the clay, when they come in contact with water; and
should he undergo trial, he is burnt up and destroyed, in the same way as
the grass and the clay are by the action of fire!

4. Let us not then be out of heart for the present evils; for if thou hast any
sins remaining, they will disappear, and easily be burnt up by the
tribulation; but if thou possessest virtue, thou wilt become thereby more
illustrious and distinguished; for if thou art continually vigilant and sober,
thou wilt be superior to all injury. For it is not the nature of the trials, but
the listlessness of those who are tried, that is apt to cause their overthrow.
So that if thou desirest to rejoice, and to enjoy ease and pleasure, seek
neither for pleasure nor ease, but seek for a soul full of patience, and one
that is able to manifest fortitude; since if thou hast not this, not only will
trial put thee to shame, but repose will destroy and overthrow thee yet
more signally. For to prove that it is not the attack of evils, but the
listlessness of the mind which subverts our salvation, hear what Christ
saith: "Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will
liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock; and the rain
descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that
house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock." And again: "Every
one who heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be
likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand; and the
rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it." Do you perceive that it
was not the attack of these trials that produced the overthrow, but the
folly of the builders? For there was rain there, and there was rain here;
there were floods there, and there were floods here; here the beating of
winds, and there again the same. The one man built a house, and the other
built a house. The building was the same; the trials were the same; but the
end was not the same; because there was not the same foundation. For the
folly of the builder, not the nature of the trials, caused the fall of the
building; otherwise the house that was founded upon the rock should have
fallen, whereas nothing of that kind befell it. But do not suppose that
these things were spoken merely of a house; for the discourse relates to a
soul, giving proof by its works that it hears the divine word, or rejects it.
Thus Job builded up his soul. The rain descended; - for the fire fell from
heaven and devoured all his flocks; the floods came; - the frequent, - the
constant, - the successive messengers of his calamities, telling him of the
destruction of his herds - of his camels - of his children. The winds
blew, - the bitter words of his wife: - "Curse God," she said, "and die."
Yet the house fell not: the soul was not supplanted: the just man did not

blaspheme; but even gave thanks thus, saying, "The Lord gave and the
Lord hath taken away. As it pleased the Lord, so is it come to pass." Seest
thou that not the nature of the trials, but the negligence of the indolent, is
wont to cause the overthrow? since tribulation makes the strong man
stronger. Who saith this? It is the man who lived in tribulation, the blessed
Paul; he speaks thus: "Tribulation worketh patience, and patience
probation, and probation hope." And even as the violence of the wind,
when it rushes upon strong trees, and sways them in all directions, does
not root them up, but renders them still firmer and stronger by these
attacks; so the soul that is holy, and lives in a religious state, is not
supplanted by the inroads of trial and tribulation, but stimulated thereby
to more patience; even as the blessed Job, whom they made more
illustrious and honorable.

5. At the present time then, a man is angry with us, a man of like passions,
and of like soul, and we are afraid: but in the case of Job it was an evil and
malignant demon who was angry; nay, he was not simply angry, but set in
motion all sorts of machinations, and brought forward every stratagem;
and yet even with all he could not conquer the fortitude of the just man.
But here is a man, who is at one time angry, at another time is reconciled;
and we are nevertheless dead with fear. On that occasion it was a devil that
waged war, who is never reconciled to human nature, but has engaged in a
war without treaty, and a battle without truce against our race; yet
nevertheless, the just man laughed his darts to scorn. What apology then,
or what pardon can be ours, if we cannot sustain a human trial; we who are
taught such spiritual wisdom under grace; when this man before grace, and
before the Old Testament, endured this most grievous war so nobly!
These things, beloved, we should therefore always discourse of with one
another; and by words of this kind encourage ourselves. For ye are
witnesses, and your conscience is a witness how much gain we have
already received from this trial! The dissolute man hath now become
sober; the bold man meek; the slothful man active. They who never at any
time saw a church, but constantly spent their time at the theater. now
remain in the church the whole day long. Tell me then, dost thou grieve on
this account, that God hath made thee earnest through fear; that He hath
led thee by tribulation to a sense of thine own safety? But is thy
conscience pained? Yea, is thy mind pierced every day as with a dart,

expecting death, and the greatest wrath? Nevertheless, from thence too we
shall gain a great advance toward virtue, if our piety is made more earnest
by means of the distress. For God is able to free you from all these evils
this day. But not until He sees that you are purified; not until He sees that
a conversion has taken place, and a repentance firm and unshaken, will He
entirely remove the tribulation. The goldsmith, until he perceives the gold
well refined, will not draw it out from the furnace; and even so God will
not take away this cloud before He hath thoroughly amended us. For He
Himself who hath permitted this trial, knows the time for removing it. So
it is also with one who plays the harp; he neither overstrains the string,
lest he break it, nor relaxes it too much, lest he mar the consonance of its
harmony. Thus does God act. He neither places our souls in a state of
constant repose, nor of lengthened tribulation; making use of both these at
His discretion; for he neither suffers us to enjoy continual repose, lest we
should grow listless, nor on the other hand does he permit us to be in
constant tribulation, lest we sink under it, and become desperate.

6. Let us then leave to Him the time for the removal of our evils; let us
only pray; let us live in piety: for this is our work, toturn to virtue; but to
set us free from these evils is God's work! For indeed He is more desirous
to quench this fire than thou who art tried by it: but He is waiting for thy
salvation. As tribulation then came of rest, so also after tribulation, rest
must be expected. For neither is it always winter, nor always summer;
neither are there always waves, nor always a calm; neither always night,
nor always day. Thus tribulation is not perpetual, but there will be also
repose; only in our tribulation, let us give thanks to God always. For the
three youths were cast into the furnace, and did not even for this forget
their piety; neither did the flames affright them, but more earnestly than
men sitting in a chamber, and suffering nothing to alarm them, did they,
whilst encircled by the fire, send up to heaven those sacred prayers -
therefore the fire became a wall unto them, and the flame a robe; and the
furnace was a fountain; and whereas it received them bound, it restored
them free. It received bodies that were mortal, but abstained from them as
if they had been immortal! It knew their nature, yet it reverenced their
piety! The tyrant bound their feet, and their feet bound the operation of
the fire! O marvelous thing! The flame loosed those who were bound, and
was itself afterwards bound by those who had been in bonds; for the piety

of the youths changed the nature of things; or rather it did not change the
nature, but, what was far more wonderful, it stayed the operation of them,
even whilst their nature remained. For it did not quench the fire, but
though burning, made it powerless. And it was truly marvelous and
unaccountable, that this not only happened with respect to the bodies of
these saints, but also with respect to their garments, and their shoes. And
as it was in the case of the Apostles, the garments of Paul expelled
diseases and demons, and the shadow of Peter put death to flight; so
indeed also in this case the shoes of these youths extinguished the power
of the fire.

7. I know not how I should speak, for the wonder surpasses all
description! The force of the fire was both quenched and not quenched: for
whilst it came in contact with the bodies of these saints, it was quenched;
but when it was needful to burst their bonds, it was not quenched;
wherefore it broke their bonds, but touched not their ankles. Do you see
how very near it was? Yet the fire was not deceived, and dared not
penetrate within the bonds. The tyrant bound, and the flame set loose;
that thou mightest learn at once the fierceness of the barbarian, and the
submissiveness of the element. For what reason did he bind, when he was
about to cast into the fire? In order that the miracle might be the greater;
that the sign might be the more unaccountable; that thou mayest not
suppose that the things seen were an optical delusion. For if that fire had
been no fire, it would not have consumed the bands; and what is much
more, it would not have seized upon the soldiers who were placed without
the furnace; but as the case was, it showed its power upon those without;
but towards those within, its submissiveness. But observe, I pray, in
everything, how the devil by the very same means with which he fights
with the servants of God, pulls down his own power; not intentionally,
but because the wisdom and abundant contrivance of God turns all his
weapons and devices upon his own head; which assuredly happened on
that occasion. For the devil at that time inspiring the tyrant, neither
suffered the heads of the saints to be cut off with the sword, nor that they
should be delivered to wild beasts, nor punished in any such manner; but
that they should be thrown into the fire; to the end that not even any relics
of these saints should remain, their bodies being altogether consumed, and
their ashes being mingled with the ashes of the fagots. But God

accordingly employed this very circumstance for the taking away of
impiety And how? I will tell you. Fire is accounted by the Persians to be a
God; and the barbarians, who inhabit that country even now honor it with
much worship. God, therefore, being desirous to pull up by the roots the
material of impiety, permitted the punishment to take this form, in order
that He might give the victory to His servants before the eyes of all these
fire-worshippers; persuading them by the plain fact, that the gods of the
Gentiles are in dread not of God only, but even of the servants of God.

8. Consider, moreover, how the crown of this victory was woven by the
adversaries, and the enemies themselves were made witnesses of this
trophy. For "Nebuchadnezzar," it says, "sent to gather together the
princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the sheriffs, and all the
rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image, and they
were all gathered together." The enemy prepares the theater, and he
himself collects together the spectators, and prepares the lists; a theater
too, not of chance persons, or of some private individuals, but of all those
who were honorable and in authority, to the end that their testimony may
be worthy of credit with the multitude. They had come summoned for one
thing; but they all departed having beheld another thing. They came in
order to worship the image; and they departed, having derided the image,
and struck with wonder at the power of God, through the signs which had
taken place with respect to these young men. And observe, where the field
for this display was spread out. No city, nor select enclosure furnished
room for this theater of the whole world, but smooth and naked plains.
For in the plain of Dura, outside the city, he set up the image, and the
herald came and cried, "To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and
languages, that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,
sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and
worship the golden image;" (for a fall indeed it was to worship the idol)
"and whoso falleth not down, and worshippeth, shall the same hour be
cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace." Seest thou how difficult
these struggles are made; how irresistible the snare; and how deep the gulf,
and a precipice on either hand? But be not afraid. In whatever degree the
enemy increases his machinations, so much the more does he display the
courage of the young men. For this reason is there this symphony of so
many musicians; for this reason the burning furnace; in order that both

pleasure, and fear, may besiege the souls of those present. Is there any one
of harsh and unyielding character among them? "Let the melody of every
kind of music," saith he, "enchant and soften him." But is he superior to
this artifice, "let the sight of the flame affright and astound him." Thus
was fear as well as pleasure present; the one entering to assault the soul by
the ears, the other by the eyes. But the noble character of these youths
was not by any such means to be conquered; but even as, when they fell
into the fire, they mastered the flames, even so they derided all desire and
all fear. For it was for them the devil had prepared all these things
beforehand. For he had no doubts of his own subjects, but was exceedingly
confident that no one would resist the royal mandate. But when all fell
down, and were subdued, then the youths alone are led into the midst; in
order that from this too the conquest may become the more illustrious,
they alone conquering and being proclaimed victors among so vast a
multitude. For this would not have been so surprising if they had acted
courageously at the first, when as yet no one had been overthrown. But
the greatest, and most astonishing fact was, that the multitude of those
who fell down, neither affrighted, nor enfeebled them. They did not say to
themselves any such things as many are ofttimes wont to say; "If we were
the first, and the only persons to worship the image, this would have been
a sin: but if we do this with so many myriads, who will not make
allowance? who will not think us worthy of defense?" nothing of that sort
did they say or think, when they beheld the prostrate forms of so many
tyrants. Consider thou also with me the wickedness of those who were
their accusers, and how maliciously and bitterly they brought the
accusation! "There are," say they, "certain Jews whom thou hast set up
over the works of the province of Babylon." They did not merely make
mention of the nation, but they also bring to mind their honorable
condition, that they may inflame the wrath of the king; almost as if they
had said, "These slaves, these captives, who are without a city, thou hast
made rulers over us. But they shew contempt for such honor, and treat
insolently him who has given them this honor! Therefore they say this;
"The Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of
Babylon, obey not thy decree, nor serve thy gods." The accusation
becomes their greatest praise; and the crimes imputed, their encomium; a
testimony indeed that is indubitable, since their enemies bring it forward.
What then does the king? He commands that they should be brought into

the midst, so that he may affright them in every way. But nothing
dismayed them, neither the wrath of the king, nor their being left alone in
the midst of so many, nor the sight of the fire, nor the sound of the
trumpet, nor the whole multitude looking fire at them; for deriding all these
things, as if they were about to be cast into a cool fountain of water, they
entered the furnace uttering that blessed sentence, "We will not serve thy
gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."

9. I have not referred to this history without reason, but that ye may learn
that whether it be the wrath of a king, or the violence of soldiers, or the
envy of enemies, or captivity, or destitution, or fire, or furnace, or ten
thousand terrors, nothing will avail to put to shame or terrify a righteous
man. For if where the king was godless the youths were not dismayed at
the tyrant's wrath, how much more ought we to be confident, having an
emperor who is humane and merciful, and to express thankfulness to God
for this tribulation, knowing from what has now been said, that
tribulations render men more illustrious both in the presence of God and of
man, if they know how to bear them with fortitude! For indeed if these
had not been made slaves, we should not have known their freedom! If
they had not been captives, we should not have learned their nobility of
soul! If they had not been exiles from their country below, we should not
have known the excellency of their citizenship above! If the earthly king
had not been angry with them, we should not have known the favor with
which they were regarded by the heavenly King!

10. Thou too then, if thou hast Him for thy Friend, be not despairing,
although thou fallest into the furnace: and in like manner if He be angry,
think not thou art safe though thou be in Paradise. For Adam indeed was
in Paradise, yet, when he had provoked God, Paradise profited him
nothing. These youths were in the furnace; yet, since they were approved,
the furnace injured them not at all. Adam was in Paradise, but when he
was supine, he was supplanted! Job sat down on the dunghill, yet, since
he was vigilant he prevailed! Yet how much better was Paradise than a
dunghill! still the excellency of the place benefited in no degree the
inhabitant; forasmuch as he had betrayed himself; as likewise indeed the
vileness of the place did to one no injury, who was fortified on every side
with virtue. As to ourselves then, let us fortify our souls; for if the loss of
wealth should threaten us, or even death, and yet no one can rob us of our

religion, we are the happiest of men, Christ commended this when he said,
"Be ye wise as serpents." For just as he exposes the whole body in order
that he may save the head, so also do thou. Although it should be
necessary to expose wealth, or the body, or the present life, or all things,
for the purpose of preserving thy religion; be not cast down! For if thou
depart hence in possession of that, God will restore to thee all things with
more abundant splendor, and will raise again thy body with greater glory;
and instead of riches, there will be the good things that surpass all power
of description. Did not Job sit naked on a dunghill, sustaining a life more
grievous than ten thousand deaths? Yet since he did not cast away his
piety, all his former things came back to him in greater abundance,
soundness and beauty of body; his full band of children; his possessions;
and what was greater than all, the splendid crown of his patience. For as it
happens with trees, should any one pluck away the fruit and the leaves
together; should he even cut off all the branches letting the root only
remain; the tree will rise again entire, with greater beauty, so indeed is it
also with us. If the root of piety remain, although wealth be taken away,
although the body destroyed, all things again revert to us with greater
glory than before. Casting away therefore all anxiety and superfluous care,
let us return to ourselves; and let us adorn the body and the soul with the
ornament of virtue; converting our bodily members into instruments of
righteousness and not instruments of sin.

11. And first of all, let us discipline our tongue to be the minister of the
grace of the Spirit, expelling from the mouth all virulence and malignity,
and the practice of using disgraceful words. For it is in our power to make
each one of our members an instrument of wickedness, or of righteousness.
Hear then how men make the tongue an instrument, some of sin, others of
righteousness! "Their tongue is a sharp sword." But another speaks thus
of his own tongue: "My tongue is the pen of a ready writer." The former
wrought destruction; the latter wrote the divine law. Thus was one a
sword, the other a pen, not according to its own nature, but according to
the choice of those who employed it. For the nature of this tongue and of
that was the same, but the operation was not the same. And again, as to
the mouth likewise, we may see this same thing. For these had a mouth
full of filth and of wickedness, therefore against such it is said by way of
accusation, "Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;" not such was

his, but "My mouth shall speak of wisdom, and the meditation of my
heart shall be of understanding." Again, there were others who had their
hands full of iniquity, and accusing these he said, "Iniquities are in their
hands, and their right hand is filled with gifts." But he himself had hands
practiced in nothing but in being stretched out towards heaven. Therefore
he said of these too, "The lifting up of my hands (let it be) an evening
sacrifice." The same may also be perceived with reference to the heart; for
their heart indeed was foolish, but this man's was true; hence he speaks of
them thus, "Their heart is vain;" but of his own, "My heart is inditing of a
good matter." And as to the ear, one may see that the case is the same; for
some have a sense of bearing like that of beasts, which is not to be
charmed or moved to pity; and reproaching such the Psalmist says, "They
are like the deaf adder, that stoppeth her ears." But his ear was the
receptacle of the divine words, and this he again makes manifest, when he
says, "I will incline mine ear to a parable, I will open my dark speech
upon the harp."

12. Knowing these things then, let us fortify ourselves with virtue on all
sides, and thus we shall avert the wrath of God, and let us make the
members of the body instruments of righteousness; and let us discipline
eyes, and mouth, and hands, and feet, and heart, and tongue, and the whole
body, to be employed only in the service of virtue. And let us remember
those three precepts, of which I discoursed to your Charity, exhorting you
to consider no one as an enemy, nor to speak evil of any one of those who
have aggrieved you; and to expel from your mouth the evil custom of
oaths. And with respect to the two former precepts, we will discourse to
you on another occasion; but we shall speak to you during the whole of
the present week respecting oaths; thus beginning with the easier precept.
For it is no labor at all to overcome the habit of swearing, if we would but
apply a little endeavor, by reminding each other; by advising; by
observing; and by requiring those who thus forget themselves, to render an
account, and to pay the penalty. For what advantage shall we gain by
abstinence from meats, if we do not also expel the evil habits of the soul?
Lo, we have spent the whole of this day fasting; and in the evening we
shall spread a table, not such as we did on yester-eve, but one of an altered
and more solemn kind. Can any one of us then say that he has changed his
life too this day; that he has altered his ill custom, as well as his food?

Truly, I suppose not! Of what advantage then is our fasting? Wherefore I
exhort and I will not cease to exhort, that undertaking each precept
separately, you should spend two or three days in the attainment of it;
and just as there are some who rival one another in fasting, and shew a
marvelous emulation in it; (some indeed who spend two whole days
without food; and others who, rejecting from their tables not only the use
of wine, and of oil, but of every dish, and taking only bread and water,
persevere in this practice during the whole of Lent); so, indeed, let us also
contend mutually with one another in abolishing the frequency of oaths.
For this is more useful than any fasting; this is more profitable than any
austerity. And this same care which we display in abstaining from food,
let us exhibit with respect to abstinence from oaths; since we shall be
chargeable with the reproach of extreme folly, while we regard not things
that are forbidden, and expend all our care upon things indifferent; for to
eat is not forbidden, but to swear is forbidden; we, however, abstaining
from those things that are permitted, daringly venture upon those things
that are forbidden! On this account I beseech your Charity to make some
change, and to let the beginning of it be visible from this day. For if we
spend the whole of the present fast with such zeal, having in this week
attained the practice of not swearing at all; and in the following having
extinguished wrath; and in that which succeeds it, having pulled up
evil-speaking by the roots; and after that, having amended what yet
remains; thus going forward in our course, we shall come by little and little
to the very summit of virtue; and we shall escape the present danger; and
shall make God propitious; and the multitude will come back again to our
city; and we shall teach the fugitives that we are to place our hopes of
safety neither in security of place, nor in flight and retirement; but in piety
of soul, and in virtue of manners. And thus shall we obtain the good things
of this and of the future life; which, God grant! we my all be found worthy
of, by the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through
whom and with whom be glory to the Father, together with the Holy
Ghost, now and for ever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 5

The exhortation of the last Homily is Continued in this. The people
are exhorted to bear with fortitude the impending wrath of the
Emperor. The cases of Job and the Ninevites are referred to as
examples. It is shewn that men ought not to fear death, but sin.
What it is to die miserably is explained; and the Homily concludes
with an earnest dissuasive against the use of oaths.

1. THE discourse concerning the three young men, and the Babylonian
furnace, did, as it would seem, yesterday give no small comfort to your
Charity; and still more the example in the case of Job, and that dunghill
more to be venerated than any kingly throne. For from seeing a royal
throne no advantage results to the spectators, but only a temporary
pleasure, which has no profit; but from the sight of Job's dunghill, one
may derive every kind of benefit, yea, much divine wisdom and
consolation, in order to patience. Therefore to this day many undertake a
long pilgrimage, even across the sea, hastening from the extremities of the
earth, as far as Arabia, that they may see that dunghill; and having beheld
it, may kiss the land, which contained the wrestling-ground of such a
victor, and received the blood that was more precious than all gold! For the
purple shines not so brilliantly, as did that body when dyed not in
another's blood, but in its own! Even those very wounds were more
precious than all manner of jewels! For the nature of pearls is of no help to
our life; nor do they satisfy any necessary want on the part of those who
have them. But those wounds are a consolation for all sadness; and that
thou mayest learn this to be the truth, suppose any one were to lose a
beloved and only son. Shew him ten thousand pearls, and you will not
console his grief, or lighten his anguish; but recall to his mind the wounds
of Job, and thou wouldest easily be able to minister comfort by speaking
thus: "Why sorrowest thou, O man? Thou hast lost one son; but that
blessed man, after he had been bereaved of the whole family of his
children, both received a plague in his own flesh, and sat down naked upon
the dunghill, streaming with gore from every part, and his flesh gradually
wasting away; even he who was just, and true, so devout a man, who
stained from every evil deed, and had even God for a witness to his

virtue." By speaking thus thou wouldest extinguish all the sufferer's
sadness, and remove all his distress. Thus the wounds of the just man
become more useful than pearls!

2. Figure to yourselves then this wrestler; and imagine that you see that
dunghill, and himself sitting in the midst of it! That golden statue! set with
gems! I know not how to express it: for I am unable to find any material so
precious as to compare it with that body stained with blood! So far above
every substance, however costly, was the nature of that flesh, beyond all
comparison more precious, and those wounds more splendid than the
sun's beams; for these illumine the eyes of the body; but those enlighten
the eyes of the mind! those struck the devil with utter blindness!
Therefore it was, that after that blow, he started back and appeared no
more. And do thou, O beloved, learn thence too what advantage there is in
tribulation! For when the just man was rich, and enjoyed ease, he had the
means of accusing him. However falsely, yet still he had it in his power to
say, "Doth Job serve thee for nought?" But after he had stripped him and
made him poor, he dared not even open his mouth any more. When he was
wealthy, he prepared to wrestle with him, and threatened to overthrow
him; but when he had made him poor, and taken away all he had, and
thrown him into the deepest distress, then he started back. When indeed
his body was sound, he lifted up his hands against him, but when he had
battered his flesh, then he fled, - defeated! Seest thou how to the vigilant,
poverty is much better and more beneficial than riches; and infirmity and
sickness, than health; and trial, than tranquillity; inasmuch as it makes the
combatants more illustrious and vigorous?

3. Who hath seen or heard of such an astonishing contest? The fighters in
worldly contests, when they have battered the heads of their adversaries,
are then victorious, and are crowned! But this adversary, when he had
battered the body of the just man, perforating it with ulcers of every kind,
and had reduced him to great weakness, was then conquered, and drew
back. Even when he had pierced his ribs in every direction, he was no
gainer thereby; for he spoiled him not of his hidden treasure, but he made
him more conspicuous to us; and through that piercing he gave to all the
privilege to look into his interior, and to discern completely the whole of
his wealth! When he expected to prevail, then he withdrew with much
ignominy, and never again uttered a syllable! What is the matter, O devil?

For what cause withdrawest thou? Was not everything done that thou
chosest? Hast thou not taken away his flocks, his herds, his droves of
horses and of mules? Hast thou not also destroyed his troop of children?
and battered his flesh to pieces. For what reason with-drawest thou?
"Because," saith he, "every thing I chose is come to pass, and yet that
which I most desired should come to pass, and for which I did all those
things, is not come to pass; he hath not blasphemed! For it was in order to
this, continues he, that I was doing all those things; and as this is not come
to pass, I am no gainer by having deprived him of his wealth; or by the
destruction of his children; or by the plague inflicted upon his body; but
the reverse of what I purposed hath come to pass; I have made my enemy
more illustrious; I have added luster to his reputation." Perceivest thou, O
beloved, how great was the reward of tribulation? His body was fair and
sound before, but it became more venerable, when pierced through and
through by these wounds! And thus wool, fair as it is before the dyeing,
when it becomes purple, takes an indescribable beauty, and an additional
grace. But if he had not stripped him, we should not have known the good
condition of the victor; if he had not pierced the body with ulcers, the rays
within would not have shone forth. If he had not made him sit down upon
a dunghill, we should not have known his wealth. For a king sitting on a
throne is not so illustrious, as this man was notable and conspicuous,
whilst sitting upon his dunghill! For after the royal throne, comes death;
but after that dunghill, the kingdom of heaven!

4. Collecting then all these reasons, let us raise ourselves from the
dejection which oppresses us. For I have laid these histories before you,
not that ye may applaud what is spoken, but that ye may imitate the
virtue and the patience of such noble men; that ye may learn from the very
facts, that there is nothing of human ills to be dreaded, save sin only;
neither poverty, nor disease, nor insult, nor malicious treatment, nor
ignominy, nor death, which is accounted the worst of all evils. To those
who love spiritual wisdom, such things are only the names of calamities;
names which have no substantial reality. But the true calamity consists in
offending God, and in doing aught which is displeasing to Him. For tell me,
what is there in death. which is terrible? Is it because it transports thee
more quickly to the peaceful haven, and to that life which is free from
tumult? Although man should not put thee to death, will not the very law

of nature, at length stealing upon thee, separate the body from the soul;
and if this event which we fear does not happen now, it will happen
shortly.

5. I speak thus, not anticipating any dread or melancholy event: God
forbid! But because I am ashamed for those who are afraid of death. Tell
me, whilst expecting such good things as "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
nor have entered the heart of man," dost thou demur about this enjoyment,
and art negligent and slothful; and not only slothful, but fearful and
trembling? And is it not shameful that thou art distressed on account of
death, whereas Paul groaned on account of the present life, and writing to
the Romans said, "The creation groaneth together, and ourselves also
which have the first fruits of the Spirit do groan." And he spoke thus, not
as condemning the things present, but longing for the things to come. "I
have tasted," saith he, "of the grace, and I do not willingly put up with the
delay. I have the first fruits of the Spirit, and I press on towards the
whole. I have ascended to the third heaven; I have seen that glory which is
unutterable; I have beheld the shining palaces; I have learnt what joys I am
deprived of, while I linger here, and therefore do I groan." For suppose any
one had conducted thee into princely halls, and shewn thee the gold
everywhere glittering on the walls, and all the rest of the glorious show; if
from thence he had led thee back afterward to a poor man's hut, and
promised that in a short time he would bring thee back to those palaces,
and world there give thee a perpetual mansion; tell me, wouldest thou not
indeed languish with desire, and feel impatient, even at these few days?
Thus think then of heaven, and of earth, and groan with Paul, not because
of death, but because of the present life!

6. But grant me, saith one, to be like Paul, and I shall never be afraid of
death. Why, what is it that forbids thee, O man, to become like Paul? Was
he not a poor man? Was he not a tent maker? Was he not a man of humble
position? For if he had been rich and high born, the poor, when called
upon to imitate his zeal, would have had their poverty to plead; but now
thou canst say nothing of this sort. For this man was one who exercised a
manual art, and supported himself too by his daily labors. And thou,
indeed, from the first hast inherited true religion from thy fathers; and
from thy earliest age hast been nourished in the study of the sacred
writings; but he was "a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious," and

ravaged the Church! Nevertheless, he so changed all at once, as to surpass
all in the vehemence of his zeal, and he cries out, saying, "Be ye imitators
of me, even as I also am of Christ." He imitated the Lord; and wilt not
thou who hast been educated in piety from the first, imitate a
fellow-servant; one who by conversion was brought to the faith at a later
period of life? Knowest thou not, that they who are in sins are dead whilst
they live; and that they who live in righteousness, although they be dead,
yet they live? And this is not my word. It is the declaration of Christ
speaking to Martha, "He that believeth in me though he were dead yet
shall he live." Is our doctrine, indeed, a fable? If thou art a Christian,
believe in Christ; if thou believest in Christ, shew me thy faith by thy
works. But how mayest thou shew this? By thy contempt of death: for in
this we differ from the unbelievers. They may well fear death; since they
have no hope of a resurrection. But thou, who art traveling toward better
things, and hast the opportunity of meditating on the hope of the future;
what excuse hast thou, if whilst assured of a resurrection, thou are yet at
the same time as fearful of death, as those who believe not the
resurrection?

7. But I have no fear of death, says one, nor of the act of dying, but of a
miserable death, of being beheaded. Did John then, I ask, die miserably?
for he was beheaded. Or did Stephen die miserably? for he was stoned; and
all the martyrs have thus died wretchedly, according to this objection:
since some have ended their lives by fire; and others by the sword; and
some cast into the ocean; others down a precipice; and others into the jaws
of wild beasts, have so come by their death. To die basely, O man, is not
to come to one's end by a violent death, but to die in sin! Hear, at least,
the prophet moralizing on this very matter, and saying, "The death of
sinners is evil." He does not say that a violent death is evil; but what then?
"The death of sinners is evil." And justly so; for after the departure from
this life, there is an intolerable punishment; undying vengeance, the
envenomed worm; the fire unquenchable, the outer darkness, the chains
indissoluble; the gnashing of teeth, the tribulation, and the anguish, and the
eternal justice.

8. Since therefore such evils await sinners, what advantage can it be to
them, though they should end their days at home, and in their bed? Even
so, on the other hand, it can do no harm to the righteous to lay down the

present life through sword, or steel, or fire when they are to depart to the
good things that are immortal. Truly "the death of sinners is evil." Such a
death was that of the rich man, who despised Lazarus. He, when he had
terminated his life by a natural end, at home and on his bed, and with his
relatives about him, experienced after his departure to the other world a
fiery torment; nor was he able to obtain there even a little comfort, out of
all the pleasure he had enjoyed in the present life! But not so was it with
Lazarus; for when lying upon the pavement, while the dogs came and
licked his sores, he had suffered a violent death (for what could be more
painful than hunger?), but on his departing hence he enjoyed eternal
blessings, luxuriating in the bosom of Abraham! In what respect, then, did
it injure him that he died a violent death? or what did it profit the rich man,
that he died not with violence?

9. But, says some one, "We have no fear of dying by violence, but of
dying unjustly; and of being punished in a similar way with the guilty, -
we who have had nothing to do with the crimes of which we are
suspected." What sayest thou, tell me? Art thou afraid of dying unjustly,
and wouldest thou wish to die justly. But who is there so wretched and
miserable, that when he had the alternative of dying unjustly, would rather
depart by an act of justice? For if it be necessary to fear death, it is
necessary to fear it when it comes upon us justly; since he indeed who
dies unjustly, is by this very means made a partaker with all the saints.
For many of those who were approved and distinguished by God, have
been subjected to an unjust end; and first of all Abel. For it was not that he
had sinned against his brother, or done Cain any harm; but inasmuch as he
had honored God, therefore was he slaughtered. But God permitted it.
Was it, think you, because He loved him, or because He hated him? Most
clearly, because He loved him, and wished to make his crown the brighter,
by that most unjust murder. Seest thou then, that it becomes us not to be
afraid of dying by violence; nor yet of dying unjustly; but of dying in a
state of sin? Abel died unjustly. Cain lived, groaning and trembling! Which
then, I would ask, was the more blessed of the two; he who went to rest in
righteousness, or he who lived in sin; he who died unjustly, or he who was
justly punished? Would you have me declare unto your Charity, whence it
is that we are afraid of death? The love of the kingdom hath not penetrated
us, nor the desire of things to come inflamed us: otherwise we should

despise all present things, even as the blessed Paul did. Add to this, on the
other hand, that we do not stand in awe of hell; therefore death is terrible.
We are not sensible of the unsufferable nature of the punishment there;
therefore, instead of sin, we fear death; since if the fear of the one held
possession of our souls, the fear of the other would not be able to enter.

10. And this I will endeavor to make manifest, not from anything of a
remote nature, but from what is at our own doors; and from the events
which have happened among us in these days. For when the Emperor's
letter came, ordering that tribute to be imposed which was thought to be
so intolerable, all were in a tumult; all quarreled with it; thought it a sore
grievance, resented it; and when they met one another said, "Our life is not
worth living, the city is undone; - no one will be able to stand under this
heavy burden;" and they were distressed as if placed in the extremest
danger. After this, when the rebellion was actually perpetrated, and certain
vile, yea, thoroughly vile persons, trampling under foot the laws, threw
down the statues, and involved all in the utmost peril; and now that we are
in fear for our very lives, through the indignation of the Emperor, this loss
of money no longer stings us. But instead of such complaints, I hear from
all a language of a different kind. "Let the Emperor take our substance, we
will gladly be deprived of our fields and possessions, if any one will but
ensure us safety for the bare body." As therefore, before the fear of death
pressed upon us, the loss of our wealth tormented us; and after these
lawless outrages had been perpetrated, the fear of death succeeding,
expelled the grief for that loss; so if the fear of hell had held possession of
our souls, the fear of death would not have possessed them. But even as it
is with the body, when two kinds of pain seize upon us, the more
powerful usually overshadows the weaker one, so also would it now
happen; if the dread of future punishment remained in the soul, that would
overshadow all human fear. So that if any one endear-ours always to have
the remembrance of hell, he will deride every kind of death; and this will
not only deliver him from the present distress, but will even rescue him
from the flame to come. For he who is always afraid of hell, will never fall
into the fire of hell; being made sober by this continual fear!

11. Permit me, that I now say to you at a fitting time, "Brethren, be not
children in understanding; howbeit in malice be ye children." For this is a
childish terror of ours, if we fear death, but are not fearful of sin. Little

children too are afraid of masks, but fear not the fire. On the contrary, if
they are carried by accident near a lighted candle, they stretch out the hand
without any concern towards the candle and the flame; yet a mask which
is so utterly contemptible terrifies them; whereas they have no dread of
fire, which is really a thing to be afraid of. Just so we too have a fear of
death, which is a mask that might well be despised; but have no fear of sin,
which is truly dreadful; and, even as fire, devours the conscience! And this
is wont to happen not on account of the nature of the things, but by
reason of our own folly; so that if we were once to consider what death is,
we should at no time be afraid of it. What then, I pray you, is death? Just
what it is to put off a garment. For the body is about the soul as a
garment; and after laying this aside for a short time by means of death, we
shall resume it again with the more splendor. What is death at most? It is a
journey for a season; a sleep longer than usual! So that if thou fearest
death, thou shouldest also fear sleep! If for those who are dying thou art
pained, grieve for those too who are eating and drinking, for as this is
natural, so is that! Let not natural things sadden thee; rather let things
which arise from an evil choice make thee sorrowful. Sorrow not for the
dying man; but sorrow for him who is living in sin!

12. Would you have me mention another reason on account of which we
fear death? We do not live with strictness, nor keep a clear conscience; for
if this were the case nothing would alarm us, neither death, nor famine, nor
the loss of wealth, nor anything else of this kind. For he who lives
virtuously, cannot be injured by any of these things, or be deprived of his
inward pleasure. For being supported by favorable hopes, nothing will be
able to throw him into dejection. What is there that any one can possibly
effect, by which he can cause the noble-minded man to become sorrowful?
Take away his riches? He has yet wealth that is in the heavens! Cast him
out of his country? He will take his journey to that city which is above!
Load him with fetters? He has still his conscience free, and is insensible to
the external chain! Put his body to death? Yet he shall rise again! And as
he who fights with a shadow, and beaten the air, will be unable to hit any
one; so he who is at war with the just man, is but striking at a shadow, and
wasting his own strength, without being able to inflict any injury upon
him. Grant me then to be sure of the kingdom of heaven; and, if thou
wishest, slay me this day. I shall be thankful to thee for the slaughter;

forasmuch as thou sendest me quickly to the possession of those good
things! "This, however," says some one, "is what we especially lament,
that hindered as we are by the multitude of our sins, we shall not attain to
that kingdom." Such being the case then, leave off lamenting death, and
lament thy sins, in order that thou mayest be freed from them! Grief,
indeed, hath had its existence, not that we should sorrow for the loss of
wealth, nor for death, nor for anything else of that kind, but that we may
employ it for the taking away of our sins. And I will make the truth of this
evident by an example. Healing medicines have been made for those
diseases only which they are able to remove; not for those which are in no
respect assisted by them. For instance (for I wish to make the matter still
plainer), the medicine which is able to benefit a malady of the eyes only,
and no other disease, one might justly say was made only for the sake of
the eyes; not for the stomach, nor for the hands, nor any other member.
Let us then transfer this argument to the subject of grief; and we shall find,
that in none of those things which happen to us, is it of any advantage,
except to correct sin; whence it is apparent that it hath had its existence
only for the destruction of this. Let us now take a survey of each of those
evils which befall us, and let us apply despondency as a remedy, and see
what sort of advantage results from it.

13. Some one is mulcted in property: he becomes sad, but this does not
make good his loss. Some one hath lost a son: he grieves, but he cannot
raise the dead, nor benefit the departed. Some one hath been scourged,
beaten, and insulted; he becomes sorrowful. This does not recall the insult.
Some one falls into sickness, and a most grievous disease; he is dejected.
This does not remove his disease, but only makes it the more grievous. Do
you see that in none of these cases does sadness answer any useful
purpose? Suppose that any one hath sinned, and is sad. He blots out the
sin; he gets free from the transgression. How is this shewn? By the
declaration of the Lord; for, speaking of a certain one who had sinned, He
said, "Because of his iniquity I made him sad for a while; and I saw that he
was grieved, and he went on heavily; and I healed his ways." Therefore
also Paul saith, "Godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation not to
be repented of." Since then what I have said clearly shews, that neither the
loss of riches, nor insult, nor abuse, nor stripes, nor sickness, nor death,
nor any other thing of that kind can possibly be relieved by the

interference of grief, but sin only can it blot out and do away, it is evident
that this is the only reason why it hath its existence. Let us therefore no
more grieve for the loss of wealth, but let us grieve only when we commit
sin. For great in this case is the gain that comes of sorrow. Art thou
amerced? Be not dejected, for thus thou wilt not be at all benefited. Hast
thou sinned? Then be sorry: for it is profitable; and consider the skill and
wisdom of God. Sin hath brought forth for us these two things, sorrow
and death. For "in the day thou eatest," He saith, "thou shall surely die;"
and to the woman, "In sorrow thou shall bring forth children." And by
both of these things he took away sin, and provided that the mother
should be destroyed by her offspring. For that death as well as grief takes
away sin, is evident, in the first place, from the case of the martyrs; and it
is plain too from what Paul saith to those who had sinned, speaking on
this wise, "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
sleep." Inasmuch, he observes, as ye have sinned, ye die, so that ye are
freed from sin by death. Therefore he goes on to say, "For if we would
judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are
chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
And even as the worm is brought forth from the wood, and devours the
wood; and a moth consumes the wool, from whence it originates; so grief
and death were born of sin, and devour sin.

14. Let us not then fear death, but let us only fear sin, and grieve on
account of this. And these things I speak, not anticipating any thing
fearful, God forbid! but wishing you when alarmed to be always thus
affected, and to fulfill the law of Christ in very deed. For "he," saith
Christ, "that taketh not his cross, and followeth after Me, is not worthy
of Me." This He said, not that we should bear the wood upon our
shoulders, but that we should always have death before our eyes. Even so
as Paul, that is, died daily, and laughed at death, and despised the present
life. For indeed thou art a soldier, and standest continually at arms; but a
soldier who is afraid of death, will never perform a noble action. Thus then
neither will a Christian man, if fearful of dangers, perform anything great
or admirable; nay, besides this, he will be apt to be easily vanquished. But
not so is it with the man who is bold and lofty minded. He remains
impregnable and unconquerable. As then the Three Children, when they
feared not the fire, escaped from the fire, so also we, if we fear not death,

shall entirely escape from death. They feared not the fire (for it is no crime
to be burnt), but they feared sin, for it is a crime to commit impiety. Let
us also imitate these and all such, and let us not be afraid of dangers, and
then we shall pass safely through them.

15. As for me, "I am not a prophet nor the son of a prophet," yet I
understand clearly thus much of the future, and I proclaim, both loudly
and distinctly, that if we become changed, and bestow some care upon our
souls, and desist from iniquity, nothing will be unpleasant or painful. And
this I plainly know from the love of God toward man, as well as from
those things which He hath done for men, and cities, and nations, and
whole populations. For He threatened the city of Nineveh, and said,
"There are yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown." What then, I
ask, Was Nineveh overthrown? Was the city destroyed? Nay, quite the
contrary; it both arose, and became still more distinguished; and long as is
the time which has elapsed, it has not effaced its glory, but we all still
celebrate and admire it even to this day. For from that time it hath been a
sort of excellent haven for all who have sinned, not suffering them to sink
into desperation, but calling all to repentance; and by what it did, and by
what it obtained of God's favor, persuading men never to despair of their
salvation, but exhibiting the best life they can, and setting before them a
good hope, to be confident of the issue as destined in any wise to be
favorable. For who would not be stirred up on hearing of such an example,
even if he were the laziest of mortals?

16. For God even preferred that His own prediction should fall to the
ground, so that the city should not fall. Or rather, the prophecy did not
even so fall to the ground. For if indeed while the men continued in the
same wickedness, the sentence had not taken effect, some one perhaps
might have brought a charge against what was uttered. But if when they
had changed, and desisted from their iniquity, God also desisted from His
wrath, who shall be able any longer to find fault with the prophecy, or to
convict the things spoken of falsehood. The same law indeed which God
had laid down from the beginning, publishing it to all men by the prophet,
was on that occasion strictly observed. What then is this law? "I shall
speak a sentence," saith He, "concerning a nation or a kingdom, to pluck
up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; and it shall be, that if they repent
of their evil, I will also repent (cid:229)
 of the wrath which I said I would do unto

them." Guarding then this law, he saved those who were converted and
released from His wrath those who desisted from their wickedness. He
knew the virtue of the barbarians; therefore He hastened the prophet
thither. Thus was the city agitated at the time, when it heard the prophet's
voice, but instead of being injured it was benefited by fear. For that fear
was the cause of its safety. The threatening effected the deliverance from
the peril. The sentence of overthrow put a stop to the overthrow. O
strange and astonishing event! the sentence threatening death, brought
forth life! The sentence after it was published became canceled; the very
opposite to that which takes place among temporal judges! for in their
case the proclamation of the sentence causes it to become valid, is fully to
ratify it; but on the contrary, with God, the publication of the sentence,
caused it to be canceled. For if it had not been published, the offenders
would not have heard; and if they had not heard, they would not have
repented, and if they had not repented, they would not have warded off
the punishment, nor would they have obtained that astonishing
deliverance. For how is it less than astonishing, when the judge declares
sentence, and the condemned discharge the sentence by their repentance!
They, indeed, did not flee from the city as we are now doing, but
remaining in it they caused it to stand. It was a snare, and they made it a
fortification! It was a gulf, and a precipice, and they turned it into a tower
of safety! They had heard that the buildings would fall, and yet they fled
not from the buildings, but they fled from their sins. They did not depart
each from his house as we do now, but each departed from his evil way;
for, said they, "why should we think the walls have brought forth the
wrath? we are the causes of the wound; we then should provide the
medicine." Therefore they trusted for safety, not to a change of
habitations, but of habits.

17. Thus did the barbarians! and are we not ashamed, and ought we not to
hide our faces, whilst instead of changing our habits, as they did, we
change only our habitations; privily removing our goods, and doing the
deeds of men that are drunken? Our Master is angry with us; and we,
neglecting to appease His wrath, carry about our household stuff from
place to place, and run hither and thither, seeking where we may deposit
our substance; while we ought rather to seek where we may deposit our
soul in safety; or rather, it behoveth us not to seek, but to entrust its

safety to virtue and uprightness of life. For when we were angry and
displeased with a servant, if he, instead of defending himself against our
displeasure, went down to his apartment, and collecting together his
clothes, and binding up together all his movables, meditated a flight, we
could not tamely put up with this contempt. Let us then desist from this
unseasonable endeavor, and let us each say to God, "Whither shall I go
from Thy Spirit, and whither shall I flee from Thy presence?" Let us
imitate the spiritual wisdom of the barbarians. They repented even on
uncertain grounds! For the sentence had no such clause, "If ye turn and
repent, I will set up the city;" but simply, "Yet three days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown." What then said they? "Who knoweth whether God
will repent of the evil He said He would do unto us?" Who knoweth?
They know not the end of the event, and yet they do not neglect
repentance! They are unacquainted with God's method of shewing mercy,
and yet they change upon the strength of uncertainties! For neither was it
in their power to look at other Ninevites who had repented and been
saved; nor had they read prophets; nor had they heard patriarchs; nor had
they enjoyed counsel, or partaken of admonition; nor had they persuaded
themselves that they should certainly propitiate God by repentance. For
the threatening did not imply this: but they were doubtful, and hesitating
concerning it; and yet they repented with all diligence. What reason then
shall we have to urge, when those, who had no ground for confidence as to
the issue, are seen to have exhibited so great a change; but thou who hast
ground of confidence in the mercy of God, and who hast frequently
received many pledges of His care, and hast heard prophets, and apostles,
and hast been instructed by actual events; hast yet no emulation to reach
the same measure of virtue as these did! Great assuredly was their virtue!
but greater by far was the mercy of God! and this may be seen from the
very greatness of the threat. For this reason God did not add to the
declaration, "But if ye repent. I will spare:" in order that by setting forth a
sentence without limitation, He might increase the fear and having
increased the fear, He might constrain them more speedily to repentance.

18. The prophet is indeed ashamed, fore-seeing what the issue would be,
and conjecturing that what he had prophesied, would remain
unaccomplished; God however is not ashamed, but is desirous of one thing
only, viz. the salvation of men, and corrects His own servant. For when he

had entered the ship, He straightway there raised a boisterous sea; in order
that thou mightest know that where sin is, there is a tempest; where there
is disobedience, there is the swelling of e waves. The city was shaken
because of the sins of the Ninevites; and the ship was shaken because of
the disobedience of the prophet. The sailors therefore threw Jonah in the
deep, and the ship was preserved. Let us then drown our sins, and our city
will assuredly be safe! Flight will certainly be no advantage to us; for it did
not profit him; on the contrary, it did him injury. He fled from the land
indeed, but he fled not from the wrath of God; he fled from the land, but
he brought the tempest after him on the sea; and so far was he from
obtaining any benefit by his flight, that he plunged those also who received
him into the extremest peril. And whilst he sat sailing in the ship, although
the sailors, the pilots, and all the necessary apparatus of the ship were
there present, he was placed in the utmost danger. After, however, having
been thrown out into the deep, and having put away his sin by means of
the punishment, he had been conveyed into that unstable vessel, I mean,
the whale's belly, he enjoyed great security. This was for the purpose of
teaching thee, that as no ship can be of any use to him who is living in sin,
so him who has put away his sin, the sea cannot drown, nor monsters
destroy. Of a truth, the waves received, but they did not suffocate him.
The whale received him, but did not destroy him; but both the animal and
the element gave back to God unhurt that, with which they were
entrusted; and by all these things the prophet was taught to be humane
and merciful; and not to be more cruel than wild beasts, or thoughtless
sailors, or unruly waves. For even the sailors did not immediately at first
give him up, but after much compulsion; and the sea and the monster
guarded him with great kindness; all these things being under God's
direction.

19. Therefore he came back again; he preached; he threatened; he
persuaded; he preserved; he affrighted; he amended; he established; by one,
and that the first preaching! Many days he needed not, nor continued
counsel; but speaking these simple words only, he brought all to
repentance! On this account God did not lead him directly from the ship
into the city; but the sailors committed him to the sea; the sea to the
whale; the whale to God; God to the Ninevites; and by this long circuit he
brought back the fugitive, that he might instruct all, that it is impossible to

fly from the hands of God; that whithersoever any one may roam, dragging
his sin after him, he will have to undergo a thousand evils; and though no
mortal were present, yet on every side the whole creation will rise up
against him with the utmost vehemence! Let us not then provide for our
safety by flight, but by a change of the moral character. Is it for remaining
in the city that God is angry with thee, that thou shouldest fly? It is
because thou hast sinned, that He is indignant. Lay aside therefore the sin,
and where the cause of thy wound lies, thence remove the fountain of the
evil. For the physicians too give us directions to cure contraries by
contraries. Is fever, for instance, produced by a full diet? They subject the
disease to the regimen of abstinence. Does any one fall sick from sadness?
They say that mirth is the suitable medicine for it. Thus also it befits us to
act with respect to diseases of the soul. Hath listlessness excited the
wrath? let us shake this off by zeal, and let us manifest in our conduct a
great change. We have the fast, a very great auxiliary and ally in our
warfare; and besides the fast, we have the impending distress, and the fear
of danger. Now then, in season, let us be at work on the soul; for we shall
easily be able to persuade it to whatever we choose; since he who is
alarmed and trembling, and set free from all luxury, and who lives in terror,
is able to practice moral wisdom without difficulty, and to receive the
seeds of virtue with much alacrity.

20. Let us therefore persuade it to make this first change for the better, by
the avoidance of oaths; for although I spake to you yesterday. and the day
before, on this same subject; yet neither today, nor tomorrow, nor the day
after, will I desist giving my counsel on this subject. And why do I say
tomorrow and the day following? Until I see that you are amended, I will
not abstain from doing so. If those, indeed, who transgress this law, are
not ashamed, far less should we who bid them not transgress it, feel this
frequency of the admonition to be a matter worthy of shame. For to be
continually reminding men of the same topics is not the fault of the
speaker, but of the hearers, needing as they do perpetual instruction, upon
simple and easily-observed precepts. What indeed is easier than not to
swear? It is only a good work of habit. It is neither labor of the body, nor
expenditure of wealth. Art thou desirous to learn how it is possible to get
the better of this infirmity, how it is possible to be set free from this evil
habit? I will tell thee of a particular method by which if pursued thou wilt

certainly master it. If thou seest either thyself or any other person,
whether it be one of thy servants, or of thy children, or thy wife, ensnared
in this vice; when thou hast continually reminded them of it, and they are
not amended, order them to retire to rest supperless; and impose this
sentence upon thyself, as well as upon them, a sentence which will bring
with it no injury, but a gain. For such is the nature of spiritual acts; they
bring profit and a speedy reformation. The tongue when constantly
punished, when straitened by thirst. and pained by hunger, receives a
sufficient admonition, even whilst no one is its monitor; and though we
were the most stupid of mortals, yet when we are thus reminded by the
greatness of the punishment during a whole day, we shall need no other
counsel and exhortation.

21. Ye have applauded what I have spoken. But still shew me your
applause too by deeds. Else what is the advantage of our meeting here?
Suppose a child were to go to school every day, yet if he learnt nothing
the more for it, would the excuse satisfy us that he every day went there?
Should we not esteem it the greatest fault, that going there daily, he did it
to no purpose. Let us consider this with ourselves, and let us say to
ourselves, For so long a time have we met together at church, having the
benefit of a most solemn Communion, which has in it much profit; and
should we return back again just as we came, with none of our defects
corrected, of what advantage is our coming here? For most actions are
done, not for themselves, but for the effects which follow through their
means; as, for example, the sower does not sow for the mere sake of
sowing, but in order that he may reap too; since if this were not to follow,
the sowing would be a loss, the seeds rotting without any kind of
advantage. The merchant doth not take a voyage merely for sailing's sake,
but that he may increase his substance by going abroad; since, if this be
not attained beside, extreme mischief will result, and the voyage of
merchants were but for loss. Let us indeed consider this in relation to
ourselves. We also meet together in the church, not for the mere purpose
of spending time here, but in order that we may return having gained a
great and spiritual benefit. Should we then depart empty, and without
having received any advantage, this our diligence becomes our
condemnation! In order that this may not occur, and extreme mischief
result, on departing from this place, let friends practice with one another;

fathers with children; and masters with servants; and train yourselves to
perform the task assigned you; so that when ye come back again, and hear
us giving you counsel on the same subjects, ye may not be put to shame
by an accusing conscience, but may rejoice. and be glad, whilst ye perceive
that ye have accomplished the greatest part of the admonition.

22. Let us not moralize on these things here only. For this temporary
admonition does not suffice to extirpate the whole evil; but at home also,
let the husband hear of these things from the wife, and the wife from the
husband. And let there be a kind of rivalry among all in endeavoring to gain
precedence in the fulfillment of this law; and let him who is in advance,
and hath amended his conduct, reproach him who is still loitering behind;
to the end that he may stir him up the more by these gibes. He who is
deficient, and hath not yet amended his conduct, let him look at him who
hath outstripped him, and strive with emulation to come up with him
quickly. If we take advice on these points, and are anxiously concerned
about them, our other affairs will speedily be well adjusted. Be thou
solicitous about God's business, and he will take care of thine! And do not
say to me, "What if any one should impose upon us the necessity of
taking oaths? What if he should not believe us?" For assuredly, where a
law is transgressed, it is improper to make mention of necessity;
forasmuch as there is but one necessity which cannot be dispensed with,
viz. that of not offending God! This, however, I say further; cut off in the
meantime superfluous oaths, those that are taken uselessly, and without
any necessity; those to your own family, those to your friends, those to
your servants; and should you take away these, you will have no further
need of me for the others. For the very mouth that has been well
disciplined to dread and to avoid the frequent oath, should any one
constrain it a thousand times, would never consent to relapse again into
the same habit. On the contrary, as now, with much labor and vast
importunity, by alarming, threatening, exhorting, and counseling, we have
scarcely been able to bring it over to a different habit, so in that case,
although any one were to impose ever so great necessity, he could not
possibly persuade to a transgression of this law. And as a person would
never choose to take a particular poison, however urgent the necessity
might be, so neither would he to utter an oath!

23. Should this amendment then take place, it will be an encouragement
and inducement to the attainment of the remaining parts of virtue. For he
who has not accomplished anything at all becomes listless, and (cid:229)
 quickly
falls; but he who is conscious with himself that he has fulfilled at least one
precept, coming by this to have a good hope, will go on with greater
alacrity towards the rest; so that, after he has reached one, he will
presently come to another; and will not halt until he has attained the
crown of all. For if with regard to wealth, the more any one obtains of it,
the more he desires, much rather may this be seen with reference to
spiritual attainments. Therefore I hasten, and am urgent that this work
may take its commencement, and that the foundation of virtue may be laid
in your souls. We pray and beseech, that ye will remember these words,
not only at the present time, but also at home, and in the market, and
wheresoever ye pass your time. Oh! that it were possible for me familiarly
to converse with you! then this long harangue of mine would have been
unnecessary. But now since this may not be, instead of me, remember my
words: and while you are sitting at table, suppose me to enter, and to be
standing beside you, and dinning into you the things I now say to you in
this place. And wheresoever there may be any discourse concerning me
among you, above all things remember this precept, and render me this
recompense far my love toward you. If I see that you have fulfilled it, I
have received my full return, and have obtained a sufficient recompense for
my labors. In order then that ye may both render us the more active, and
that yourselves too may be in the enjoyment of a good hope; and may
provide for the accomplishment of the remaining precepts with greater
facility; treasure up this precept in your souls with much care, and ye will
then understand the benefit of this admonition. And since a vestment
broidered with gold is a beautiful and conspicuous object, but seems much
more so to us when it is worn upon our own person; thus also the
precepts of God are beautiful when being praised, but appear far more
lovely when they are rightly practiced. For now indeed ye commend what
is spoken during a brief moment of time, but if ye reduce it to practice,
you will alike commend both yourselves and us all day long, and all your
lives long. And this is not the grand point, that we shall praise one
another; but that God will accept us; and not only accept us, but will also
reward us with those gifts that are great and unspeakable! Of which may
we all be deemed worthy, through the grace and lovingkindness of our

Lord Jesus Christ, through whom, and with whom, to the Father together
with the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and always, for ever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 6

This Homily is intended to shew that the fear of Magistrates is
beneficial. It also contains an account of what occurred, during
their journey, to those who were conveying the tidings of the
sedition to the Emperor. The case of Jonah is further cited in
illustration. The exhortation on the fear of death is here continued;
and it is shewn, that he who suffers unjustly, and yet gives thanks to
God, by whose permission it happens, is as one suffering for God's
sake. Examples are again adduced from the history of the Three
Children, and the Babylonian furnace. The Homily concludes with
an address on the necessity of abstaining from oaths.

1. WE have spent many days addressing words of comfort to your
Charity. We would not, however, on that account lay the subject aside;
but as long as the sore of despondency remains, we will apply to it the
medicine of consolation. For if in the case of bodily wounds, physicians
do not give over their fomentations, until they perceive that the pain has
subsided; much less ought this to be done in regard to the soul.
Despondency is a sore of the soul; and we must therefore foment it
continually with soothing words. For not so naturally is warm water
efficacious to soften a hard tumor of the flesh, as words of comfort are
powerful to allay the swelling passions of the soul. Here, there is no need
of the sponge as with physician, but instead of this we employ the tongue.
No need of fire here, that we may warm the water; but instead of fire, we
make use of the grace of the Spirit. Suffer us then to do so today. For if we
were not to comfort you, where else could ye obtain consolation? The
judges affright; the priests therefore must console The rulers threaten;
therefore must the Church give comfort! Thus it happens with respect to
little children. The teachers frighten them, and send them away weeping to
their mothers; but the mothers receiving them back to their own bosoms,
keep them there, embrace them, and kiss them, while they wipe away their
tears, and relieve their sorrowing spirits; persuading them by what they
say, that it is profitable for them to fear their teachers. Since therefore the
rulers also make you afraid, and render you anxious, the Church, which is
the common mother of us all, opening her bosom, and cradling us in her

arms, administers daily consolation; telling us that the fear of rulers is
profitable, and profitable too the consolation that comes from hence. For
the fear of the former does not permit us to be relaxed by listlessness, but
the consolation of the latter does not allow us to sink under the weight of
sadness; and by both these means God provides for our safety. He
Himself hath armed magistrates with power; that they may strike terror
into the licentious; and hath ordained His priests that they may administer
consolation to those that are in sorrow.

2. And both these things are taught us by the Scripture, and by actual
experience of recent events. For if, whilst there are magistrates and soldiers
living under arms, the madness of a few individuals, a motley crew of
adventurers, hath kindled such a fire among us, in so short a moment of
time, and raised such a tempest, and made us all to stand in fear of
shipwreck, suppose the fear of magistrates to be wholly taken away? To
what lengths would they not have gone in their madness? Would they not
have overthrown the city from its foundations, turning all things upside
down, and have taken our very lives? If you were to abolish the public
tribunals, you would abolish all order from our life. And even as if you
deprive the ship of its pilot, you sink the vessel; or as, if you remove the
general from the army, you place the soldiers bound in the hands of the
enemy; so if you deprive the city of its rulers, we must lead a life less
rational than that of the brutes, biting and devouring one another; the rich
man, the poorer; the stronger man, the weaker; and the bolder man, him
who is more gentle. But now by the grace of God none of these things
happen. For they who live in a state of piety, require no correction on the
part of the magistrates; for "the law is not made for a righteous man," saith
one. But the more numerous being viciously inclined, if they had no fear of
these hanging over them, would fill the cities with innumerable evils; which
Paul knowing, observed, "There is no power, but of God, the powers that
be are ordained of God." For what the tie-beams are in houses, that rulers
are in cities; and in the same manner as if you were to take away the
former, the walls, being disunited, would fall in upon one another of their
own accord; so were you to deprive the world of magistrates, and of the
fear that comes of them, houses at once, and cities, and nations, would fall
on one another in unrestrained confusion, there being no one to repress, or
repel, or persuade them to be peaceful, by the fear of punishment!

3. Let us not then be grieved, beloved, by the fear of our rulers, but let us
give thanks to God that He hath removed our listlessness, and rendered us
more diligent. For tell me, what harm hath arisen from this concern and
anxiety? Is it that we are become more grave, and gentle; more diligent, and
attentive? that we see no one intoxicated, and singing lascivious airs? Or is
it that there are continual supplications, and prayers, and tears? that
unseasonable laughter, and impure words, and all dissoluteness is
banished; and that the city is now in all respects, like the pattern of a
modest and virtuous woman? Dost thou grieve, I ask, for any of these
reasons? For these things, assuredly, it were right to rejoice, and to be
thankful to God, that by the terror of a few days He hath put an end to
such stupidity!

"Very true," saith some one, "if our danger did not go beyond fear, we
should have reaped a sufficient benefit; but we are now in dread lest the
mischief should proceed much farther, and we should be all placed in the
extremest peril."

Nevertheless, I say, fear not. Paul comforteth you, saying, "God is
faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but
will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that ye may be able
to bear it." He indeed Himself hath said. "I will never leave thee, nor
forsake thee." For had He resolved to punish us in deed, and in actual
endurance, He would not have given us over to terror during so many
days. For when He would not punish, He affrights; since if He were
intending to punish, fear would be superfluous, and threatening
superfluous. But now, we have sustained a life more grievous than
countless deaths; fearing and trembling during so many days, and being
suspicious of our very shadows; and paying the punishment of Cain; and
in the midst of our sleep, starting up, through constant agony of mind. So
that if we have kindled God's wrath, we have appeased Him in the
endurance of such a punishment. For if we have not paid the satisfaction
due to our sins, yet it hath been enough to satisfy the mercy of God.

4. But not this, but many other grounds for confidence ought we to have.
For God hath already given us not a few pledges for favorable hopes. And
first of all, those who carried the evil tidings departing hence with the
speed of wings, supposing they should long ere this have reached the

camp, are yet delayed in the midst of their journey. So many hindrances
and impediments have arisen; and they have left their horses, and are now
proceeding in vehicles; whence their arrival must of necessity be retarded.
For since God here stirred up our priest, and common father, and
persuaded him to go forth, and undertake this embassy, he detained the
messengers for a while, when they were but half way on their road, lest
arriving before him they might kindle the fire, and make our teacher's
efforts to mend matters useless, when the royal ears had become inflamed.
For that this hindrance on the road, was not without God's interposition
is evident from this. Men who had been familiar with such journeys all
their lives, and whose constant business it was to ride on horseback, now
broke down through the fatigue of this very riding; so that what hath now
happened is the reverse of what took place in the case of Jonah. For God
hastened him when unwilling, to go on his mission. But these, who were
desirous to go, He hindered. O strange and wonderful event! He wished
not to preach of an overthrow; and God forced him to go against his will.
These men with much haste set forward to be the bearers of a message of
overthrow, and against their will again He has hindered them! For what
reason think you? Why, because in this case the haste was an injury; but
in the other case, haste brought gain. On this account, He hastened him
forward by means of the whale; and detained these by means of their
horses. Seest thou the wisdom of God? Through the very means by which
each party hoped to accomplish their object, through these each received
an hindrance. Jonah expected to escape by the ship, and the ship became
his chain. These couriers, by means of their horses, expected the more
quickly to see the Emperor; and the horses became the obstacles; or rather,
neither the horses in one case, nor the ship in the other, but the Providence
of God everywhere directing all things according to its own wisdom!

5. Consider also His care over us, and how He both affrighted and
consoled us. For after permitting them to set out on the very day when all
these outrages were committed as if they would report all that had taken
place to the Emperor; He alarmed us all at their sudden departure. But
when they were gone, and two or three days had elapsed, and we thought
the journey of our Priest would now be useless, as he would arrive when it
was too late, He delivered us from this fear, and comforted us by detaining
them, as I observed, midway; and by providing persons coming to us from

thence by the same road, to announce to us all the difficulties they had met
with on their journey, that we might thus take a little breath, as indeed we
did, and were relieved of a great part of our anxiety. Having heard of this,
we adored God who had done it, who hath even now more tenderly than
any father disposed all things for us, delaying by some invisible power
those evil messengers, and all but saying to them, "Why do ye hasten?
Why do ye press on, when ye are going to overwhelm so great a city? For
are ye the bearers of a good message to the Emperor? Wait there till I have
made ready my servant, as an excellent physician, to come up with you
and anticipate you in your course." But if there was so much of
providential care in the first breaking out of this wound of iniquity, much
more shall we obtain a greater freedom from anxiety, after conversion, after
repentance, after so much fear, after tears and prayers. For Jonah was very
properly constrained, in order that he might be forcibly brought to
repentance; but ye have already given striking evidences of repentance, and
conversion. Therefore, it is necessary that you should receive consolation,
instead of a threatening messenger. For this reason also hath He sent our
common father hence, notwithstanding the many things to hinder it. But if
He had not been tender of our safety, He would not have persuaded him to
this, but would have hindered him, however disposed he might be to
undertake the journey.

6. There is a third reason by which I may possibly persuade you to have
confidence; I mean, the present sacred season, which almost all, even
unbelievers, respect; but to which this our divinely-favored Emperor has
shewn such reverence and honor, as to surpass all the Emperors who have
reigned with a regard for religion before him. As a proof of this, by sending
a letter on these days in honor of the feast, he liberated nearly all those
who were lodged in prison; and this letter our Priest when he arrives will
read to him; and remind him of his own laws, and will say to him, "Do
thou exhort thyself, and remember thine own deeds! Thou hast an example
for thy philanthropy at home! Thou didst choose to forbear from
executing a justifiable slaughter, and wilt thou endure to perpetrate one
that is unjust. Reverencing the feast, thou didst discharge those who had
been convicted and condemned; and wilt thou, I ask, condemn the
innocent, and those who have not committed any violence, and this when
the sacred season is present? That be far from thee, O Emperor! Thou,

speaking by this Epistle to all the cities, didst say, ‘Would it were
possible for me to raise even the dead.' This philanthropy and these
words we now stand in need of. To conquer enemies, doth not render
kings so illustrious, as to conquer wrath and anger; for in the former case,
the success is due to arms and soldiers; but here the trophy is simply thine
own, and thou hast no one to divide with thee the glory of thy moral
wisdom. Thou hast overcome barbarian war, overcome also Imperial
wrath! Let all unbelievers learn that the fear of Christ is able to bridle
every kind of authority. Glorify thy Lord by forgiving the trespasses of
thy fellow-servants; that He also may glorify thee the more; that at the
Day of Judgment, He may bend on thee an Eye merciful and serene, being
mindful of this thy lovingkindness!" This, and much more, he will say, and
will assuredly rescue us from the Emperor wrath. And not only will this
fast be of the greatest assistance to us in influencing the Emperor in our
favor, but also towards enduring what befalls us with fortitude; for we
reap no small consolation from this season. For our very meeting together
daily as we do, and having the benefit of hearing the divine Scriptures; and
beholding each other; and weeping with each other; and praying, and
receiving Benedictions, and so departing home, takes off the chief part of
our distress.

7. Let us, therefore, not despond, nor give ourselves up by reason of our
distress; but let us wait, expecting a favorable issue; and let us give heed to
the things that are now about to be spoken. For it is my purpose to
discourse to you again to day respecting contempt for death. I said to you,
yesterday, that we are afraid of death, not because he is really formidable;
but because the love of the kingdom hath not kindled us, nor the fear of
hell laid hold of us; and because besides this we have not a good
conscience. Are you desirous that I should speak of a fourth reason for
this unseasonable distress, one which is not less, and truer than the rest?
We do not live with the austerity that becometh Christians. On the
contrary, we love to follow this voluptuous and dissolute and indolent life;
therefore also it is but natural that we cleave to present things; since if we
spent this life in fastings, vigils, and poverty of diet, cutting off all our
extravagant desires; setting a restraint upon our pleasures; undergoing the
toils of virtue; keeping the body under like Paul, and bringing it into
subjection; not "making provision for the lusts of the flesh;" and pursuing

the strait and narrow way, we should soon be earnestly desirous of future
things, and eager to be delivered from our present labors. And to prove
that what I say is not untrue, ascend to the tops of the mountains, and
observe the monks who are there; some in sackcloth; some in bonds; some
in fastings; some shut up in darkness. Thou wilt then perceive, that all
these are earnestly desiring death, and calling it rest. For even as the
pugilist is eager to leave the stadium, in order that he may be freed from
wounds; and the wrestler longs for the theater to break up, that he may be
released from his toils; so also he who by the aid of virtue leads a life of
austerity, and mortification, earnestly longs for death in order that he may
be freed from his present labors, and may be able to have full assurance in
regard to the crowns laid up in store, by arriving in the still harbor, and
migrating to the place where there is no further apprehension of
shipwreck. Therefore, also, hath God provided for us a life that is
naturally laborious and troublesome; to the end that being here urged by
tribulation, we may conceive an eager longing for future blessings; for if
now, whilst there are so many sorrows, and dangers, and fears, and
anxieties, surrounding us on all sides, we thus cling to the present life;
when should we ever be desirous of the life to come, if our present
existence were altogether void of grief and misery?

8. Thus also God acted towards the Jews. For wishing to infuse into them
a desire of returning (to Canaan), and to persuade them to hate Egypt, He
permitted them to be distressed by working in clay, and brick-making, that
being oppressed by that weight of toil and affliction, they might cry unto
God respecting their return. For if, indeed when they departed after these
things had happened, they did again remember Egypt, with their hard
slavery, and were urgent to turn back to that former tyranny; what if they
had received no such treatment from these barbarians? when would they
have ever wished to leave that strange land? To the end, therefore, that we
may not be too closely attached to the earth, and grow wretched whilst
gaping after present things, and become unmindful of futurity, God hath
made our lives here full of labor. Let us not then cherish the love of the
present life beyond what is necessary. For what doth it profit us? or what
is the advantage of being closely riveted to the desire of this present state?
Art thou willing to learn in what respect this life is advantageous? It is so,
inasmuch as it is the ground-work and starting point of the life to come;

the wrestling-school and the arena for crowns of victory hereafter! so that
if it does not provide these for us, it is worse than a thousand deaths. For
if we do not wish to live so as to please God, it is better to die. For what
is the gain? What have we the more? Do we not every day see the same
sun, and the same moon, the same winter, the same summer, the same
course of things? "The thing that hath been, shall be; and that which is
done, is that which shall be done." Let us not then at once pronounce
those happy, who are alive, and bewail the dead, but let us weep for those
who are in their sins, whether they be dead or alive. And on the other
hand, let us call those happy in whatsoever condition they be, who are in a
state of righteousness. Thou, forsooth, fearest and lamentest "one" death;
but Paul, who was dying daily, was so far from shedding a tear on that
account, that he rejoiced and exulted!

9. "O that I did endure the peril for God," saith some one, "then I should
have no anxiety!" But do not even now sink into despondency; for not
only indeed is he well approved, who suffers in the cause of God: but he
who is suffering any thing unjustly: and bearing it nobly, and giving thanks
to God who permits it, is not inferior to him who sustains these trials for
God's sake. The blessed Job is a proof of this, who received so many
intolerable wounds through the devil's plotting against him uselessly,
vainly, and without cause. Yet, nevertheless, because he bore them
courageously, and gave thanks to God who permitted them, he was
invested with a perfect crown. Be not sad then on account of death; for it
is natural to die: but grieve for sin; because it is a fault of the will. But if
thou grievest for the dead, mourn also for those who are born into the
world; for as the one thing is of nature, so is the other too of nature.
Should any one, therefore, threaten thee with death, say to him, "I am
instructed by Christ not to ‘fear them which kill the body, but are not able
to kill the soul.'" Or should he threaten thee with the confiscation of thy
goods, say to him, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
shall I return thither. We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain
we can carry nothing out." "And though thou take me not, death will come
and take me; and though thou slay me not, yet the law of nature will
presently interfere and bring the end." Therefore we should fear none of
these things which are brought on us by the order of nature, but those
which are engendered by our own evil will; for these bring forth our

penalty. But let us continually consider this, that as regards the events
which come upon us unexpectedly we shall not mend them by grieving,
and so we shall cease to grieve.

10. And moreover we should think of this again, that if we suffer any evil
unjustly, during the present life, we discharge a multitude of sins.
Therefore it is a great advantage to have out the chastisement of our sins
here, and not there; for the rich man received no evil here, and therefore he
was scorched in the flames there; and that this was the reason why he did
not enjoy any consolation, hear in proof what Abraham saith, "Son, thou
hast received thy good things; therefore thou art tormented." But that to
the good things bestowed on Lazarus, not only his virtue, but his having
here suffered a thousand ills, contributed, learn also from the patriarch's
words. For having said to the rich man, "Thou hast received thy good
things," he goes on to say, "and Lazarus evil things, and for this reason he
is comforted." For as they who live virtuously, and are afflicted, receive a
double reward from God, so he who liveth in wickedness, and fares
sumptuously, shall have a double punishment. Again, I declare this not for
the purpose of accusing those who have taken flight, for it is said, "Add
not more trouble to a heart that is vexed;" nor do I say it because I wish to
rebuke; (for the sick man stands in need of consolation); but for the
purpose of endeavoring to promote an amendment. Let us not entrust our
safety to flight, but flee from sins, and depart from our evil way. If we
escape from these things, although we be in the midst of ten thousand
soldiers; not one of them will be able to smite us; but not flying from
these, though we ascend to the very summit of the mountains, we shall
there find innumerable enemies! Let us again call to mind those three
children, who were in the midst of the furnace, yet suffered no evil, and
those who cast them into it, how they that sat around were all consumed.
What is more wonderful than this? The fire freed those it held possession
of, and violently seized those whom it did not hold, to teach thee, that not
the habitation, but the habit of life, bringeth safety or punishment. Those
within the furnace escaped, but those without were consumed. To each
alike were the same bodies, but not the same dispositions. For this reason
neither were the effects on them the same; for hay, although it lie without
the flame, is quickly kindled; but gold, although it remain within, becomes
the more resplendent!

11. Where now are those who said, "Let the Emperor take all, and grant us
our bodies free?" Let such go and learn what is a free body. It is not
immunity from punishment that makes the body free, but perseverance in
a life of righteousness. The bodies of these youths, for instance, were free,
though they were given over to the furnace, because they had before put
off the slavery of sin. For this alone is liberty; and not an immunity from
punishment, or from suffering. anything fearful. But having heard of the
furnace, call thou to mind the "rivers of fire," which there shall be in that
fearful day. For as on the above occasion, the fire seized upon some, but
reverenced others, so also shall it be with those rivers. If any one should
then have hay, wood, stubble, he increases the fire; but if he has gold and
silver, he becomes the brighter. Let us therefore get together this kind of
material, and let us bear the present state of things nobly; knowing that
this tribulation will both bring us deliverance from that punishment if we
understand how to practice true wisdom, and will also make us better here;
and not only us, but often those too, who throw us into trouble, if we be
vigilant; so abundant is the force of this spiritual wisdom; which was the
case then even with the tyrant. For when he knew that they had suffered
no harm, hear how he changed his language. "Ye servants of the most high
God, come forth, and come hither." Didst not thou say, a little before
"Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?" What hath
happened? Whence this change? Thou sawest those without destroyed,
and dost thou call on those within? Whence hath it come to pass that thou
art grown wise in such matters. Thou seest how great a change took place
in the monarch! Whilst he had not yet exercised his power over them, he
blasphemed, but as soon as he had cast them into fire, he began to shew
moral wisdom. For this reason also God permitted all to take place,
whatsoever the tyrant wished, in order that He might make it manifest,
that none will be able to injure those who are kept by Him. And what He
did towards Job, He performed here. For on that occasion also, He
permitted the devil to manifest all his power; and not till he had exhausted
all his darts, and no further mode of plotting against him remained, was the
combatant led out of the field, that the victory might be brilliant and
indubitable. So here too He did the very same thing. He willed to
overthrow their city, and God stayed him not: he willed to carry them
away captive, and He hindered him not: he willed to bind them, and He
permitted; to cast them into the furnace, and He allowed it: to heat the

flame beyond its measure, and this too He suffered; and when there was
nothing further left for the tyrant to do, and he had exhausted all his
strength, then God manifested His own power. and the patience of the
youths. Seest thou how God permitted these tribulations even to the end,
that He might shew the assailants the spiritual wisdom of those whom
they assailed, as well as His own providence. Both of which circumstances
also that man then discerned, and cried out, "Ye servants of the most high
God, come forth, and come hither."

12. But consider thou with me the magnanimity of the youths; for they
neither sprang out before the call, lest some should suppose they feared
the fire; nor when they were called did they remain within, lest any one
should think that they were ambitious and contentious. "As soon," say
they, "as thou hast learnt whose servants we are, as soon as thou hast
acknowledged our Lord, we come forth to be heralds to all who are present
of the power of God." Or rather, not only they themselves, but even the
enemy with his own voice, yea, both orally, and by his epistle, proclaimed
to all men both the constancy of the combatants, and the strength of Him
who presided over the contest. And even as the heralds, when they
proclaim the names of the victorious combatants in the midst of the
theater, mention also the cities to which they belong; "such an one, of such
a city!" So he too, instead of their city, proclaimed their Lord, by saying,
"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God,
come forth, and come hither." What is come to pass, that thou callest them
the servants of God? Were they not thy servants? "Yea," saith he, "but
they have overthrown my sovereignty; they have trampled under foot my
pride. They have shown by deeds, that He is their true Lord. If they were
the servants of men, the fire would not have feared them; the flame would
not have made way for them; for the creation knows nothing of
reverencing or honoring the servants of men." Therefore again he saith,
"Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."

13. Contemplate with me also, how first he proclaims the Arbiter of the
contest. "Blessed be God, who hath sent His angel and delivered His
servants." This of the power of God. He speaks also of the virtue of the
combatants. "Because they trusted in Him, and have changed the king's
word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not worship any God
except their own God." Could anything equal the virtue of this? Before

this, when they said, "We will not serve thy gods," he was inflamed more
fiercely than the very furnace; but now, when by their deeds they had
taught him this, he was so far from being indignant, that he praised and
admired them, for not having obeyed him! So good a thing is virtue, that it
has even its enemies themselves to applaud and admire it! These had
fought and conquered, but the vanquished party gave thanks, that the sight
of the fire had not terrified them, but that the hope in their Lord had
comforted them. And He names the God of the whole world after the three
youths, not at all circumscribing His sovereignty, but inasmuch as these
three youths were equivalent to the whole world. For this reason he both
applauds those who had despised him, and passing by so many governors,
kings, and princes, those who had obeyed him, he stands in admiration of
the three captives and slaves, who derided his tyranny! For they did these
things, not for the sake of contention, but for the love of wisdom; not of
defiance, but of devotion; not as being puffed up with pride, but fired with
zeal. For great indeed is the blessing of a hope in God; which then also the
barbarian learned, and making it manifest that it was from that source they
had escaped the impending peril, he exclaimed aloud: "Because they
trusted in Him!"

14. But I say all this now, and select all the histories that contain trials and
tribulations, and the wrath of kings, and their evil designs, in order that we
may fear nothing, save only offending God. For then also was there a
furnace burning; yet they derided it, but feared sin. For they knew that if
they were consumed in the fire, they should suffer nothing that was to be
dreaded; but that if they were guilty of impiety: they should undergo the
extremes of misery. It is the greatest punishment to commit sin, though we
may remain unpunished; as on the other hand, it is the greatest honor and
repose to live virtuously, though we may be punished. For sins separate
us from God; as He Himself speaks; "Have not your sins separated
between you and Me?" But punishments lead us back to God. As one
saith, "Give peace; for Thou hast recompensed us for all things." Suppose
any one hath a wound; which is the most deserving of fear, gangrene, or
the surgeon's knife? the steel, or the devouring progress of the ulcer? Sin is
a gangrene, punishment is the surgeon's knife. As then, he who hath a
gangrene, although he is not lanced, hath to sustain the malady, and is then
in the worse condition, when he is not lanced; so also the sinner, though he

be not punished, is the most wretched of men; and is then especially
wretched, when he hath no punishment, and is suffering no distress. And
as those who have a disease of the spleen, or a dropsy, when they enjoy a
plentiful table, and cool drinks, and a variety of delicacies, and condiments,
are then especially in a most pitiable state, increasing as they do their
disease by luxury; but should they rigorously subject themselves to hunger
and thirst, according to medical laws, they might have some hope of
recovery; so also those who live in iniquity, if they are punished, may
have favorable hopes; but if, together with their wickedness, they enjoy
security and luxury, they become more wretched than those who cram
their bellies, though they are in a state of dropsy; and so much the more,
as the soul is better than the body. If then thou seest any who are in the
same sins, and some of them struggling continually with hunger, and a
thousand ills; while others are drinking their fill, and living sumptuously,
and gormandizing; think those the better off, who endure sufferings. For
not only is the flame of voluptuousness cut off by these misfortunes, but
they also depart to the future Judgment, and that dread tribunal, with no
small relief; and go hence, hawing discharged here the penalty of the greater
part of their sins by the ills they have suffered.

15. But enough of consolation. It is time for us now, at last, to proceed to
the exhortation on the subject of avoiding oaths, and to remove that
seeming palliation on behalf of those who swear, which is but futile, and
useless. For when we bring an accusation against them, they allege the case
of others who do the very same thing; and they say, "such and such
persons swear." Let us then say to these, Nevertheless; such a man does
not swear: and God will give His judgment concerning thee, from those
who do good works; for sinners do not profit sinners by fellowship in
transgressions; but they who perform what is right condemn sinners. For
they who gave not Christ food, or drink, were many; but they rendered no
aid to each other. Similar also was the case of the five virgins, who found
no pardon from companionship, but being condemned by a comparison
with those who had acted wisely, both these and the former were alike
punished.

16. Dismissing then this argument of frigid self-deception, let us not look
at the case of those who fall, but at those who fashion their conduct
rightly; and let us endeavor to carry along with us a memento of the

present fast when it is over. And as it often happens when we have
purchased a vestment, or a slave, or a precious vase, we recall again the
time when we did so, and say to each other, "That slave I purchased at
such a festival; that garment I bought at such a time;" so, in like manner, if
we now reduce to practice this law, we shall say, I reformed the practice
of swearing during that Lent; for till then I was a sweater; but from barely
hearing an admonition, I have abstained from the sin.

But "the custom," it may be objected, "is a hard thing to be reformed." I
know it is; and therefore am urgent to throw you into another custom,
which is good and profitable. For when you say, it is difficult for me to
abstain from what is habitual; for that very reason, I say, you should make
haste to abstain, knowing for certain, that if you oncemake another custom
for yourself of not swearing, you will want no labor afterwards. Which is
the more difficult thing; not to swear, or to remain the whole day without
food; and to shrivel up on water-drinking, and meager diet? It is evident
that the latter surpasses the former; yet, notwithstanding, custom has
made this matter so possible and easy of execution, that when the fast
comes round, although any one should exhort a thousand times, or as
frequently constrain and compel one to partake of wine, or taste of any
other of those things which are forbidden during fasts, yet a man would
prefer to suffer anything, rather than touch the prohibited article of food;
and that not for want of relish for the table, nevertheless, we bear it all
with fortitude, from the habit of our conscience. And the case will be the
same in regard to oaths; and just as if now, any one were to impose ever so
great necessity, you would remain immovable, holding fast the habit; so
also in that case, if any one should urge you ten thousand times, you
would not depart from your custom.

18. When you go home, therefore, discourse of all these things with those
who are in your house; and as many persons often do, when they come
back from a meadow, having plucked there a rose, or a violet, or some
flower of that kind, they return twisting it about with their fingers; and as
some, again, when they quit the gardens to go home, take with them
branches of trees, with their fruit upon them; and as others, moreover,
from sumptuous feasts, carry away leavings of the entertainment for their
dependents; so indeed do thou, departing from hence, take an exhortation
home to thy wife, thy children, and all thine household. For this

admonition is more profitable than the meadow, the garden, or the
banqueting table. These roses never wither; these fruits never drop off;
these dainties never corrupt. The former yield a temporary delight; but the
latter a lasting advantage, not only after this reformation has taken place,
but in the very act of reforming. For think what a good practice this would
be, having dismissed all other matters public or private, to discourse only
of the divine laws continually, at the tables in the forum, and in your other
meetings. Would we give our attention to these things, we should say
nothing of a dangerous or injurious nature, nor should we sin unwittingly.
Giving our leisure to discourse respecting these things, we should be able
to withdraw our soul even from this despondency that hangs over us,
instead of looking with so much anxiety as we do, whilst we say one to
another, "Hath the Emperor heard what hath happened? Is he incensed?
What sentence hath he pronounced? Hath any one petitioned him? What?
Will he himself endure to destroy utterly a city so great and populous?"
Casting these and all such cares upon God, let us be anxious only as to
what He hath commanded! Thus shall we rid ourselves of all these
sorrows; and although ten only among us should succeed, the ten would
quickly become twenty; the twenty fifty; the fifty a hundred; the hundred
a thousand; the thousand all the city, And just as when ten lamps are
lighted, one may easily fill the whole house with light, so also with respect
to right actions; should only ten act rightly, we shall light up a general
flame throughout the city, to shine forth, and to procure us safety. For not
so naturally does the fire, when it falls upon a forest, kindle the
neighboring trees successively, as will the emulation for virtue, when it
seizes upon a few minds, be mighty in its progress to diffuse itself through
the whole community.

19. Give me cause, then, to exult over you both in the present life, and at
that future Day, when those to whom talents have been entrusted, shall be
summoned! Your good reputation is a sufficient reward for my labors; and
if I see you living in piety, I have all I wish. Do, then, what yesterday I
recommended, and today will repeat, and will not cease to say it. Fix a
penalty for those who swear; a penalty which is a gain, and not a loss; and
prepare yourselves henceforth so as you may give us a proof of success.
For I shall endeavor to hold a long conversation with each of you, when
this assembly is dismissed; in order that in the continuance of discourse I

may discover the persons who have been acting rightly, and those who
have not. And if I find any one still swearing, I shall make him manifest to
all who are amended, that by reproving, rebuking, and correcting, we may
quickly deliver him from this evil habit. For better it is that he should
amend through being reproached here, than that he should be put to shame,
and punished, in the presence of the whole assembled universe, on that
Days when our sins shall be revealed to the eyes of all men! But God
forbid that any in this fair assembly should appear there suffering such
things! but by the prayers of the holy fathers? correcting all our offenses,
and having shown forth the abundant fruit of virtue, may we depart hence
with much confidence, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, through whom, and with whom, be glory to the Father
together with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 7

Recapitulation of former exhortations. Sin brought death and grief
into the world, and they tend to its cure. Grief serviceable only for
the destruction of sin. Remarks upon the passage, Genesis 1:1. "In
the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." It is argued
that God's forethought for man in the work of creation affords
grounds of comfort; and that mercy is shewn even in chastisement,
as in the saying, "Adam, where art thou?" Concluding admonition
on the avoidance of oaths.

1. YESTERDAY, I discoursed unto your Charity in many words, and upon
many subjects; and if out of this variety, it be not possible for you to
retain all, I wish more particularly to recall to memory the observation,
that God bath implanted the affection grief in our natures for no other
reason but because of sin, and He hath made this evident from actual
experience. For whilst we are grieved and distressed through the loss of
wealth; or by reason of sickness, and death, and the other evils that befall
us, we not only reap no consolation from our sorrow, but we also increase
the force of these calamities. But if we are in pain and sorrow for our sins,
we diminish the weight of sin; we make that little which is great; and very
often we blot it all out entirely. Ye should continually remember this, I
repeat, in order that ye may mourn for sin only, and for nothing besides;
and the additional fact, that sin, though it brought death and sadness into
our life, is again destroyed by both these; which I have recently made
evident. Therefore, let us fear nothing so much as sin and transgression.
Let us not fear punishment, and then we shall escape punishment. Even as
the Three Children were not afraid of the furnace, and so escaped from the
furnace. Such indeed it becomes the servants of God to be. For if those
who were brought up under the Old dispensation, when death was not yet
slain, nor his "brazen gates broken down," nor his "iron bars smitten in
sunder;" so nobly encountered their end, how destitute of all defense or
excuse shall we be, if, after having had the benefit of such great grace, we
attain not even to the same measure of virtue as they did, now when death
is only a name, devoid of reality. For death is nothing more than a sleep, a

journey, a migration, a rest, a tranquil haven; an escape from trouble, and a
freedom from the cares of this present life!

2. But here let us dismiss the subject of consolation; it is the fifth day we
are engaged in speaking words of comfort to your Charity, and we might
now seem to be troublesome. For what hath been already said is sufficient
for those who give heed; but to those who are pusillanimous it will be no
gain, even though we were to add to what we have said. It is now time to
direct our teaching to the exposition of the Scriptures. For as, if we had
said nothing in reference to the present calamity, one might have
condemned us for cruelty, and a want of humanity; so, were we always
discoursing of this, we might justly be condemned for pusillanimity.
Commending then your hearts to God, who is able to speak into your
minds, and to expel all grief from within, let us now take up our
accustomed manner of instruction; and that especially since every
exposition of Scripture is matter of comfort and relief. So that, although
we may seem to be desisting from the topic of consolation, we shall again
light upon the same subject by means of Scriptural exposition. For that all
Scripture furnishes consolation to those who give attention to it, I will
make manifest to you from its own evidence. For I shall not go about
among the Scripture narratives to search out certain arguments
consolatory; but in order that I may make the proof of the matter which I
have undertaken plainer, we will take in hand the book which has to day
been read to us; and bringing forward, if you will, the introduction and
commencement of it, which may especially seem to present no trace of
consolation, but to be altogether foreign to topics of comfort, I will make
that which I affirm evident.

3. What then is this introduction? "In the beginning God made the heaven
and the earth, and the earth was invisible, and unformed? and darkness was
upon the face of the abyss." Do these words seem to some of you
incapable of affording consolation under distress? Is it not an historical
narrative, and an instruction about the creation?

Would you then that I show the consolation that is hidden in this saying?
Arouse yourselves then, and attend with earnestness to the things which
are about to be spoken. For when thou hearest that God made the heaven,
the earth, the sea, the air, the waters, the multitude of stars, the two great

lights, the plants, the quadrupeds, the swimming and the flying animals,
and all things without exception which thou seest, for thee, and for thy
safety and honor; dost thou not straight-way take comfort and receive this
as the strongest proof of the love of God, when thou thinkest that He
produced such a world as this, so fair, so vast and wonderful, for such a
puny being as thyself! When therefore thou hearest that, "In the beginning
God made the heaven and the earth," run not hastily over the declaration;
but traverse in thy mind the breadth of the earth; and reflect how He hath
spread outs so sumptuous and exquisite a table for us, and provided us
with such abundant gladness. And this is, indeed, the most marvelous
thing, that He gave us not such a world as this in payment for services
done; or as a recompense for good works; but at the very time He formed
us, He honored our race with this kingdom. For He said, "Let us make man
after our image, and after our likeness." What is the sense of this, "after
our image, and after our likeness?" The image of government is that which
is meant; and as there is no one in heaven superior to God, so let there be
none upon earth superior to man. This then is one, and the first respect, in
which He did him honor; by making him after His own image; and
secondly, by providing us with this principality, not as a payment for
services, but making it entirely the gift of His own love toward man; and
thirdly, in that He conferred it upon us as a thing of nature. For of
governments there are some natural, and others which are elective; -
natural as of the lion over the quadrupeds, or as that of the eagle over the
birds; elective, as that of an Emperor over us; for he doth not reign over his
fellow-servants by any natural authority. Therefore it is that he oftentimes
loses his sovereignty. For such are things which are not naturally inherent;
they readily admit of change and transposition. But not so with the lion;
he rules by nature over the quadrupeds, as the eagle doth over birds. The
character of sovereignty is, therefore, constantly allotted to his race; and
no lion hath ever been seen deprived of it. Such a kind of sovereignty God
bestowed upon us from the beginning, and set us over all things. And not
only in this respect did He confer honor upon our nature, but also, by the
very eminence of the spot in which we were placed, fixing upon Paradise
as our choice dwelling, and bestowing the gift of reason, and an immortal
soul.

4. But I would not speak of these things: for I say that such was the
abundance of God's care, that we may know His goodness, and His love
towards man, not only from the way in which He hath honored, but also
from the way in which He hath punished us. And this, I especially exhort
you to consider with attention, that God is alike good, not only whilst He
is treating us with honor and beneficence, but also whilst He is punishing
and chastising. And whether we should have to carry on our contest and
combat against the heathen, or against the heretics, respecting the
lovingkindness and goodness of God, we shall make His goodness evident,
not only from the cases in which He bestows honor, but also from the
cases in which He inflicts punishment. For if He is good only whilst
honoring us, and not good whilst punishing us, He were but half good. But
this is not the case. God forbid! Among men this may probably happen,
when they inflict punishments in anger and passion; but God being free
from passion, whether He exercise kindness, or whether He punish, He is
alike good. Nor less does the threat of hell serve to show His goodness,
than the promise of the kingdom. But how? I answer. If He had not
threatened hell, if He had not prepared punishment, there are not many
who would have attained the kingdom. For the promise of good things
doth not so strongly induce the multitude to virtue; as cloth the threat of
evil things compel by fear, and arouse them to the care of the soul. So that,
although hell be the opposite of the kingdom of heaven, yet each hath
respect to the same end - the salvation of men; the one alluring to itself,
the other driving them towards its opposite, and by the operation of fear
correcting those who are carelessly disposed.

5. I do not enlarge upon this subject without reason; but because there are
many who often, when famines, and droughts, and wars take place, or
when the wrath of an Emperor overtakes them, or when any other
unexpected events of this kind happen, deceive the simpler class by
saying, that these things are unworthy of the Providence of God.

I am therefore compelled to dwell on this part of my discourse, that we
may not be beguiled by words, but that we may plainly perceive, that
whether He brings upon us a famine, or a war, or any calamity,
whatsoever, He doth it out of His exceeding great care and kindness. For
even those fathers, who especially love their offspring, will forbid them
the table, and inflict stripes, and punish them by disgrace, and in endless

other ways of this kind correct their children when they are disorderly; yet
are they nevertheless fathers, not only while doing them honor, but when
acting thus; yea, they are pre-eminently fathers when they act thus. But if
men, who are frequently carried away beyond what is meet by the force of
angry feelings, are yet held to punish those whom they love, not from
cruelty and inhumanity, but from a kind care and regard; much rather is it
proper to be thus minded concerning God; who in the exceeding abundance
of His goodness, far transcends every degree of paternal fondness. And
that you may not suppose that what I say is a mere conjecture, let us, I
pray you, direct our discourse to the Scripture itself. When man, then, had
been deceived and beguiled by the wicked demon, let us observe how God
treated him, after his committing so great a sin. Did He then altogether
destroy him? Yet the reason of the thing in justice demanded this, that one
who had displayed nothing that was good, but, after enjoying so much
favor, had waxed wanton even from the very first, should be made away
with, and utterly destroyed; yet God acted not so; neither did He regard
with disgust and aversion him who had been so ungrateful towards his
Benefactor, but He comes to him as a physician cometh to a sick man.

6. Do not, O beloved, pass over unthinkingly, what has just been said! but
consider what an act it was, not to send an angel, or archangel, or any other
of his fellow-servants, but that the Lord Himself should have descended to
him who had fallen from the right way, and should have raised him when
thus cast down; and should have approached him, One to one, as a friend
comes to a friend when he is unfortunate, and is plunged in great distress!
For that He acted thus out of His great kindness, the very words too
which He spake to him evidently show His ineffable affection. And why
do I say, all the words? The first utterance signifies at once His
tenderness. For He said not, what it was probable a person treated so
contemptuously would say, "O wicked, yea most wicked man! When
thou hadst enjoyed so great favor from Me, and hadst been honored with
such a sovereignty, being exalted above all the creatures upon the earth for
no merit of thine own; and having received in actual deeds the pledges of
My care, and a true manifestation of My Providence, didst thou esteem a
wicked and pestiferous demon, the enemy of thy salvation, to be worthy
of more credit than thy Lord and Benefactor? What proof did he give of
regard for thee, like that which I have done? Did I not make for thee the

heaven, the earth, the sea, the sun, the moon, and all the stars? For truly
none of the angels needed this work of creation; but for thee, and for thy
recreation, I made so great and excellent a world; and didst thou esteem
mere words alone, a false engagement, and a promise full of deceit, as more
worthy to be believed than the kindness and providence that was
manifested by deeds; that thou gavest thyself over to him, and didst
trample My laws under foot!" These words, and more of this kind, one
who had been treated contemptuously would probably say. But God
acted not so; but quite in the contrary manner. For by His first word He at
once raised him up from his dejection, and gave the fearful and trembling
man confidence, by being the first Himself to call him, or rather, not by
merely calling him first, but by addressing him by his own familiar
appellation, and saying, "Adam, where art thou?" Thus He shewed His
tenderness, and the great regard He had for him. For ye must all know, that
this is a mark of intimate friendship. And thus those who call upon the
dead are wont to do, continually repeating their names. And so, on the
other hand, those who entertain hatred and enmity against any, cannot
bear to mention the very names of those who have aggrieved them. Saul,
for instance, though he had sustained no injury from David, but had
wronged him exceedingly, since he abhorred and hated him, could not
endure to mention his proper name; but when all were seated together, not
seeing David to be present, what said he? He said not, "Where is David?
but, ‘Where is the son of Jesse?'" calling him by his father's name. And
again, the Jews did the same with respect to Christ, for since they
abhorred and hated Him, they did not say, "Where is Christ?" but, "Where
is that man?"

7. But God, willing to show even by this that sin had not quenched His
tenderness, nor disobedience taken away His favor toward him, and that
He still exercised His Providence and care for the fallen one, said, "Adam,
where art thou?" not being ignorant of the place where he was, but because
the mouth of those who have sinned is closed up; sin turning the tongue
backward, and conscience taking hold of it; so that such persons remain
speechless, held fast in silence as by a kind of chain. And God wishing
therefore to invite him to freedom of utterance, and to give him confidence,
and to lead him to make an apology for his offenses, in order that he might
obtain some forgiveness, was Himself the first to call; cutting off much of

Adam's distress by the familiar appellation, and dispelling his fear, and
opening by this address the mouth that was shut. Hence also it was that
he said, "Adam, where art thou?" "I left thee," saith he, "in one situation,
and I find thee in another. I left thee in confidence and glory; and I now
find thee in disgrace and silence!" And observe the care of God in this
instance. He called not Eve; - He called not the serpent, - but him who
had sinned in the lightest degree of all, he brings first to the tribunal, in
order that beginning from him who was able to find some degree of excuse,
He might pass a more merciful sentence, even against her who had sinned
the most. And judges, indeed, do not deign to make inquiry in their own
person of their fellow-servants, and those who are partakers of a common
nature with them, but putting forward some one of their attendants to
intervene, they instruct him to convey their own questions to the criminal;
and through him they say and hear whatever they wish, when they
examine the offenders. But God had no need of a go-between in dealing
with man; but Himself in His own person at once judges and consoles him.
And not only this is wonderful, but also that he corrects the crimes that
had been committed. For judges in general, when they find thieves and
grave-robbers, do not consider how they may make them better, but how
they may make them pay the penalty of the offenses committed. But
God, quite on the contrary, when He finds a sinner, considers not how He
may make him pay the penalty, but how He may amend him, and make
him better, and invincible for the future. So that God is at the same time a
Judge, a Physician, and a Teacher; for as a Judge He examines, and as a
Physician He amends, and as a Teacher He instructs those who have
sinned, directing them unto all spiritual wisdom.

8. But if one short and simple speech thus demonstrates the care of God,
what if we should read through this whole judgment, and unfold its entire
records? Seest thou how all Scripture is consolation and comfort? But of
these records we will speak at a befitting season; before that, however, it is
necessary to state at what time this Book was given; for these things were
not written in the beginning, nor at once when Adam was made, but many
generations afterwards; and it were worth while to enquire for what reason
this delay took place, and why at length they were given to the Jews only,
and not to all men; and why written in the Hebrew tongue; and why in the
wilderness of Sinai? For the Apostle doth not mention the place merely in

a cursory manner; but shews that in that circumstance too there was a
great subject of contemplation for us, when he saith to us: "For these are
two covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage."

9. Other things too besides these it were to our purpose to enquire into.
But I see that the time doth not permit us to launch our discourse upon so
wide a sea; wherefore prudently reserving these to a fit season, we would
again address you on the subject of abstinence from oaths; and we would
entreat your Charity to use much diligence respecting this matter. For
what is it but an absurdity, that not even a servant dares to call his master
by name, nor to mention him unceremoniously, and casually, but that he
should everywhere bandy about the name of the Lord of Angels familiarly
with much irreverence! And if it be necessary to take the book of the
Gospel, thou receivest it with hands that have been first washed; and
fearfully and tremblingly, with much reverence and devotion; and dost
thou unceremoniously bandy about upon thy tongue the Lord of the
Gospel? Dost thou desire to learn how the Powers above pronounce that
Name; with what awe, with what terror, with what wonder? "I saw the
Lord," saith the prophet, "sitting upon a throne, high, and lifted up;
around Him stood the Seraphim; and ones cried unto another, and said,
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabbath; the whole earth is full of His
glory!" Perceivest thou, with what dread, with what awe, they pronounce
that Name, whilst glorifying and praising Him? But thou, in thy prayers
and supplications, callest upon Him with much listlessness; when it would
become thee to be full of awe, and to be watchful and sober! But in oaths,
where it is wholly unsuitable that this wonderful Name should be
introduced, there thou makest a long string of divers forms of imprecation!
What pardon then, or what excuse shall we have, howsoever we may plead
this "custom"? It is said, that a certain heathen orator, by a kind of foolish
habit, was continually moving his right shoulder as he went along. He
conquered this habit, however, by fastening sharp knives on each side over
his shoulders, so that the fear of being cut controlled the member in its
unseasonable movement by fear of the wound! Do thou too, then, act thus
with regard to thy tongue, and instead of the knife, suspend over it the fear
of God's chastisement, and thou wilt assuredly get the better! For it seems
impossible, utterly impossible, that those should ever be overcome, who
are solicitous and earnest about this, and really make it their business.

10. Ye applaud what is now said, but when ye have amended, ye will
applaud in a greater degree not only us, but also yourselves; and ye will
hear with more pleasure what is spoken; and ye will call upon God with a
pure conscience, who is so sparing of thee, O man! that He saith, "Neither
shall thou swear by thy head." But thou so despisest Him as to swear
even by His glory. "But what shall I do," saith one, "with those who
impose necessity on me?" What kind of necessity can there be, O man?
Let all men understand that thou wilt choose to suffer anything rather than
transgress the law of God; and they will abstain from compelling thee. For
as a proof that it is not an oath which rendereth a man worthy of credit,
but the testimony of his life, the uprightness of his conversation, and his
good reputation, many have often split their throats with swearing, and
yet have been able to convince no one; whereas others by a mere
expression of assent, have been esteemed more deserving of belief than
they who swore never so much. Knowing, therefore, all these things, and
placing before our eyes the punishment that is in store for those who
swear, as well as for those who swear falsely, let us abstain from this evil
custom, that advancing from hence to the correction of what remains, we
may enjoy the blessedness of the life to come, which God grant that we
may all be found worthy to obtain, by the grace and love toward man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom and with Whom to the Father with
the Holy Ghost be glory, and power, and honor, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.

HOMILY 8

An exhortation to virtue - and particularly upon the passage,
"God was walking in Paradise in the cool of the day:" - and
again on the subject of abstaining from oaths.

YE have lately heard, how all Scripture bringeth consolation and comfort,
although it be an historical narrative. For instance, "In the beginning, God
created the heaven and the earth," was an historical declaration; but it was
shewn in our discourse, that this sentence was one pregnant with comfort;
as, for example, that God made us a twofold table, by spreading out the
sea and the land at the same time; by kindling above the twofold lights, the
sun and moon; by determining the twofold seasons of their course, the day
and night, the one for labor, and the other for rest. For the night ministers
to us no less benefit than the day. But as I said with reference to trees,
those which are barren, rival in their utility those which bear fruit; since
we are thus not necessitated to touch those trees which are pleasant for
food, for the purposes of building. The wild and untamed animals are also
subservient to our need, in no less a degree than the tame animals; by
driving us together, through the fear of them, into cities; making us more
cautious, and binding us to one another; and by exercising the strength of
some, and freeing others from their sicknesses; for the physicians concoct
many medicines out of these; and by reminding us of our ancient sin. For
when I hear it said, "The fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon
all the wild beasts of the earth:" and then observe, that this honor was
afterwards curtailed, I am reminded of sin, which hath dissipated the fear
of us, and undermined our authority. Thus I become a better and a wiser
man, whilst I learn the harm that sin hath occasioned us. As then, what I
said was, that the things alluded to, and others of a similar kind, which
God, who is the Maker, knoweth of, contribute not a little to our present
life; so now also I say, that the night no less than the day brings along with
it its advantage, being a rest from labors, and a medicine for disease. Often,
indeed, physicians, though exerting themselves in many ways, and
preparing an endless variety of remedies, are not able to deliver the man
who is laboring under infirmity. But sleep coming upon him of its own
accord hath entirely removed the disease, and freed them from an infinite

deal of trouble. Night, again, is not only a medicine for bodily labors, but
also for mental diseases, in giving rest to anguished souls. Ofttimes it
happeneth that some one hath lost a son; and comforters without number
have been of no avail to withdraw him from tears and groans. But on the
approach of night, conquered by the despotic powers of sleep, he hath
closed his eyelids in slumber, and received some small relief from the
miseries of the day time.

2. And now, I pray you, let us proceed to the subject which hath given
rise to these observations. For well I know, that ye are all eagerly awaiting
this matter; and that each one of you is in pain till he learn on what
account this Book was not given from the beginning. But even now I do
not see that the time is fit for a discourse on this subject. And why so?
Because the week hath nearly arrived at its close with us, and I fear to
touch upon a subject, the exposition of which I should presently
afterwards be obliged to cut short. For the subject requires of us several
days in succession, and a continuous effort of memory: wherefore we
must again defer it. But take it not amiss! we will assuredly pay you the
debt with interest; for thus it is expedient both for you, and for us who are
to discharge it. Meanwhile, however, let us now speak on that subject
which we left out yesterday. And what was it we left out yesterday?
"God was walking," it says, "in Paradise in the cool of the day." What is
here meant, I ask? "God was walking!" God was not walking; for how
should He do this who is everywhere present and filleth all things? But He
caused a perception of this sort in Adam, in order that he might collect
himself; that he might not be careless; that in flying and in hiding himself,
he might present beforehand some portion of the excuse, even before any
words had passed. For even as those who are about to be led to the
tribunal, to sustain the charges respecting the crimes they have committed
present themselves before those who are to try them with a squalid,
begrimed, sad, and subdued visage, in order that from their appearance,
they may incline them to loving-kindness, mercy, and forgiveness, so also
did it happen in the case of Adam. For it was necessary that he should be
led to this Tribunal in a subdued state. Therefore God took him
beforehand, and humbled him. But that some one was walking there, he
perceived; but whence came he to suppose that God was walking there?
Such is the habitual custom of those who have committed sin. They are

suspicious of all things; they tremble at shadows; they are in terror at
every sound, and they imagine that every one is approaching them in a
hostile manner. Often therefore the guilty, when they observe people
running on another business, suppose that they are come against them; and
when others are conversing one with another on quite a different subject,
they that are conscious of sin suppose they are conversing about them.

3. For such is the nature of sin, that it betrays whilst no one finds fault; it
condemns whilst no one accuses; it makes the sinner a timid being; one
that trembles at a sound; even as righteousness has the contrary effect.
Hear, at least, how the Scripture describes this cowardice of the former,
and this boldness of the latter. "The wicked flee when no man pursueth."
How doth he flee when no man pursueth? He hath that within which
drives him on - an accuser in his conscience; and this he carries about
everywhere; and just as it would be impossible to flee from himself, so
neither can he escape the persecutor within; but wherever he goeth, he is
scourged, and hath an incurable wound! But not such is the righteous man.
Of what nature then is he? Hear: "The righteous is bold as a lion!" Such a
man was Elias. He saw, for instance, the king coming towards him, and
when he said, "Why is it that thou pervertest Israel?" he answered, "I
pervert not Israel, but thou and thy father's house." Truly, the just man is
bold as a lion; for he stood up against the king just as a lion doth against
some vile cur. Although the one had the purple, the other had the
sheepskin, which was the more venerable garment of the two; for that
purple brought forth the grievous famine; but this sheepskin effected a
liberation from that calamity! It divided the Jordan! It made Elisha a
twofold Elias! O how great is the virtue of the Saints! Not only their
words; not only their bodies, but even their very garments are always
esteemed venerable by the whole creation. The sheepskin of this man
divided the Jordan! the sandals of the Three Children trampled down the
fire! The word of Elisha changed the waters, so that it made them to bear
the iron on their surface! The rod of Moses divided the Red Sea and cleft
the rock! The garments of Paul expelled diseases! The shadow of Peter put
death to flight! The ashes of the holy Martyrs drive away demons! For
this reason they do all things with authority, even as Elias did. For he
looked not on the diadem, nor the outward pomp of the king, but he
looked on the soul clad in rags, squalid, begrimed, and in a more wretched

condition than that of any criminal; and seeing him the captive and slave of
his passions, he despised his power. For he seemed to see a king but in a
scene, and not a real one. For what was the advantage of outward
abundance, when the poverty within was so great? And what harm could
outward poverty do, when there was such a treasure of wealth within?
Such a lion also was the blessed Paul; for when he had entered into the
prison, and only raised his voice, he shook all the foundations; he gnawed
in pieces the fetters, employing not his teeth, but words; on which account
it were fitting to call such men not merely lions, but something more than
lions; for a lion oft-times, after he hath fallen into a net, is taken; but the
Saints when they are bound, become still more powerful; just as this
blessed man did then in the prison, having loosed the prisoners, shaken the
walls, and bound the keeper, and overcome him by the word of godliness.
The lion uttereth his voice, and putteth all the wild beasts to flight. The
Saint uttereth his voice, and driveth away the demons on every side! The
weapons of the lion are a hairy mane, pointed claws, and sharp teeth. The
weapons of the righteous man are spiritual wisdom, temperance, patience,
contempt of all present things. Whoever hath these weapons shall not
only be able to deride wicked men, but even the adverse powers
themselves.

4. Study then, O man, the life according to God, and no one shall conquer
thee at any time; and although thou mayest be accounted the most
insignificant of men, thou shall be more powerful than all. On the other
hand, if thou art indifferent about virtue of soul, though thou wert the
most powerful of men, thou wilt easily be worsted by all that assail thee.
And the examples already quoted proved this. But if thou art desirous, I
will also endeavor to teach thee by actual facts the unconquerableness of
the righteous, and the vulnerable condition of sinners. Hear then how the
prophet intimates both these particulars. "The ungodly," saith he, "are not
so, but are like the chaff which the wind scattereth away from the face of
the earth." For even as chaff lies exposed to the gusts of wind, and is
easily caught up and swept along, so is also the sinner driven about by
every temptation; for whilst he is at war with himself, and bears the
warfare about with him, what hope of safety does he possess; betrayed as
he is at home, and carrying with him that conscience, which is a constant
enemy? Such, however, is not the nature of the righteous man. But what

manner of man is he? Hear the same prophet, saying, "They that trust in
the Lord are as Mount Zion." What means then, "As Mount Zion?" "He
shall not be shaken," saith he, "for ever." For whatever engines thou
bringest up, whatever darts thou hurlest, desiring to overturn a mountain,
thou wilt never be able to prevail; for how canst thou? thou wilt break in
pieces all thine engines, and exhaust thine own strength. Such also is the
righteous man. Whatever blows he may receive, he suffereth no evil
therefrom; but destroyeth the power of those who take counsel against
him, and not of men only, but of demons. Thou hast heard often what
engines the Devil brought up against Job; but not only did he fail to
overthrow that mountain, but drew back exhausted, his darts broken to
pieces, and his engines rendered useless, by that assault!

5. Knowing these things, let us take heed to our life; and let us not be
earnest as to the goods that perish; neither as to the glory that goeth out;
nor as to that body which groweth old; nor as to that beauty which is
fading; nor as to that pleasure which is fleeting; but let us expend all our
care about the soul; and let us provide for the welfare of this in every way.
For to cure the body, when diseased, is not an easy matter to every one;
but to cure a sick soul is easy to all; and the sickness of the body requires
medicines, as well as money, for its healing; but the healing of the soul is a
thing that is easy to procure, and devoid of expense. And the nature of the
flesh is with much labor delivered from those wounds which are
troublesome; for very often the knife must be applied, and medicines that
are bitter; but with respect to the soul there is nothing of this kind. It
suffices only to exercise the will, and the desire, and all things are
accomplished. And this hath been the work of God's providence. For
inasmuch as from bodily sickness no great injury could arise, (for though
we were not diseased, yet death would in any case come, and destroy and
dissolve the body); but everything depends upon the health of our souls;
this being by far the more precious and necessary, He hath made the
medicining of it easy, and void of expense or pain. What excuse therefore,
or what pardon shall we obtain, if when the body is sick, and money must
be expended on its behalf, and physicians called in, and much anguish
endured, we make this so much a matter of our care (though what might
result from that sickness could be no great injury to us), and yet treat the
soul with neglect? And this, when we are neither called upon to pay down

money; nor to give others any trouble; nor to sustain any sufferings; but
without any of all these things, by only choosing and willing, have it in our
power to accomplish the entire amendment of it; and knowing assuredly
that if we fail to do this, we shall sustain the extreme sentence, and
punishments, and penalties, which are inexorable! For tell me, if any one
promised to teach thee the healing art in a short space of time, without
money or labor, wouldest thou not think him a benefactor? Wouldest thou
not submit both to do and to suffer all things, whatsoever he who
promised these things commanded? Behold, now, it is permitted thee
without labor to find a medicine for wounds, not of the body, but of the
soul and to restore it to a state of health, without any suffering! Let us not
be indifferent to the matter. For pray what is the pain of laying aside anger
against one who hath aggrieved thee? It is a pain, indeed, to remember
injuries, and not to be reconciled! What labor is it to pray, and to ask for a
thousand good things from God, who is ready to give? What labor is it, not
to speak evil of any one? What difficulty is there in being delivered from
envy and ill-will? What trouble is it to love one's neighbor? What suffering
is it not to utter shameful words, nor to revile, nor to insult another? What
fatigue is it not to swear? for again I return to this same admonition. The
labor of swearing is indeed exceedingly great. Oftentimes, whilst under the
influence of anger or wrath, we have sworn, perhaps, that we would never
be reconciled to those who have injured us. Yet afterwards, when our
wrath was quenched, and our anger allayed, desiring to be reconciled, and
restrained by the obligation of these oaths, we have suffered the same
anguish, as if we were in a snare, and held fast by indissoluble bonds. Of
which fact the Devil being aware, and understanding clearly that anger is a
fire; that it is easily extinguished, and that when it is extinguished, then
reconciliation and love follows; wishing this fire to remain unquenched, he
often binds us by an oath; so that although the anger should cease, the
obligation of the oath remaining may keep up the fire within us; and that
one of these two things may take place, either that being reconciled we are
forsworn, or that not being reconciled we subject ourselves to the penalties
of cherishing malice.

6. Knowing these things then, let us avoid oaths; and let our mouth
continually practice the saying, "Believe me;" and this will be to us a
foundation for all pious behavior; for the tongue, when it has been

disciplined to use this one expression, is ashamed, and would blush to
utter words that are disgraceful and ugly; and should it at any time be
drawn away by habit, it will be checked again, by having many accusers.
For when any one observes him who is not a swearer giving utterance to
foul words, he will take his advantage over him, and ridicule, and exclaim
tauntingly, "Thou who sayest in all affairs, ‘Believe me,' and venturest
not to utter an oath, dost thou disgrace thy tongue with these shameful
expressions?" So that being forcibly urged by those who are with us, even
if unwilling, we shall return again to a pious behavior. "But what," says
one, "if it be necessary to take an oath?" Where there is a transgression of
the law, there is no such thing as necessity. "Is it possible then," it is
replied, "not to swear at all?" What sayest thou? Hath God commanded,
and darest thou to ask if it be possible for His law to be kept? Why, truly
it is a thing impossible that His law should not be kept; and I am desirous
to persuade you from present circumstances of this; that so far from its
being impossible not to swear, it is impossible to swear? For behold, the
inhabitants of the city were commanded to bring in a payment of gold,
such as it might have seemed beyond the power of many to do; yet the
greater part of the sum has been collected; and you may hear the tax
gatherers saying, "Why delay, man? Why put us off from day to day? It is
not possible to avoid it. It is the law of the Emperor, which admits of no
delay." What sayest thou, I ask? The Emperor hath commanded thee to
bring in thy money, and it is impossible not to bring it in! God hath
commanded thee to avoid oaths! and how sayest thou, it is impossible to
avoid them!

7. I am now for the sixth day admonishing you in respect of this precept.
Henceforth, I am desirous to take leave of you, meaning to abstain from
the subject, that ye may be on your guard. There will no longer be any
excuse or allowance for you; for of right, indeed, if nothing had been said
on this matter, it ought to have been amended of yourselves, for it is not a
thing of an intricate nature, or that requires great preparation, But since ye
have enjoyed the advantage of so much admonition and counsel, what
excuse will ye have to offer, when ye stand accused before that dread
tribunal, and are required to give account of this transgression. It is
impossible to invent any excuse; but of necessity you must either go hence
amended, or, if you have not amended, be punished, and abide the

extremest penalty! Thinking, therefore, upon all these things, and
departing hence with much anxiety about them, exhort ye one another, that
the things spoken of during so many days may be kept with all
watchfulness in your minds, so that whilst we are silent, ye instructing,
edifying, exhorting one another, may exhibit great improvement; and
having fulfilled all the other precepts, may enjoy eternal crowns; which
God grant we may all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom be glory, to the Father,
together with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 9

Commendation of those who had laid aside the practice of
swearing. It is shown that no one need scruple about hearing the
divine oracles in the Church after a meal. Answer to the question,
Why it was so long before the Holy Scriptures were given?
Comment on the passage, "The heavens declare the glory of God,"
with a description of the natural world. And finally, an admonition
against swearing.

1. IT was but lately that I spoke to you as I do now to you again! And O
that I could be always with you, - yea, rather am I always with you,
though not by bodily presence, yet by the power of love! For I have no
other life but you, and the care of your salvation. As the husbandman hath
no other anxiety, but about his seeds and his harvests; and the pilot about
the waves and the harbors; so the preacher is anxious with respect to his
auditors and their progress, even as I am at the present time! Wherefore I
bear you all upon my mind, not only here, but also at home. For if the
multitude be great, and the measure of my heart be narrow, yet love is
wide; and "ye are not straitened in us." I will not add what follows next,
for neither are we straitened with you. Whence is this apparent? Because I
have met with many who have said, "We have performed the precept, by
making rules for each other, defining penalties for those who swear, and
enforcing punishment upon those who transgress this law." A punishment
which is indeed well becoming you, and which is a sign of the greatest
charity. For I am not ashamed of making myself busy in these matters,
since this love of interference does not proceed from idle curiosity but
from tender care. For if it be no reproach to the physician to make enquiry
concerning the patient, neither is it any fault in us to be ever asking about
your salvation; since thus being informed what has been accomplished, and
what has been left undone, we shall be able to apply the further remedies
with the requisite knowledge. These things we have ascertained by
enquiry; and we give thanks to God that we have not sown our seed upon
rocks, nor dropped it amidst thorns; and that we have neither needed much
time, nor long delay, in order that we might reap the harvest. On this
account I have you continually upon my heart. On this account I do not

feel the labors of teaching, being eased of the burden by the profit of the
hearer. This reward is, indeed, sufficient to recruit our strength, to give us
wings, to elevate us, and to persuade us to undergo the utmost toil on your
behalf.

2. Since therefore ye have manifested much generosity of feeling, suffer us
to discharge the further debt of which we gave a promise the other day;
although indeed I see not all present who were here when I made the
promise. What, I would ask, can be the cause of this? What hath repelled
them from our table? He that hath partaken of a bodily meal, it would
seem, has thought it an indignity after receiving material food, to come to
the hearing of the divine oracles. But not rightly do they think thus. For if
this were improper, Christ would not have gone through His large and long
discourses after that mystic supper; and if this had been unsuitable, He
would not, when He had fed the multitude in the desert, have
communicated His discourses to them after that meal. For (if one must say
something startling on this point), the hearing of the divine oracles at that
time is especially profitable. For when thou hast made up thy mind that
after eating and drinking thou must repair also to the assembly, thou wilt
assuredly be careful, though perchance with reluctance, of the duty of
sobriety; and wilt neither be led away at any time into excess of wine, or
gluttony. For the thought, and the expectation of entering the church,
schools thee to partake of food and drink with becoming decency; lest,
after thou hast entered there, and joined thy brethren, thou shouldest
appear ridiculous to all present, by smelling of wine, and unmannerly
eructation. These things I now speak not to you who are now present, but
to the absent; that they may learn them through your means. For it is not
having eaten that hinders one's hearing, but listlessness. But thou whilst
deeming it to be a condemnation not to fast, then addest another fault,
which is far greater and heavier, in not being a partaker of this sacred food;
and having nourished the body, thou consumest the soul with famine. Yet
what kind of apology hast thou for doing this? For in the matter of fasting
thou hast, perhaps, bodily weakness to plead, but what hast thou to say
with respect to hearing? For surely weakness of body is no impediment to
thy partaking of the divine oracles! If I had said, "Let no one who has
breakfasted mix with us;" "let no one who has eaten be a hearer," thou
wouldest have had some kind of excuse; but now, when we would fain

drag, entice, and beseech you to come, what apology can ye have for
turning away from us? The unfit hearer is not he that hath eaten and
drunk; but he who gives no heed to what is said, who yawns, and is slack
in attention, having his body here, but his mind wandering elsewhere, and
such a one, though he may be fasting, is an unprofitable hearer. On the
other hand, the man who is in earnest, who is watchful and keeps his mind
in a state of attention, though he may have eaten and drunk, will be our
most suitable hearer of all. For this rule, indeed, very properly prevails
with relation to the secular tribunals and councils. Inasmuch as they know
not how to be spiritually wise, therefore they eat not to nourishment, but
to bursting; and they drink often to excess. For Ibis reason, as they render
themselves unfit for the management of their affairs, they shut up the
court-houses and council-chambers in the evening and at midday. But here
there is nothing of this sort, - God forbid! But he who has eaten will rival
him who fasts, as far as regards sobriety of soul; for he eats and drinks,
not so as to distend the stomach, or to darken the reason, but in such a
way as to recruit the strength of the body when it has become weakened.

3. But enough of this admonition. It is time now to deal with our subject;
although our mind holds back and shrinks from giving this instruction, on
account of those who are not come. And just as an affectionate mother
when she is about to spread out her table, grieves and laments when all her
children are not there, thus also do I now suffer; and when I think of the
absence of our brethren, I am reluctant to discharge my debt. But ye have
it in your power to rid me of this tardiness. For if ye promise me that ye
will convey to them an exact report of all I say, we shall readily pay you
down the whole; for thus the instructions, charitably afforded on your
part, will make up to them for their absence; and ye will hear me the more
attentively, knowing that you must necessarily give an account of these
things to others. In order then that our subject may be made the clearer, let
us take it up and repeat it from the beginning. We were enquiring, then, the
other day, "On what account the Scriptures were delivered after so many
years. For this Book was delivered neither in the time of Adam, nor of
Noah, nor of Abraham, but in that of Moses. And I hear many who say,
that if the Book was profitable, it ought to have been delivered from the
very beginning; but if it was useless, it ought not to have been delivered
afterwards. But this is an obsolete argument; for it is not quite true that

anything which is profitable ought to have been delivered from the
beginning, nor if anything was delivered from the beginning, is it quite
necessary that the same should continue afterwards. For example; Milk is
useful, yet it is not always given; but it is given to us only when we are
children; and solid food is useful; but no one ever gives it us in the
beginning of our life, but when we have passed out of the age of childhood.
Again, the summer season is useful; but it does not show itself constantly;
and the winter season is advantageous; yet this too makes room for others.
What then? Do they say that the Scriptures are not useful? I reply; they
are most useful and most necessary. And if so useful, for what reason
then, say they, were they not delivered to us from the beginning? It was
because God was desirous of instructing the nature of man, not by letters,
but by things. But what does the expression "by things" signify? By
means of the Creation itself.

4. Observe then, how the Apostle, alighting upon this same topic, and
directing himself to those very Greeks who said, that they had not from
the beginning learnt the knowledge of God from the Scriptures, frames his
answer. Having said that, "the wrath of God is revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness;" when he saw that he was met by an objection; and that
many would still enquire, from whence the Gentiles knew the truth of
God, he goes on to add, "Because that which may be known of God is
manifest in them." But how is it manifest in them? How were they able to
know God, and who hath shewed? Declare this. "God," saith he, "hath
shewed it unto them." In what manner? By the sending of what kind of
prophet? what evangelist? what kind of teacher? if the holy Scriptures
were not yet given. "The invisible things of Him," says he, "from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that
are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead." But what he means is
just this, He hath placed His Creation in the midst, before the eyes of all
men; in order that they may guess at the Creator from His works; which,
indeed, another writer has referred to; "For from the greatness and beauty
of the creatures, proportionably the Maker of them is seen." Seest thou
the greatness? Marvel at the power of Him that made it! Seest thou the
beauty? be astonished at the wisdom which adorned it! This it was which
the prophet signified when he said, "The heavens declare the glory of

God." How then, tell me, do they declare it? Voice they have none; mouth
they possess not; no tongue is theirs! how then do they declare? By
means of the spectacle itself. For when thou seest the beauty, the breadth,
the height, the position, the form, the stability thereof during so long a
period; hearing as it were a voice, and being instructed by the spectacle,
thou adorest Him who created a body so fair and strange! The heavens
may be silent, but the sight of them emits a voice, that is louder than a
trumpet's sound; instructing us not by the ear, but through the medium of
the eyes; for the latter is a sense which is more sure and more distinct than
the former.

5. For if God had given instruction by means of books, and of letters, he
who knew letters would have learnt what was written; but the illiterate
man would have gone away without receiving any benefit from this source,
unless some one else had introduced him to it; and the wealthy man would
have purchased the Bible, but the poor man would not have been able to
obtain it. Again, he who knew the language that was expressed by the
letters, might have known what was therein contained; but the Scythian,
and the Barbarian, and the Indian, and the Egyptian, and all those who
were excluded from that language, would have gone away without receiving
any instruction. This however cannot be said with respect to the heavens;
but the Scythian, and Barbarian, and Indian, and Egyptian, and every man
that walks upon the earth, shall hear this voice; for not by means of the
ears, but through the sight, it reaches our understanding. And of the things
that are seen, there is one uniform perception; and there is no difference, as
is the case with respect to languages. Upon this volume the unlearned, as
well as the wise man, shall be alike able to look; the poor man as well as
the rich man; and wherever any one may chance to come, there looking
upwards towards the heavens, he will receive a sufficient lesson from the
view of them: and the prophet himself intimated and indicated this fact,
that the creation utters this voice so as to be intelligible to barbarians, and
to Greeks, and to all mankind without exception, when he spoke on this
wise; "There is no speech, nor language, where there voice is not heard."
What he means is to this effect, that there is no nation or tongue which is
unable to understand this language; but that such is their utterance, that it
may be heard of all mankind. And that not merely of the heavens, but of
the day and night. But how of the day and night? The heavens, indeed, by

their beauty and magnitude, and by all the rest, astonish the beholder, and
transport him to an admiration of the Creator; but as to the day and night,
what can these show us of the same kind? Nothing certainly of the same
kind, but other things which are not inferior to them; as for example; the
harmony, and the order which they so accurately observe. For when thou
considerest how they distribute between them the whole year, and
mutually divide the length of the whole space, even as if it were by a beam
and scales, thou wilt be astonished at Him who hath ordered them! For
just as certain sisters dividing their father's inheritance among themselves
with much affection, and not insulting one another in the smallest degree,
even so too the day and the night distribute the year with such an equality
of parts, with the utmost accuracy; and keep to their own boundaries, and
never push one, another aside. Never hath the day been long in winter; and
in like manner never hath the night been long in summer, whilst so many
generations have passed away; but during so great an interval and length of
time one hath not defrauded the other even in the smallest degree; not of
half an hour's space, no, nor of the twinkling of an eye!

6. Therefore also the Psalmist, struck with astonishment at the equality of
this distribution, exclaimed. "Night unto night sheweth knowledge." If
thou knowest how to meditate wisely on these matters, thou wilt admire
the Being who fixed these immovable boundaries even from the beginning.
Let the avaricious hear these things; and those who are coveting the wealth
of others; and let them imitate the equality of the day and night. Let those
who are puffed up and high-minded also hear; and those who are unwilling
to concede the first places to others! The day gives place to the night, and
does not invade the territory of others! But thou, whilst always enjoying
honor, canst thou not bear to share it with thy brethren? Consider also
with me the wisdom of the Lawgiver. In winter He hath ordered that the
night should be long; when the germs are tender, and require more
coolness; and are unable to sustain the hotter rays of the sun; but when
they are somewhat grown, the day again increases with them, and becomes
then the longest, when the fruit has now attained ripeness. And this is a
beneficial arrangement not only for seeds, but for our bodies. For since
during winter, the sailor, and the pilot, and the traveler, and the soldier,
and the farmer, sit down for the most part at home, fettered by the frost;
and the season is one of idleness; God hath appointed that the greater part

of this time should be consumed in night, in order that the length of the
day might not be superfluous, when men were unable to do anything. Who
can describe the perfect order of the seasons; and how these, like some
virgins dancing in a circle, succeed one another with the happiest harmony;
and how those who are in the middle cease not to pass over to the
opposite ones with a gradual and noiseless transition? Therefore, neither
are we overtaken by the summer immediately after winter; nor by the
winter immediately after the summer; but mid-way the spring is
interposed; that while we gently and gradually take up one season after the
other, we may have our bodies hardened to encounter the summer heat
without uneasiness. For since sudden changes to opposite extremes are
productive of the worst injury and disease, God hath contrived that after
winter we should take up the spring, and after the spring the summer; and
after the summer the autumn; and thus transport us to winter, so that
these changes from seasons which are opposite, should come upon us
harmlessly and by degrees, through the aid of intermediate ones. Who then
is so wretched and pitiable, that beholding the heavens; and beholding sea,
and land; and beholding this exact adjustment of the seasons, and the
unfailing order of day and night, he can think that these things happen of
their own accord, instead of adoring Him who hath arranged them all with
a corresponding wisdom!

7. But I have yet somewhat more to say on this head. For not only,
indeed, does the magnitude and beauty of the creation, but also the very
manner of it, display a God who is the artificer of the universe. For since
we were not present at the beginning, whilst he was engaged in the work of
forming and creating all things; nor had we been present, could we have
known how they came into being, the power that disposed them being
invisible; He hath made the mode of this creation to become our best
teacher, by compounding all things in a manner which transcends the
course of nature. Perhaps what I have said, is not sufficiently clear.
Therefore it is necessary that I should again repeat it in a clearer manner.
All men, then, must admit that it is the coarse of nature for water to be
supported on the earth, and not the earth on the waters. For the earth
being a certain dense, hard, unyielding, and solid substance, is easily able
to support the nature of water; but the water, which is fluid, and rare, and
soft, and diffusive, and giving way to all it meets with, must be unable to

support any solid body, though it were of the lightest kind. Often indeed
when a small pebble fails upon it, it yields, and makes way, and sends it
down to the bottom. When therefore thou beholdest not a small pebble,
but the whole earth born upon the waters, and not submerged, admire the
power of Him who wrought these marvelous things in a supernatural
manner! And whence does this appear, that the earth is born upon the
waters? The prophet declares this when he says, "He hath rounded it
upon the seas, and prepared it upon the floods." And again: "To him who
hath founded the earth upon the waters." What sayest thou? The water is
not able to support a small pebble on its surface, and yet bears up the
earth, great as it is; and mountains, and hills, and cities, and plants, and
men, and brutes; and it is not submerged! What do I say? Is not
submerged? How comes it to pass, that since the water has been in close
contact with it below, during so long a period, it has not been dissolved,
and the whole of it become mud? For the substance of wood, when soaked
in water but a little time, is rotted and dissolved; and why do I say of
wood? What can be firmer than iron? yet often this is softened, when it
remains a long time in water; and well it may. For it derives its substance
from the earth. Therefore many run-away servants, when they make their
escape, dragging their shackles and chains along with them, go to brooks of
water, and thrust their shackled feet therein, and after making the iron
softer by this means, they easily break it by striking it with a stone. Iron,
forsooth, is softened, and wood is rotted, and stones are worn away by
the nature of water; yet so great a mass as the earth hath remained such a
length of time lying upon the waters, without being either submerged, or
dissolved, and destroyed!

8. And who is there that must not feel astonished and amazed at these
things; and confidently pronounce that they are not the works of nature,
but of that Providence which is above nature? Therefore one speaks thus:
"Who hangeth the earth upon nothing." And another observes, "In His
hands are the corners of the earth." And again: "He hath laid the
foundation of it upon the seas." And these declarations, though they seem
contrary to one another, have yet an entire agreement. For he that said,
"He hath laid the foundation of it upon the seas," meant the same thing as
he did who declared, "He hath hung it upon nothing." For its standing
upon the waters is just the same thing as hanging upon nothing. Where

then is it suspended and placed? Hear the same one saying, "In His hands
are the corners of the earth." Not that God hath hands, but that thou
mayest know that His power it is, providing for all things which holds
together and supports the body of the earth! But if thou believest not
what I now say, believe what thou beholdest! for even in another element
it is possible to find this admirable workmanship. For it is the nature of
fire to tend upwards, and to be always mounting aloft; and although you
force and constrain it never so much, it cannot submit to have its course
directed downwards. For often, when we are carrying a lighted torch,
although we incline its head downwards, we cannot compel the force of
the flame to direct itself to the ground; but still it turns upward, and
passes from below toward that which is above. But with respect to the
sun, God hath made it quite the contrary. For He hath turned his beams
toward the earth, and made his light to direct itself downward, all but
saying to him by the very shape (of the heavens), "Look downward. -
Shine upon men, for thou wert made for them!" The light, indeed, of a
candle cannot be made to submit to this; but this star, great and marvelous
as it is, bends downward, and looks toward the earth, which is contrary to
the nature of fire; owing to the power of Him who hath commanded it.
Wouldest thou have me speak of another thing of the like kind? Waters
embrace the back of the visible heaven on all parts; and yet they neither
flow down, nor are moved out of their place, although the nature of water
is not of this kind. For it easily runs together into what is concave; but
when the body is of a convex form, it glides away on all sides; and not
even a small portion is capable of standing upon such a figure. But, lo! this
wonder is found to exist in the heavens; and the prophet, again, to intimate
this very circumstance, observes, "Praise the Lord, ye waters that are
above the heavens." Besides, the water hath not quenched the sun; nor
hath the sun, which hath gone on his way beneath for so long a time, dried
up the water that lies above.

9. Dost thou desire that we should lead thee down again to the earth, and
point out the marvel? Seest thou not this sea abounding with waves, and
fierce winds; yet this sea, spacious, and large, and furious as it is, is walled
in with a feeble sand! Mark also the wisdom of God, He permitted it not
to be at rest, nor tranquil, lest thou shouldest suppose its good order to be
of mere natural regulation; but remaining within its limits, it lifts up its

voice, and is in tumult, and roars aloud, and raises its waves to a
prodigious height. But when it comes to the shores, and beholds the sand,
it breaks up, and returns back again within itself; teaching thee, by both
these things, that it is not the work of nature that it remains within its
boundaries, but the work of Him whose power restrains it! For this cause
accordingly He hath made the wall feeble; and hath not encompassed these
shores with wood, or stone, or mountains, lest thou shouldest impute the
regulation of the elements to such things. And, therefore, God Himself,
upbraiding the Jews with this very circumstance, said, "Fear ye not Me,
which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea that it cannot pass it."
But the marvelous thing is not this only, that He hath made a great and
admirable world; and that He hath compacted it in a way above the usual
course of nature; but that He hath also constituted it out of opposite
things; such as hot and cold, dry and moist, fire and water, earth and air,
and that these contrary elements, of which this whole universe consists,
though continually at strife one with another, are not consumed of one
another. The fire hath not overrun and burnt up all things; the water hath
not overflowed and drowned the whole earth. With respect to our bodies,
however, these effects really take place; and upon the increase of the bile,
fever is generated; and the whole animal frame sustains an injury; and
when there is a superabundance of phlegm, many diseases are produced
which destroy the animal. But in the case of the universe, nothing of this
kind happens; but each thing remains held as it were by a kind of bridle
and band; preserving, by the will of the Creator, its own boundaries; and
their strife becomes a source of peace to the whole. Are not these things
evident even to a blind man? and are not even the simple easily able to
comprehend, that they were made, and are upheld, by some Providence?
For who is so silly and senseless, that beholding such a mass of
substances, such beauty, such combination, the continual strife of such
vast elements, their opposition, and yet durability, would not reason with
himself and say, "If there were not some Providence to uphold the mass of
these bodies, not permitting the universe to fall to pieces, it could not
remain; it could not have been lasting. So perfect is the order of the
seasons, such the harmony of the day and night, so many the kinds of
brute animals, and plants, and seeds, and herbs, that preserve their course,
and yet, to the present day, none has ever fallen into decay or sudden
dissolution.

10. We might continue to speak not only of these things, but also of many
others, which are even more profound; and might moralize even upon the
Creation itself; but reserving these subjects for the morrow, let us
earnestly endeavor to retain what has been said, and to convey it to the
rest. I know indeed, that the abstruseness of these speculations has
seemed strange to your ears; but if we be a little vigilant, and accustom
ourselves to them, we shall easily be able to teach others. Meanwhile, it is
necessary farther to say this to your Charity. Even as God hath given us
glory by means of this great creation, so let us also glorify Him by, a pure
conversation! "The heavens declare the glory of God," though only seen;
and we therefore should declare God's glory not only in speaking, but in
silence, and in astonishing all men by the brightness of our life. For He
saith, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." For when an
unbeliever beholds thee, who art a believer, subdued, modest, and orderly
in manners, he will wonder and say, "Truly great is the God of the
Christians! What manner of men hath He formed? What, and from what
hath He made them? Hath He turned them from men into angels? If any
one treats them contemptuously, they revile not! If any one beats them,
they are not enraged! If any one does them an injury, they pray for him
who has put them in pain! They have no enemy! They know nothing of
cherishing malice! They are guiltless of vain babbling! They have not learnt
to utter a falsehood! They cannot endure a false oath, or rather, they swear
not at all, but would prefer to have their tongue cut out, rather than to let
an oath proceed out of their mouth!" Such are the things which we should
give them cause to say of us; and we should exterminate our evil habit of
oaths, and pay at least as much honor to God, as we do to our more
valuable garments. For how truly absurd is it, that when we have one
garment better than the rest, we do not suffer ourselves to be continually
wearing it; and yet everywhere we draggle about the name of God without
concern, or ceremony! Let us not, I earnestly pray and beseech you, let us
not thus despise our own salvation; but the care which we have used
respecting this precept from the beginning, let us carry on even to the end.
For I thus continually exhort you on the subject of oaths, not as though
condemning you of listlessness, but inasmuch as I have seen that ye are for
the most part reformed, I press you, and am urgent, that the whole work
should be finished off, and come to its perfection. Even so act the

spectators of public games. They excite those who are near the prize, with
the more vehemence. Let us, then, by no means become weary; for we
have nearly reached the completion of this amendment; and the difficulty
was at the beginning. But nosy that the greater part of the evil habit has
been cut away, and less remains to correct, no labor is necessary, but we
only need a moderate degree of watchfulness, and diligence for some short
time, in order that we ourselves being amended, may also become
instructors to others; and that we may behold the Holy Passover with
much confidence, and that with much pleasure we may reap a double or
treble measure of the customary gladness of the festival. For not so much
does it delight us to be delivered from the toil and fatigue of fasting, as to
meet that holy season with an illustrious and well-earned crown; a crown
indeed that is never to fade!

11. But in order that the amendment may take place the more quickly, do
this which I tell thee. Inscribe upon the wall of thy house, and upon the
wall of thy heart, that "flying sickle;" and think that it is flying forth on
occasion of the curse, and constantly remember it. And if thou observest
another person swearing, restrain, forbid, and be careful for him, and be
careful for thine own domestics. For if we would look to this, that we
might not merely correct ourselves, but also bring others to the same
point, we shall ourselves quickly arrive at the goal; since while we
undertake to instruct others, we shall be ashamed and blush, should we in
our own case seem to leave those things unperformed, which we enjoin
upon them. There is no need to say more; for much has been already
spoken on these matters; and these things are now said only by way of
remembrance. But may God, who is more sparing of our souls than we are,
make us perfect in this, and every good work; that so having completed
the whole fruit of righteousness, we may be found worthy of the kingdom
of heaven, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through Whom, and with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be
glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 10

Commendation of those who came to hear after taking a meal. -
Observations on the physiology of the natural world; and against
those who deify the creation; and on the duty of not swearing.

1. I JOY, and rejoice with you all, that ye have actually put in practice that
admonition of ours, which we lately made with respect to those who were
absent, for the reason that they were not fasting. For I think that many of
those who have dined are today present; and go to fill up this goodly
assemblage; and that this is the fact, I conjecture from the more brilliant
spectacle that I see around me, and the greater concourse of hearers. Not in
vain, it seems, did I lately spend so many words on their account,
appealing to your Charity, to draw them to their Mother; and to persuade
them that it is lawful, even after bodily nourishment, to partake also of
that which is spiritual. And in which case, beloved, I ask, did ye act for the
better; at the time of the last assembly when after your meal ye turned to
your slumbers; or now, when after the meal ye have presented yourselves
at the hearing of the divine laws? Was it best when ye loitered about in the
forum, and took part in meetings which were no wise profitable; or now,
when ye stand with your own brethren, and hear the prophetic oracles? It
is no disgrace, beloved, to have eaten, but after eating to remain at home,
and so to be deprived of this sacred banquet. For whilst thou remainest at
home, thou wilt be more slothful and supine; but coming here thou wilt
shake off all slumber and listlessness; and laying aside not only
listlessness, but also all sadness, thou wilt be more at ease, and in better
heart in all the events that may happen.

2. What need then is there to say more? Stand only nigh the man who
fasts, and thou wilt straightway partake of his good odor; for fasting is a
spiritual perfume; and through the eyes, the tongue, and every part, it
manifests the good disposition of the soul. I have said this, not for the
purpose of condemning those who have dined, but that I may shew the
advantage of fasting. I do not, however, call mere abstinence from meats,
fasting; but even before this, abstinence from sin; since he who, after he
has taken a meal, has come hither with suitable sobriety, is not very far
behind the man who fasts; even as he who continues fasting, if he does not

give earnest and diligent heed to what is spoken, will derive no great
benefit from his fast. He who eats, and yet takes a part in the sacred
assembly with suitable earnestness, is in much better case than he who
eats not at all, and remains absent. This abstinence will by no means be
able to benefit us as much as the participation in spiritual instruction
conveyeth to us benefit and advantage. Where indeed, besides, wilt thou
hear the things upon which thou meditatest here? Wert thou to go to the
bench of justice? quarrels and contentions are there! or into the
council-chamber? there is anxious thought about political matters! or to
thine home? solicitude on the, subject of thy private affairs afflicts thee in
every direction! or wert thou to go to the conferences and debates of the
forum? every thing there is earthly and corruptible! For all the words that
pass among those assembled there, are concerning merchandise, or taxes, or
the sumptuous table, or the sale of lands, or other contracts, or wills, or
inheritances, or some other things of that kind. And shouldest thou enter
even into the royal halls, there again thou wouldest hear in the same way
all discoursing of wealth, or power, or of the glory which is held in honor
here, but of nothing that is spiritual. But here on the contrary everything
relates to heaven, and heavenly things; to our soul, to our life, the purpose
for which we were born, and why We spend an allotted time upon earth,
and on what terms we migrate from hence, and into what condition we
shall enter after these things, and why our body is of clay, what also is the
nature of death, what, in short, the present life is, and what the future. The
discourses that are here made by us contain nothing at all of an earthly
kind, but are all in reference to spiritual things. Thus, then, it is that we
shall have made great provision for our salvation, and shall depart hence
with a good hope.

3. Since, therefore, we did not scatter the seed in vain, but ye hunted out
all who were absent, as I exhorted you; suffer us now to return you a
recompense; and having reminded you of a few things that were said
before, to repay you again what remains. What then were those matters
that were before treated of? We were enquiring how, and in what manner,
before the giving of the Scriptures, God ordered His dispensation toward
us; and we said, that by means of the creation He instructed our race,
stretching out the heavens, and there openly unfolding a vast volume,
useful alike to the simple and the wise, to the poor and to the rich, to

Scythians and to barbarians, and to all in general who dwell upon the earth;
a volume which is much larger than the multitude of those instructed by it.
We discoursed also at length concerning the night, and the day, and the
order of these, as well as of the harmony which is strictly preserved by
them; and much was said respecting the measured dance of the seasons of
the year, and of their equality. For just as the day defraudeth not the night
even of half an hour throughout the whole year, so also do these distribute
all the days among themselves equally. But, as I said before, not only does
the greatness and beauty of the creation shew forth the Divine Architect,
but the very manner likewise in which it is compacted together, and the
method of operation, transcending as it does, the ordinary course of
nature. For it would have been in accordance with nature for water to be
born upon the earth; but now we see, on the contrary, that the earth is
supported by the waters. It would have been in accordance with nature
that fire should tend upwards; but now on the contrary we see the beams
of the sun directed towards the earth; and the waters to be above the
heavens, yet not falling away; and the sun running below them, yet not
quenched by the waters, nor dispelling their moisture. Besides these things
we said that this whole universe consists of four elements, these being
adverse to and at strife with one another; yet one does not consume the
other, although they are mutually destructive. Whence it is evident that
some invisible power bridles them, and the will of God becomes their
bond.

4. Today, I wish to dwell a little more on this subject. Arouse yourselves,
however, and give earnest heed unto us! And that the wonder may appear
more clearly, I will draw the lesson concerning these things from our own
bodies. This body of ours, so short, and small, consists of four elements;
viz. of what is warm, that is, of blood; of what is dry, that is, of yellow
bile; of what is moist, that is, of phlegm; of what is cold, that is, of black
bile. And let no one think this subject foreign to that which we have in
hand. "For He that is spiritual judgeth all things; yet He Himself is judged
of no man." Thus also Paul touched upon principles of agriculture, whilst
discoursing to us of the Resurrection; and said, "Thou fool; that which
thou sowest is not quickened, except it die." But if that blessed man
brought forward questions of agriculture, neither should any one blame us
if we handle matters pertaining to medical science. For our discourse is

now respecting the Creation of God; and this ground-work of ideas will be
necessary for our purpose. As, therefore, I said before, this body of ours
consists of four elements; and if either revolts against the whole, death is
the result of this revolt. As for instance, by a superabundance "of bile"
fever is produced; and should this proceed beyond a certain measure, it
effects a rapid dissolution. Again, when there is an excess of the cold
element, paralyses, agues, apoplexies, and an infinite number of other
maladies are generated. And every form of disease is the effect of an excess
of these elements; when either of them overpassing its own bounds, acts
the part of a tyrant against the rest, and mars the symmetry of the whole.
Interrogate then him who says, that all things are spontaneous and
self-produced. If this little and diminutive body, having the advantage of
medicines, and of medical skill, and of a soul within which regulates it, and
of much moral wisdom, as well as innumerable other helps, be not always
able to continue in a state of order, but often perishes, and is destroyed,
when some disturbance takes place within it; how could a world like this,
containing substances of such vast bulk and compounded of those same
elements, remain during so long a time without any disturbance, unless it
enjoyed the advantage of a manifold providence? Neither would it be
reasonable to suppose that this body, which has the benefit of
superintendence both without and within, should scarcely be sufficient for
its own preservation; and that a world such as this is, enjoying no such
superintendence, should during so many years suffer nothing of that sort
which our body suffers. For how, I ask, is it that not one of these elements
hath gone beyond its own boundaries, nor swallowed up all the rest? Who
hath brought them together from the beginning? Who hath bound? Who
hath bridled? Who hath held them together during so long a period? For if
the body of the world were simple and uniform, what I speak of would
not have been so impossible. But when there hath been such a strife
between the elements, even from the beginning; who so senseless as to
think that these things would have come together, and remained together
when united, without One to effect this conjunction? For if we who are
evil-affected towards one another not by nature, but by will, cannot come
spontaneously to an agreement as long as we remain at variance, and hold
ourselves ungraciously towards one another; if we have yet need of some
one else to bring us into a state of conjunction; and after this conjunction
further to clench us, and persuade us to abide by our reconciliation, and

not again to be at variance; how could the elements, which neither partake
of sense nor reason, and which are naturally adverse, and inimical to each
other, have come together, and agreed and remained with one another, if
there were not some ineffable Power which effected this conjunction; and
after this conjunction, always restrained them by the same bond?

5. Dost thou not perceive how this body wastes away, withers, and
perishes after the secession of the soul, and each of the elements thereof
returns to its own appointed place? This very same thing, indeed, would
also happen to the world, if the Power which always governs it had left it
devoid of Its own providence. For if a ship does not hold together without
a pilot, but soon founders, how could the world have held together so long
a time if there was no one governing its, course? And that I may not
enlarge, suppose the world to be a ship; the earth to be placed below as
the keel; the sky to be the sail; men to be the passengers; the subjacent
abyss, the sea. How is it then that during so long a time, no shipwreck has
taken place? Now let a ship go one day without a pilot and crew, and thou
wilt see it straightway foundering! But the world, though subsisting now
five thousand years, and many more, hath suffered nothing of the kind.
But why do I talk of a ship? Suppose one hath pitched a small hut in the
vineyards; and when the fruit is gathered, leaves it vacant; it stands,
however, scarce two or three days, but soon goes to pieces, and tumbles
down! Could not a hut, forsooth, stand without superintendence? How
then could the workmanship of a world, so fair and marvelous; the laws of
the night and day; the interchanging dances of the seasons; the course of
nature chequered and varied as it is in every way throughout the earth, the
sea, the sky; in plants, and in animals that fly, swim, walk, creep; and in
the race of men, far more dignified than any of these, continue yet
unbroken, during so long a period, without some kind of providence? But
in addition to what has been said, follow me whilst I enumerate the
meadows, the gardens, the various tribes of flowers; all sorts of herbs, and
their uses; their odors, forms, disposition, yea, but their very names; the
trees which are fruitful, and which are barren; the nature of metals, - and
of animals, - in the sea, or on the land; of those that swim, and those that
traverse the air; the mountains, the forests, the groves; the meadow below,
and the meadow above; for there is a meadow on the earth, and a meadow
too in the sky; the various flowers of the stars; the rose below, and the

rainbow above! Would you have me point out also the meadow of birds?
Consider the variegated body of the peacock, surpassing every dye, and
the fowls of purple plumage. Contemplate with me the beauty of the sky;
how it has been preserved so long without being dimmed; and remains as
bright and clear as if it had been only fabricated today; moreover, the
power of the earth, how its womb has not become effete by bringing forth
during so long a time! Contemplate with me the fountains; how they burst
forth and fail not, since the time they were begotten, to flow forth
continually throughout the day and night! Contemplate with me the sea,
receiving so many rivers, yet never exceeding its measure! But how long
shall we pursue things unattainable! It is fit, indeed, that over every one of
these which has been spoken of, we should say, "O Lord, how hast Thou
magnified Thy works; in wisdom hast Thou made them all."

6. But what is the sapient argument of the unbelievers. when we go over
all these particulars with them; the magnitude, the beauty of the creation,
the prodigality, the munificence everywhere displayed? This very thing,
say they, is the worst fault, that God hath made the world so beautiful and
so vast. For if He had not made it beautiful and vast, we should not have
made a God of it; but now being struck with its grandeur, and marveling at
its beauty, we have thought it to be a deity. But such an argument is good
for nothing. For that neither the magnitude, nor beauty of the world is the
cause of this impiety, but their own want of understanding, is what we are
prepared to show, proved by the case of ourselves, who have never been
so affected. Why then have "we" not made a deity of it? Do we not see it
with the same eyes as themselves? Do we not enjoy the same advantage
from the creation with themselves? Do we not possess the same soul?
Have we not the same body? Do we not tread the same earth? How comes
it that this beauty and magnitude hath not persuaded us to think the same
as they do? But this will be evident not from this proof only, but from
another besides. For as a proof that it is not for its beauty they have made
a deity of it, but by reason of their own folly, why do they adore the ape,
the crocodile, the dog, and the vilest of animals? Truly, "they became vain
in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing
themselves to be wise, they became fools."

7. Nevertheless, we will not frame our answer from these things only, but
will also say something yet further. For God, foreseeing these things of

old, destroyed, in His wisdom, this plea of theirs. On this account He
made the world not only wonderful and vast, but also corruptible and
perishable; and placed therein many evidences of its weakness; and what
He did with respect to the Apostles, He did with respect to the whole
world. What then did He with respect to the Apostles? Since they used to
perform many great and astonishing signs and wonders, He suffered them
constantly to be scourged, to be expelled, to inhabit the dungeon, to
encounter bodily infirmities, to be in continual tribulations, lest the
greatness of their miracles should make them to be accounted as gods
amongst mankind. Therefore when He had bestowed so great favor upon
them, He suffered their bodies to be mortal, and in many cases obnoxious
to disease; and did not remove their infirmity, that He might give full proof
of their nature. And this is not merely my assertion, but that of Paul
himself, who says, "For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a
fool; but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which
he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me." And again, "But we have this
treasure in earthen vessels." But what is meant by "earthen vessels?" In
this body, he means, which is mortal and perishable. For just as the
earthen vessel is formed from clay and fire, so also the body of these
saints being clay, and receiving the energy of the spiritual fire, becomes an
earthen vessel. But for what reason was it thus constituted, and so great a
treasure, and such a plentitude of graces entrusted to a mortal and
corruptible body? "That the excellency of the power may be of God, and
not of us." For when thou seest the Apostles raising the dead, yet
themselves sick, and unable to remove their own infirmities, thou mayest
clearly perceive, that the resurrection of the dead man was not effected by
the power of him who raised him, but by the energy of the Spirit. For in
proof, that they were frequently sick, hear what Paul saith respecting
Timothy, "Use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thine often
infirmities." And again, of another he saith, "But Trophimus I have left at
Miletus sick." And writing to the Philippians, he said, "Epaphroditus was
sick nigh unto death." For if, when this was the case, they accounted them
to be gods, and prepared to do sacrifice unto them, saying, "The gods are
come down to us in the likeness of men;" had such infirmities not existed,
to what extent of impiety might not men have proceeded, when they
beheld their miracles? As then in this case, because of the greatness of
these signs, He suffered their nature to remain in a state of infirmity, and

permitted those repeated trials, in order that they might not be thought to
be gods, thus likewise He did with respect to the creation, a thing nearly
parallel to this. For He fashioned it beautiful and vast; but on the other
hand corruptible.

8. And both of these points the Scriptures teach, for one in treating of the
beauty of the heavens thus speaks "The heavens declare the glory of
God." And again, "Who hath placed the sky as a vault, and spread it out
as a tent over the earth." And again, "Who holdeth the circle of heaven."
But another writer, shewing that although the world be great and fair, it is
yet corruptible, thus speaks; "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands.
They shall perish, but Thou remainest, and they all shall wax old as doth a
garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, and they shall be
changed." And again, David saith of the sun, that "he is as a bridegroom
coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course." Seest
thou how he places before thee the beauty of this star, and its greatness?
For even as a bridegroom when he appears from some stately chamber, so
the sun sends forth his rays under the East; and adorning the heaven as it
were with a saffron-colored veil, and making the clouds like roses, and
running unimpeded all the day; he meets no obstacle to interrupt his
course. Beholdest thou, then, his beauty? Beholdest thou his greatness?
Look also at the proof of his weakness! For a certain wise man, to make
this plain, said, "What is brighter than the sun, yet the light thereof suffers
eclipse." Nor is it only from this circumstance that his infirmity is to be
perceived, but also in the concourse Of the clouds. Often, at least, when a
cloud passes underneath him, though emitting his beams, and endeavoring
to pierce through it, he has not strength to do so; the cloud being too
dense, and not suffering him to penetrate through it. "He nourishes the
seeds, however," replies some one - Yes - still he does not nourish
them by himself, but requires the assistance of the earth, and of the dew,
and of the rains, and of the winds, and the right distribution of the seasons.
And unless all these things concur, the sun's aid is but superfluous. But
this would not seem to be like a deity, to stand in need of the assistance of
others, for that which he wishes to do; for it is a special attribute of God
to want nothing; He Himself at least did not in this manner bring forth the
seeds from the ground; He only commanded, and they all shot forth. And

again, that thou mayest learn that it is not the nature of the elements, but
His command which effects all things; He both brought into being these
very elements which before were not; and without the need of any aid, He
brought down the manna for the Jews. For it is said, "He gave them bread
from heaven." But why do I say, that in order to the perfection of fruits,
the sun requires the aid of other elements for their sustenance; when he
himself requires the assistance of many things for his sustenance, and
would not himself be sufficient for himself. For in order that he may
proceed on his way, he needs the heaven as a kind of pavement spread out
underneath him; and that he may shine, he needs the clearness and rarity of
the air; since if even this become unusually dense, he is not able to show
his light; and, on the other hand, he requires coolness and moisture, lest his
rays should be intolerable to all, and burn up everything. When, therefore,
other elements. overrule him, and correct his weakness (overrule as for
example, clouds, and walls, and certain other bodies that intercept his light:
- or correct his excess, as the dews, and fountains, and cool air), how can
such a one be a Deity? For God must be independent, and not stand in
need of assistance, be the source of all good things to all, and be hindered
by nothing; even as Paul, as well as the prophet Isaiah, saith of God; the
latter thus making Him speak in His own Person, "I fill heaven and earth,
saith the Lord." And again, "Am I a God nigh at hand, and not a God afar
off?" And again, David says, "I have said unto the Lord, Thou art my
Lord, for Thou hast no need of my good things." But Paul, demonstrating
this independence of help, and shewing that both these things especially
belong to God; to stand in need of nothing, and of Himself to supply all
things to all; speaks on this wise, "God that made the heaven, and the
earth, and the sea, Himself needeth not any thing, giving to all life and all
things."

9. It would indeed be easy for us to take a survey of the other elements,
the heaven, the air, the earth, the sea, and to shew the imbecility of these,
and how each requires the assistance of his neighbor, and without this
assistance, is lost and destroyed. For as it regards the earth, if the
fountains fail it, and the moisture infused from the sea and the rivers, it
quickly perishes by being parched. The remaining elements too stand in
need of one another. the air of the sun, as well as the sun of the air. But
not to protract this discourse; in what has been said, having given a

sufficient supply of reasons to start from for those who are willing to
receive them, we shall be content. For if the sun, which is the most
surprising part of the whole creation, hath been proved to be so feeble and
needy, how much more the other parts of the universe? What then I have
advanced (offering these things for the consideration of the studious), I
will myself again shew you in discourse from the Scriptures; and prove,
that not only the sun, but also the whole universe is thus corruptible. For
since the elements are mutually destructive. and when much cold
intervenes, it chastens the force of the sun's rays; and on the other hand,
the heat prevailing, consumes the cold; and since the elements are both the
causes and subjects of contrary qualities, and dispositions, in one another;
it is very evident that these things offer a proof of great corruptibility; and
of the fact, that all these things which are visible, are a corporeal
substance.

10. But since this subject is too lofty for our simplicity, permit me now to
lead you to the sweet fountain of the Scriptures, that we may refresh your
ears. For we will not discourse to you of the heaven and the earth
separately, but will exhibit the Apostle declaring this very thing to us
concerning the whole creation, in these plain terms, that the whole creation
is now in bondage to corruption; and why it is thus in bondage, and at
what time it shall be delivered from it, and unto what condition it shall be
translated. For after he had said, "The sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us;" he
goes on to add; "For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to
vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same
in hope." But what he intends is to this effect; "The creature," he says,
"was made corruptible;" for this is implied in the expression, "being made
subject to vanity." For it was made corruptible by the command of God.
But God so commanded it for the sake of our race; for since it was to
nurture a corruptible man, it was necessary itself should also be of the
same character; for of course corruptible bodies were not to dwell in an
incorruptible creation. But, nevertheless, he tells us, it will not remain so.
"The creature also itself shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption;" and afterwards, for the purpose of shewing when this event
shall take place, and through whom, he adds, "Into the glorious liberty of

the sons of God." For when we are raised, his meaning is, and assume
incorruptible bodies; then also this body of the heaven, the earth, and the
whole creation, shall be incorruptible, and imperishable. When, therefore,
thou beholdest the sun arising, admire the Creator; when thou beholdest
him hiding himself and disappearing, learn the weakness of his nature, that
thou mayest not adore him as a Deity! For God hath not only implanted
in the nature of the elements this proof of their weakness, but hath also
bidden His servants, that were but men, command them; so that although
thou shouldest not know their servitude from their aspect, thou mayest
learn, from those who have commanded them, that they are all thy
fellow-servants. Therefore it was, that Joshua, the son of Nave, said, "Let
the sun stand still in Gibeon, and the moon over against the valley of
Ajalon.' And again the prophet Isaiah made the sun to retrace his steps,
under the reign of Hezekiah; and Moses gave orders to the air, and the sea,
the earth, and the rocks. Elisha changed the nature of the waters; the Three
Children triumphed over the fire. Thou seest how God hath provided for
us on either hand; leading us by the beauty of the elements to the
knowledge of His divinity; and, by their feebleness, not permitting us to
lapse into the worship of them.

11. For the sake of all these things then, let us glorify Him, our Guardian;
not only by words, but also by deeds; and let us shew forth an excellent
conversation, not only in general, but in particular with regard to
abstinence from oaths. For not every sin brings the same penalty; but
those which are easiest to be amended, bring upon us the greatest
punishment: which indeed Solomon intimated, when he said, "It is not
wonderful if any one be taken stealing; for he stealeth that he may satisfy
his soul that is hungry; but the adulterer, by the lack of understanding,
destroyeth his own soul." But what he means is to this effect. The thief is
a grievous offender, but not so grievous a one as the adulterer: for the
former, though it be a sorry reason for his conduct, yet at the same time
has to plead the necessity arising from indigence; but the latter, when no
necessity compels him, by his mere madness rushes into the gulf of
iniquity. This also may be said with regard to those who swear. For they
have not any pretext to allege, but merely their contempt.

12. I know, indeed, that I may seem to be too tedious and burdensome;
and that I may be thought to give annoyance by continuing this

admonition. But nevertheless, I do not desist, in order that ye may even be
shamed by my shamelessness to abstain from the custom of oaths. For if
that unmerciful and cruel judge, paying respect to the importunity of the
widow, changed his custom, much more will ye do this; and especially
when he who is exhorting you, doth it not for himself, but for your
salvation. Or rather, indeed, I cannot deny that I do this for myself; for I
consider your benefit as my own success. But I could wish that you, even
as I labor, and weary myself for your safety, would in like manner make
your own souls a matter of anxiety to yourselves; and then assuredly this
work of reformation would be perfected. And what need is there to
multiply words? For if there were no hell, neither punishment for the
contumacious, nor reward for the obedient; and I had come to you, and
asked this in the way of a favor, would ye not have consented? would ye
not have granted my petition, when I asked so trifling a favor? But when it
is God who asks this favor, and for the sake of yourselves, who are to
grant it, and not for Himself, Who is to receive it; who is there so
ungracious, who is there so miserable and wretched, that he will not grant
this favor to God, when He asks it; and especially when he himself who
grants it, is in future to enjoy the benefit of it? Considering these things
then, repeat over to yourselves, when ye depart hence, all that has been
said; and correct in every way those who take no heed to it; to the end that
we may receive the recompense of other men's good actions, as well as our
own, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
Whom, and with Whom be glory to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, for
ever and ever. Amen.

HOMILY 11

Thanksgiving to God for deliverance from the evils expected owing
to the sedition; and recollection of the events which took place at the
time. Also against those who find fault with the structure of the
human body, and in general concerning the creation of man; and,
in conclusion, on success in avoiding oaths.

1. WHEN I think of the past tempest, and of the present calm, I cease not
saying, "Blessed be God, who maketh all things, and changeth them; who
hath brought light out of darkness; who leadeth to the gates of hell, and
bringeth back; who chastiseth, but killeth not." And this I desire you too
to repeat constantly, and never to desist. For if He hath benefited us by
deeds, what pardon shall we deserve, if we do not requite Him even by
words. Therefore, I exhort that we never cease to give Him thanks; since if
we are grateful for the former benefits, it is plain that we shall enjoy others
also, which are greater. Let us say, then, continually, Blessed be God, who
hath permitted us to spread before you in security the accustomed table,
whilst He hath also granted you to hear our word with assurance of
safety! Blessed be God, that we no longer run hither flying from the
danger without, but only from desire to hear; that we no longer meet one
another with agony, trembling, and anxious thoughts; but with much
confidence, having shaken off all our fear. Our condition, indeed, on former
days was nothing better than that of those who are tossed up and down in
the midst of the deep; and expecting shipwreck every hour. We were
scared all day long by innumerable rumors, and disturbed and agitated on
every side; and were every day busy and curious to know who had come
from the court? what news he had brought? and whether what was
reported was true or false? Our nights too we passed without sleep, and
whilst we looked upon the city, we wept over it, as if it were on the eve of
its destruction.

2. For this cause yourselves too kept silence on those former days,
because the whole city was empty, and all had migrated to the deserts, and
because those who were left behind were overshadowed by the cloud of
despondency. For the soul when once it is filled with despondency, is not
apt to hear anything that may be said. For this cause, when the friends of

Job came, and saw that tragedy of his house, and the just man sitting down
upon the dunghill, and covered with sores, they rent their garments, and
groaned and sat down by him in silence; making it manifest that nothing is
so suitable to the afflicted at first, as quiet and silence. For the calamity
was too great for consolation. Therefore also the Jews, whilst they were in
bondage to work in clay and the brick-making, when they saw Moses
come to them, were not able to give heed to his words, by reason of their
failure of spirit, and their affliction. And what marvel is it that
faint-hearted men have felt this, when we find that the Disciples also fell
into the same infirmity. For after that mystic Supper, when Christ took
them apart and discoursed with them, the disciples at first asked Him
more than once, "Whither goest Thou?" But when He had told them what
evils they should in a little while afterwards encounter, the wars, and the
persecutions, and the universal enmity, the stripes, the prisons, the
tribunals, the appearance before magistrates; then, their souls oppressed as
by a heavy burden with the dread of the things He had spoken, and with
the sadness of these approaching events, remained henceforth in a state of
stupor. Christ, therefore, perceiving their consternation, reproved it by
saying, "I go to My Father, and no one among you asketh Me, Whither
goest Thou? But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath
filled your hearts." For this reason also we were silent for some time past,
awaiting the present opportunity. For if a person who is about to ask a
favor of any one, though the request be a reasonable one, waits a fitting
occasion to propose it, that he may find him who is to grant the petition in
a mild and well-disposed frame of mind; and that receiving assistance from
the favorable opportunity, he may obtain the benefit; how much rather is
it necessary that the speaker should seek a fit season, so that he may
address his discourse to an auditor well affected, and free from all care and
despondency; which accordingly we have done.

3. Inasmuch, then, as ye haste now shaken off despondency, we are
desirous to recall you to the recollection of former matters; so that our
discourse may be rendered the clearer to you. For what we said of the
creation, that God not only made it beautiful, and wonderful, and vast, but
also weak and corruptible; and moreover that He hath established divers
proofs of this; ordering both these circumstances for our advantage; leading
us on by its beauty to admiration of Him who framed it: and by its

weakness leading us away from the worship of the creature; this we may
see, take place also in the case of the body. For with respect to this too
there are many among the enemies to the truth, as well as among those
who belong to our own ranks, who make it a subject of enquiry, why it
was created corruptible and frail? Many also of the Greeks and heretics
affirm, that it was not even created by God, For they declare it to be
unworthy of God's creative art, and enlarge upon its impurities, its sweat,
its tears, its labors, and sufferings, and all the other incidents of the body.
But, for my part, when such things are talked of, I would first make this
reply. Tell me not of man, fallen, degraded and condemned. But if thou
wouldest learn what manner of body God formed us with at the first, let
us go to Paradise, and survey the Man that was created at the beginning.
For that body was not thus corruptible and mortal; but like as some statue
of gold just brought from the furnace, that shines splendidly, so that frame
was free from all corruption. Labor did not trouble it, nor sweat deface it.
Cares did not conspire against it; nor sorrows besiege it; nor was there any
other affection of that kind to distress it. But when man did not bear his
felicity with moderation, but threw contempt upon his Benefactor, and
thought a deceiving demon more worthy of credit than God who cared for
him, and who had raised him to honor, and when he expected to become
himself a God, and conceived thoughts above his proper dignity, then, -
then indeed it was that God, to humble him by decisive acts, made him
mortal, as well as corruptible; and lettered him with such varied
necessities; not from hatred or aversion, but in care for him, and to repress
at the very outset that evil and destructive pride; and instead of permitting
it to proceed any further, He admonished Him by actual experience, that
he was mortal and corruptible; thus to convince him that he must never
again think or dream of such things as he had done. For the devil's
suggestion, was, "Ye shall be as gods." Desiring then utterly to eradicate
this idea, God made the body subject to much suffering and disease; to
instruct him by its very nature that he must never again entertain such a
thought. And that this is true, is really most evident from what befell him;
for after such an expectation, he was condemned to this punishment.
Consider also with me the wisdom of God in this matter. He did not allow
him to be the first to die, but permitted his son to suffer this death; in
order that seeing before his eyes the body corrupting and decaying, he

might receive a striking lesson of wisdom from that spectacle; and learn
what had come to pass, and be duly chastened before he departed hence.

4. Really then, as I said, this point is apparent from what has already
taken place; but it will be made no less clear from what yet remains to be
stated. For if whilst we are lettered with such necessities of the body; and
whilst it is the lot of all men to die, to suffer corruption, to molder in the
sight of all, and to dissolve into dust, so that the Gentile philosophers
made one and the same comprehensive definition of the human race(for
when asked what man was, they answered, he is an animal, rational and
mortal); if, forsooth, whilst all admitted this, there were some who dared
in the opinion of the multitude to immortalize themselves; and
notwithstanding that the very sense of sight bore witness to their
mortality, were ambitious to be called gods, and were honored as such; to
what a length of impiety would not many men have proceeded, if death
had not gone on teaching all men the mortality and corruptibility of our
nature? Hear, for instance, what the prophet says of a barbarian king,
when seized with this frenzy. "I will exalt," saith he, "my throne above
the stars of heaven; and I will be like unto the Most High." Afterwards,
deriding him, and speaking of his death, he says, "Corruption is under
thee, and the worm is thy covering;" but his meaning is, "Dost thou dare,
O man, whom such an end is awaiting, to entertain such imaginations?"
Again, of another, I mean the king of the Tyrians, when he conceived the
like aims, and was ambitious to be considered as a God, he says, "Thou art
not a God, but a man, and they that pierce thee shall say so." Thus God,
in making this body of ours as it is, hath from the beginning utterly taken
away all occasion of idolatry.

5. But why dost thou marvel if this hath happened in respect to the body,
when even with respect to the soul it is plain, that a similar thing hath
taken place. For God made it not mortal, but permitted it to be immortal;
He constituted it however subject to forgetfulness, to ignorance, to
sadness, and to care; and this, lest regarding its own nobility of birth, it
might take up a conceit too high for its proper dignity. For if, even while
the case stands thus, some have dared to aver, that it is of the Divine
essence; to what a pitch of frenzy would they not have reached, if it had
been devoid of these imperfections? What, however, I affirmed respecting
the creation, I affirm also respecting the body, that both these things alike

excite my admiration of God; that He hath made it corruptible; and that in
its very corruptibility, He hath manifested His own power and wisdom.
For that He could have made it of some better material, He hath evidenced
from the celestial and the solar substance. For He that made those such as
they are, could have made this also like them, had He thought proper to do
so. But the cause of its imperfection is what I before adverted to. This
circumstance by no means lowers the admiration due to the Creator's
workmanship, but rather increases it; for the meanness of the substance,
manifests the resource and adaptiveness of His art; since He hath
introduced such a harmony of parts in clay and ashes, and senses so
various and manifold and capable of such spiritual wisdom.

6. In proportion, therefore, as thou findest fault with the meanness of the
substance, be so much the more astonished at the greatness of the art
displayed. For this reason also, I do not so much admire the statuary who
forms a beautiful figure out of gold, as him who, by the resources of art, is
able, even in crumbling clay, to exhibit a marvelous and inimitable mold of
beauty. In the former case, the material gives some aid to the artist, but in
the latter, there is a naked display of his art. Wouldest thou learn then,
how great the wisdom of the Creator is, consider what it is that is made
out of clay? What else is there but brick and the? Nevertheless, God, the
Supreme Artist, from the same material of which only the brick and the is
formed, hath been able to make an eye so beautiful, as to astonish all who
behold it, and to implant in it such power, that it can at once survey the
high aerial expanse, and by the aid of a small pupil embrace the mountains,
forests, hills, the ocean, yea, the heaven, by so small a thing! Tell me not
then of tears and rheums, for these things are the fruit of thy sin; but
consider its beauty, and visual power; and how it is that whilst it ranges
over such an expanse of air, it experiences no weariness or distress! The
feet indeed become tired and weakened even after going but a small
distance; but the eye, in traversing a space so lofty and so wide, is not
sensible of any infirmity. For since this is the most necessary to us of all
our members, He has not suffered it to be oppressed with fatigue; in order
that the service it renders us might be free and unfettered.

7. But rather, I should say, what language is fully adequate to set forth the
whole excellency of this member? And why do I speak of the pupil and
the visual faculty? for if you were to investigate that which seems the

meanest of all the members, I mean the eyelashes, you would behold even
in these the manifold wisdom of God the Creator! For as it is with respect
to the ears of corn; the beards, standing forth as a sort of spears, repel the
birds, and do not suffer them to settle upon the fruits, and to break the
stalk, which is too tender to bear them; so also is it with regard to the
eyes. The hairs of the eyelids are ranged in front, and answer the purpose
of beards and spears; keeping dust and light substances at a distance from
the eyes, and any thing that might incommode the sight; and not
permitting the eyelids to be annoyed. Another instance of wisdom, no less
remarkable, is to be observed in eyebrows. Who can help being struck by
their position? For they do not project to an immoderate degree, so as to
obscure the sight; nor do they retire farther back than is fitting; but in the
same manner as the caves of a house, they stand out above, receiving the
perspiration as it descends from the forehead, and not permitting it to
annoy the eyes. For this purpose too there is a growth of hair upon them,
which serves by its roughness to stay what descends from above, and
affords the exact protection that is needed, and contributes also much
appearance of beauty to the eyes. Nor is this the only matter of wonder!
There is another thing also which is equally so. How is it, I ask, that the
hairs of the head increase, and are cut off; but those of the eyebrows, not
so? For not even this has happened undesignedly, or by chance, but in
order that they might not darken the sight too much by becoming very
long; an inconvenience from which those suffer who have arrived at
extreme old age.

8. And who could possibly trace out all the wisdom which is manifested
by means of the brain! For, in the first place, He made it soft, since it
serves as a fountain to all the senses. Next, in order that it might not suffer
injury owing to its peculiar nature, He fortified it on every side with
bones. Further; that it might not suffer from friction, by the hardness of
the bones, He interposed a middle membrane: and not only a single one,
but also a second; the former being spread out on the under side of the
skull, but the latter enveloping the upper substance of the brain, and the
first being the harder of the two. And this was done, both for the cause
that has been mentioned, and in order that the brain might not be the first
to receive the blows inflicted upon the head; but that these membranes
first encountering them, might free it from all injury, and preserve it

unwounded. Moreover, that the bone which covers the brain is not a single
and continuous one, but has many sutures on every side, is a circumstance
which contributes much to its security. For a ventilation of the vapors that
surround it may easily take place outward through these sutures, so as to
prevent it from being suffocated; and if a blow should be inflicted upon it,
on any particular point, the damage does not extend to the whole. For if
the bone bad been one and continuous, the stroke even when it fell upon
one part, only, would have injured the whole; but now, by its being
divided into many parts, this can never happen. For if one part should
chance to be wounded, only the bone that is situated near that part
receives injury, but all the rest remain unhurt; the continuity of the stroke
being intercepted by the division of the bones, and being unable to extend
itself to the adjacent parts. By reason of this God hath constructed a
covering for the brain of many bones; and just as when one builds a house,
he lays on a roof, and tiles upon the upper part, so God hath placed these
bones above upon the head, and hath provided that the hairs should shoot
forth, and serve as a kind of cap for it.

9. The very same thing also He hath done with regard to the heart. For
inasmuch as the heart has preeminence over all the members in our body,
and that the supreme power over our whole life is entrusted to it, and
death happens when it receives but a slight blow; He hath fenced it about
on every side with stiff and hard bones, surrounding it by the protection
of the breast-bone before, and the blade-bones behind. And what He did
with respect to the membranes of the brain, He hath done in this instance
also. For in order that it might not be rubbed and pained in striking against
the hard bones which encompass it, in the throbbing and quick pulsation
to which it is subject in anger and similar affections, He both interposed
many membranes there, and placed the lungs by the side of it to act the
part of a soft bed to these pulsations, so that the heart may break its force
on these without sustaining injury or distress.

But why do I speak of the heart, and of the brain, when if any one will
investigate even the very nails, he will see the manifold wisdom of God
displayed in these; as well by their form, as by their substance and
position. I might also have mentioned why our fingers are not all equal,
and many other particulars besides; but to those who are inclined to
attend, the wisdom of God Who created us, will be sufficiently clear from

what has been said. Wherefore, leaving this department to be investigated
with diligence by those who are desirous of the task, I shall turn myself to
another objection.

10. There are many forsooth, who, besides what has been already referred
to, bring forward this objection. If man be the king of the brutes, why have
many animals an advantage over him in strength, agility, and fleetness? For
the horse is swifter, the ox is more enduring, the eagle is lighter, and the
lion stronger, than man. What then have we to reply to this argument?
Thus much; that from that circumstance we may especially discern the
wisdom of God and the honor which He has put upon us. A horse, it is
true, is swifter than man, but for making dispatch on a journey, the man is
better fitted than the horse. For a horse, though the very swiftest and
strongest that may be, can scarcely travel two hundred stadia in a day; but
a man, harnessing a number of horses in succession, will be able to
accomplish a distance of two thousand stadia. Thus, the advantage which
swiftness affords to the horse, intelligence and art afford to the man in a
much greater excess. The man, it is true, has not feet so strong as the other,
but then he has those of the other which serve him as well as his own. For
not one of the brutes has ever been able to subjugate another to his own
use; but man has the range of them all; and by that variety of skill which is
given him of God, makes each of the animals subservient to the
employment best suited to him. For if the feet of men had been as strong
as those of horses, they would have been useless for other purposes, for
difficult ground, for the summits of mountains, for climbing trees; for the
hoof is usually an impediment to treading in such places. So that although
the feet of men are softer than theirs, they are still adapted to more various
uses, and are not the worse for their want of strength, while they have the
power of the horse ministering to their aid, and at the same time they have
the advantage over him in variety of tread. Again, the eagle has his light
pinion; but I have reason and art, by which I am enabled to bring down and
master all the winged animals. But if thou wouldest see my pinion too, I
have one much lighter than he; one which can soar, not merely ten or
twenty stadia, or even as high as heaven, but above heaven itself, and
above the heaven of heavens; even to "where Christ sitteth at the right
hand of God!"

11. Again, the irrational animals have their weapons in their own body;
thus, the ox has his horns; the wild boar his tusks; the lion his claws. But
God hath not furnished the nature of my body with weapons, but hath
made these to be extraneous to it, for the purpose of shewing that man is a
gentle animal; and that I have not always occasion to use my weapons, for
from time to time I lay these aside, and from time to time resume them. In
order then that I might be free and unfettered in this matter, not being at all
times compelled to carry my weapons, He hath made these to be separate
from my nature. For it is not only in our possessing a rational nature that
we surpass the brutes, but we also excel them in body. For God has made
this to correspond with the soul's nobility, and fitted to execute its
commands. He has not, indeed, made the body such as it is, without
reason; but such as it ought to be, as having to minister to a rational soul;
so that if it were not such as it is, the operations of the soul would be
greatly impeded: and this is manifest from diseases. For if this nice
adjustment of the body be diverted from its proper condition in ever so
small a degree, many of the soul's energies are impeded; as, for instance, if
the brain should become too hot, or too cold. So that from the body it is
easy to see much of the Divine Providence, not only because He made it at
first better than it is at present; nor because even now He hath changed it
for a useful purpose, but also because He will raise it again to much greater
glory.

12. But, if thou art desirous to learn in a different way what wisdom God
hath shewn respecting the body, I will mention that by which Paul seems
most especially to be constantly struck. But what is this? That He hath
made the members to excel one another, though not in the same things?
Some He hath appointed to surpass the rest in beauty, and some in
strength. Thus, the eye is beautiful, but the feet are stronger. The head is
honorable, but it cannot say to the feet, "I have no need of you." And this
may be seen too with regard to irrational animals; and the same in all the
relations of life. The king, for instance, has need of his subjects, and the
subjects of the king; just as the head has need of the feet. And again, as to
brutes; some are more powerful than the rest; and some more beautiful.
Some there are that delight us; some that nourish; and some that clothe us.
Thus the peacock delights; and fowls and swine nourish; sheep and goats
provide us clothing; and the ox and ass share our labors. There are also

others which provide us with none of these, but which call our powers
into active exercise. Thus the wild animals increase the strength of the
hunters; and instruct our race by the fear which they inspire, and render us
more cautious; and for medical purposes, they supply no small
contributions from their bodies. So that if any one say to thee, "How art
thou a Lord of the brutes, whilst afraid of the lion?" Answer him, "Things
were not ordered in this manner at the beginning, when I was in favor with
God, when I dwelt in Paradise. But when I had offended my Master, I fell
under the power of those who were my servants! Yet not even now
entirely; since I possess an art by which I overcome the wild animals." So
also it happens in great houses; the sons, while they are yet under age, are
afraid of many of the servants; but when they have done amiss, their dread
is greatly heightened. And this we may say also of serpents, and
scorpions, and vipers; that they are formidable to us by reason of sin.

13. And not only as it regards our body, and the various states of life, is
this diversity observable; nor is it confined to brutes; but it may be seen
also in trees; and the meanest of them may be observed to have an
excellence above those which are greater; so that all things are not alike in
all, that all may be necessary to us; and that we may perceive the manifold
wisdom of the Lord. Do not then lay blame on God on account of the
body's corruptibleness, but for this the rather do Him homage, and admire
Him for His wisdom and His tender care; His wisdom, that in so
corruptible a body He hath been able to display such harmony; His tender
care that for the benefit of the soul He hath made it corruptible, that He
might repress her vanity, and subdue her pride! Why then did He not
make it thus from the beginning, asks some one? It was, I reply. to justify
Himself before thee by these very works; and as much as to say by the
result itself, "I called thee to greater honor, but thou didst constitute
thyself unworthy or the gift, banishing thyself from Paradise!
Nevertheless, I will not even now despise thee, but I will correct thy sin,
and bring thee back to heaven. Therefore for thine own sake, I have
permitted thee so long to decay and suffer corruption, that in the fullness
of time the discipline of thy humility might be established; and that thou
mightest never more resume thy former conceit.

14. For all these things then let us give thanks to God who loveth man; and
for His tender care over us, render Him a recompense, that will also be

profitable to ourselves; and as regards the commandment which I so
frequently discourse of to you, let us use our utmost diligence! For I will
not desist from the exhortation until ye are amended: seeing that what we
aim at is not that we may address you seldom or frequently, but that we
may continue speaking till we have persuaded you. To the Jews when
God said by the prophet, "If ye fast for strife and debate, to what
purpose do ye fast for me?" And by us He saith to you, "If ye fast unto
oaths and perjuries, to what purpose do ye fast? For how shall we behold
the sacred Passover? How shall we receive the holy Sacrifice? How shall
we be partakers of those wonderful mysteries by means of the same
tongue with which we have trampled upon God's law, the same tongue
with which we have contaminated the soul? For if no one would dare to
receive the royal purple with filthy hands, how shall we receive the Lord's
Body with a tongue that has become polluted! For the oath is of the
wicked one, but the Sacrifice is of the Lord. "What communion then hath
light with darkness, and what concord hath Christ with Belial?"

15. That ye are desirous, indeed, to be rid of this impiety, I know well; but
since each man may not be able easily to accomplish this by himself, let us
enter into fraternities and partnerships in this matter; and as the poor do in
their feasts, when each one alone would not be able to furnish a complete
banquet; when they all meet together, they each bring their contribution to
the feast; so also let us act. Inasmuch as we are of ourselves too listless, let
us make partnerships with each other, and pledge ourselves to contribute
counsel, and admonitions and exhortation, and rebuke and reminiscence,
and threatening; in order that from the diligence of each we may all be
amended. For seeing that we observe the affairs of our neighbor more
sharply than we do our own, let us be watchful of the safety of others,
and commit the guardianship of ourselves to them; and let us engage in this
pious rivalry, to the end that thus becoming superior to such an evil habit,
we may come with boldness to this holy feast; and be partakers of the
holy Sacrifice, with a favorable hope and a good conscience; through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with
whom, be glory to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.
Amen.

HOMILY 12

Thanksgiving to God for the pardon granted to the offenders
against the Emperor. Physical discourse on the Creation. Proof
that God, in creating man, implanted in him a natural law. Duty of
avoiding oaths with the utmost diligence.

1. YESTERDAY I said "Blessed be God!" and today again I say the very
same thing. For although the evils we dreaded have passed away, we
should not suffer the memory of them to disappear; not indeed that we
may grieve, but that we may give thanks. For if the memory of these
terrors abide with us, we shall never be overtaken by the actual experience
of such terrors. For what need have we of the experience, whilst our
memory acts the part of a monitor? Seeing then that God hath not
permitted us to be overwhelmed in the flood of those troubles when upon
us, let us not permit ourselves to become careless when these are passed
away. Then, when we were sad, He consoled us, let us give thanks to Him
now that we are joyful. In our agony He comforted us, and did not forsake
us; therefore let us not betray ourselves in prosperity by declining into
sloth. "Forget not," saith one, "the time of famine in the day of plenty."
Therefore let us be mindful of the time of temptation in the day of relief;
and with respect to our sins let us also act in the same manner. If thou hast
sinned, and God hath pardoned thy sin, receive thy pardon, and give
thanks; but be not forgetful of the sin; not that thou shouldest fret thyself
with the thought of it, but that thou mayest school thy soul, not to grow
wanton, and relapse again into the same snares.

2. Thus also Paul did; for having said, "He counted me faithful, putting me
into the ministry," he goes on to add, "who was before a blasphemer, a
persecutor, and injurious." "Let the life of the servant," saith he, "be
openly exposed, so that the lovingkindness of the Master be apparent. For
although I have received the remission of sins, I do not reject the memory
of those sins." And this not only manifested the lovingkindness of the
Lord, but made the man himself the more illustrious. For when thou hast
learnt who he was before, then thou wilt be the more astonished at him;
and when thou seest out of what he came to be what he was, then thou
wilt commend him the more; and if thou hast greatly sinned, yet upon

being changed thou wilt conceive favorable hopes from this instance. For
in addition to what has been said, such an example comforts those who are
in despair, and causes them again to stand erect. The same thing also will
be the case with regard to our city; for all the events that have happened
serve to shew your virtue, who by means of repentance have prevailed to
ward off such wrath, whilst at the same time they proclaim the
lovingkindness of God, who has removed the cloud that was so
threatening, in consequence of a small change of conduct, and so raises up
again all those who are sunk in despair, when they learn, from our case,
that he who looks upward for the Divine help, is not to be overwhelmed,
though innumerable waves should encompass him on all sides.

3. For who hath seen, who hath ever heard of sufferings such as were
ours? We were every day in expectation that our city would be overturned
from its foundations together with its inhabitants. But when the Devil was
hoping to sink the vessel, then God produced a perfect calm. Let us not
then be unmindful of the greatness of these terrors, in order that we may
remember the magnitude of the benefits received from God. He who
knows not the nature of the disease will not understand the physician's
art. Let us tell these things also to our children; and transmit them to the
remotest generations, that all may learn how the Devil had endeavored to
destroy the very foundation of the city; and how God was able visibly to
raise it up again, when it was fallen and prostrate; and did not permit even
the least injury to befall it, but took away the fear; and dispelled with
much speed the peril it had been placed in. For even through the past week
we were all expecting that our substance would be confiscated; and that
soldiers would have been let loose upon us; and we were dreaming of a
thousand other horrors. But Lo! all these things have passed away, even
like a cloud or a flitting shadow; and we have been punished only in the
expectation of what is dreadful; or rather we have not been punished, but
we have been disciplined, and have become better; God having softened
the heart of the Emperor. Let us then always and every day say, "Blessed
be God!" and with greater zeal let us give heed to our assembling, and let
us hasten to the church, from whence we have reaped this benefit. For ye
know whither ye fled at the first; whither ye flocked together; and from
what quarter our safety came. Let us then hold fast by this sacred anchor;
and as in the season of danger it did not betray us, so now let us not leave

it in the season of relief; but let us await with exact attention the stated
assemblies and prayers; and let us every day give a hearing to the divine
oracles. And the leisure which we spent in busily running about after those
who came from the court, whilst we were laboring under anxiety in respect
to the evils that threatened us; this let us consume wholly in hearing the
divine laws, instead of unseasonable and senseless pastimes; lest we
should again reduce ourselves to the necessity of that sort of occupation.

4. On the three foregoing days, then, we have investigated one method of
acquiring the knowledge of God, and have brought it to a conclusion;
explaining how "the heavens declare the glory of God;" and what the
meaning of that is, which is said by Paul; viz. "That the invisible things of
Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by
the things that are made." And we shewed how from the creation of the
world, and how by heaven, and earth, the sea, the Creator is glorified. But
today, after briefly philosophizing on that same subject, we will proceed
to another topic. For He not only made it, but provided also that when it
was made, it should carry on its operations; not permitting it to be all
immovable, nor commanding it to be all in a state of motion. The heaven,
for instance, hath remained immovable, according as the prophet says, "He
placed the heaven as a vault, and stretched it out as a tent over the earth."
But, on the other hand, the sun with the rest of the stars, runs on his
course through every day. And again, the earth is fixed, but the waters are
continually in motion; and not the waters only, but the clouds, and the
frequent and successive showers, which return at their proper season. The
nature of the clouds is one, but the things which are produced out of them
are different. For the rain, indeed, becomes wine in the grape, but oil in the
olive. And in other plants is changed into their juices; and the womb of the
earth is one, and yet bears different fruits. The heat, too, of the sun-beams
is one, but it ripens all things differently; bringing some to maturity more
slowly, and others more quickly. Who then but must feel astonishment
and admiration at these things?

5. Nay, this is not the only wonder, that He hath formed it with this great
variety and diversity; but farther, that He hath spread it before all in
common; the rich and the poor, sinners as well as the righteous. Even as
Christ also declared: "He maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the
good, and sendeth His rain upon the just and unjust." Moreover, when He

stocked the world with various animals, and implanted divers dispositions
in the creatures, He commanded us to imitate some of these, and to avoid
others. For example; the ant is industrious, and performs a laborious task.
By giving heed then, thou wilt receive the strongest admonition from this
animal not to indulge in sloth, nor to shun labor and toil. Therefore also the
Scripture has sent the sluggard to the ant, saying, "Go to the ant, thou
sluggard, emulate his ways, and be wiser than he." Art thou unwilling, he
means, to learn from the Scriptures, that it is good to labor, and that he
who will not work, neither ought he to eat? learn it from the irrationals!
This also we do in our families, when those who are older, and who are
considered superior, have done amiss, we bid them to attend to thoughtful
children. We say, "Mark such an one, who is less than you, how earnest
and watchful he is." Do thou then likewise receive from this animal the
best exhortation to industry; and marvel at thy Lord, not only because He
hath made heaven and the sun, but because He hath also made the ant. For
although the animal be small, it affords much proof of the greatness of
God's wisdom. Consider then how prudent the ant is, and consider how
God hath implanted in so small a body, such an unceasing desire of
working! But whilst from this animal thou learnest industry; take from the
bee at once a lesson of neatness, industry, and social concord! For it is not
more for herself than for us, that the bee labors, and toils every day; which
is indeed a thing especially proper for a Christian; not to seek his own
things, but the things of others. As then she traverses all the meadows that
she may prepare a banquet for another, so also, O man, do thou likewise;
and if thou hast accumulated wealth, expend it upon others; if thou hast
the faculty of teaching, do not bury the talent, but bring it out publicly for
the sake of those who need it! Or if thou hast any other advantage, become
useful to those who require the benefit of thy labors! Seest thou not that
for this reason, especially, the bee is more honored than the other animals;
not because she labors, but because she labors for others? For the spider
also labors, and toils, and spreads out his fine textures over the walls,
surpassing the utmost skill of woman; but the creature is without
estimation, since his work is in no way profitable to us; such are they that
labor and toil, but for themselves! Imitate too the simplicity of the dove!
Imitate the ass in his love to his master, and the ox also! Imitate the birds
in their freedom from anxiety! For great, great indeed is the advantage that
may be gained from irrational creatures for the correction of manners.

6. From these animals Christ also instructs us, when He says, "Be ye wise
as serpents, and harmless as doves." And again; "Behold the fowls of the
air, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
heavenly Father feedeth them." The prophet also, to shame the ungrateful
Jews, thus speaks; "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's
crib; but Israel doth not know me." And again; "The turtle and the
swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming, but my people
knoweth not the judgment of the Lord his God." From these animals, and
such as these, learn to achieve virtue, and be instructed to avoid
wickedness by the contrary ones. For as the bee followeth good, so the
asp is destructive. Therefore shun wickedness, lest thou hear it said, "The
poison of asps is under their lips." Again, the dog is devoid of shame.
Hate, therefore, this kind of wickedness. The fox also is crafty, and
fraudulent. Emulate not this vice; but as the bee, in flying over the
meadows, does not choose every sort of flower; but selecting that which is
useful, leaves the rest; so also do thou; and whilst surveying the whole
race of irrational animals, if any thing profitable may be drawn from these,
accept it; the advantages which they have naturally, make it thy business
to practice of thine own free choice. For in this respect also thou hast been
honored of God; that what they have as natural advantages He hath
permitted thee to achieve of thy own free choice, in order that thou
mayest also receive a reward. For good works with them spring not from
free will, and reason, but from nature only. In other words, the bee makes
honey, not because it has learnt this by reason and reflection, but because
it is instructed by nature. Because if the work had not been natural, and
allotted to the race, some of them assuredly would have been unskilled in
their art; whereas from the time that the world was first made, even to the
present day, no one hath observed bees resting from labor, and not making
honey. For such natural characteristics are common to the whole race. But
those things which depend on our free choice are not common; for labor is
necessary that they may be accomplished.

7. Take then all the best things, and clothe thyself with them; for thou art
indeed king of the irrationals; but kings, if there be any thing excellent
possessed by their subjects, be it gold or silver, or precious stones, or
sumptuous vestments, usually possess the same in greater abundance.
From the creation also, learn to admire thy Lord! And if any of the things

thou seest exceed thy comprehension, and thou art not able to find the
reason thereof, yet for this glorify the Creator, that the wisdom of these
works surpasses thine understanding. Say not, wherefore is this? or, to
what end? for everything is useful, even if we know not the reason of it.
As therefore, if thou goest into a surgery, and seest many instruments
lying before thee, thou wonderest at the variety of the implements though
ignorant of their use; so also act with respect to the creation. Although
thou seest many of the animals, and of the herbs, and plants, and other
things, of which thou knowest not the use, admire the variety of these; and
feel astonishment for this reason at the perfect workmanship of God; that
He hath neither made all things manifest to thee, nor permitted all things to
be unknown. For He hath not permitted all things to be unknown, lest
thou shouldest say, that the things that exist are not of providence. He
hath not permitted all things to be known to thee, lest the greatness of thy
knowledge should excite thee to pride. Thus at least it was that the evil
demon precipitated the first man headlong and by means of the hope of
greater knowledge, deprived him of that he already possessed. Therefore
also, a certain wise man exhorts, saying, "Seek not out the things that are
too hard for thee; neither search the things that are too deep for thee. But
what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; for the greater
part of His works are done in secret." And again; "More things are shewed
unto thee than men understand." But this he speaks for the purpose of
consoling the man who is sad and vexed, because he does not know all
things; for even those things he observes, which thou art permitted to
know, greatly surpass thine understanding; for thou couldest not have
found them by thyself, but thou hast been taught them of God. Wherefore
be content with the wealth given thee, and do not seek more; but for what
thou hast received give thanks; and do not be angry on account of those
things which thou hast not received. And, for what thou knowest, give
glory, and do not stumble at those things of which thou art ignorant. For
God hath made both alike profitably; and hath revealed some things, but
hidden others, providing for thy safety.

8. One mode, then, of knowing God, is that by the creation, which I have
spoken of, and which might occupy many days. For in order that we
might go over the formation of man only with exactness, (and I speak of
exactness such as is possible to us, not of real exactness; since many as are

the reasons we have already given for the works of creation, many more of
these there are, ineffable, which God who made them knoweth, for of
course we do not know them all); in order then, I say, that we might take
an exact survey of the whole modeling of man; and that we might discover
the skill there is in every member; and examine the distribution and
situation of the sinews, the veins, and the arteries, and the molding of
every other part; not even a whole year would suffice for such a
disquisition.

9. For this reason, here dismissing this subject; and having given to the
laborious and studious an opportunity, by what has been said, of going
over likewise the other parts of Creation; we shall now direct our
discourse to another point which is itself also demonstrative of God's
providence. What then is this second point? It is, that when God formed
man, he implanted within him from the beginning a natural law. And what
then was this natural law? He gave utterance to conscience within us; and
made the knowledge of good things, and of those which are the contrary,
to be self-taught. For we have no need to learn that fornication is an evil
thing, and that chastity is a good thing, but we know this from the first.
And that you may learn that we know this from the first, the Lawgiver,
when He afterwards gave laws, and said, "Thou shalt not kill," did not
add, "since murder is an evil thing," but simply said, "Thou shall not kill;"
for He merely prohibited the sin, without teaching. How was it then when
He said, "Thou shalt not kill," that He did not add, "because murder is a
wicked thing." The reason was, that conscience had taught this beforehand;
and He speaks thus, as to those who know and understand the point.
Wherefore when He speaks to us of another commandment, not known to
us by the dictate of consciences He not only prohibits, but adds the
reason. When, for instance, He gave commandment respecting the Sabbath;
"On the seventh day thou shalt do no work;" He subjoined also the reason
for this cessation. What was this? "Because on the seventh day God
rested from all His works which He had begun to make." And again;
"Because thou weft a servant in the land of Egypt." For what purpose
then I ask did He add a reason respecting the Sabbath, but did no such
thing in regard to murder? Because this commandment was not one of the
leading ones. It was not one of those which were accurately defined of our
conscience, but a kind of partial and temporary one; and for this reason it

was abolished afterwards. But those which are necessary and uphold our
life, are the following; "Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit
adultery; Thou shalt not steal." On this account then He adds no reason in
this case, nor enters into any instruction on the matter, but is content with
the bare prohibition.

10. And not only from thence, but from another consideration also, I will
endeavor to shew you how man was self-taught with respect to the
knowledge of virtue. Adam sinned the first sin; and after the sin
straightway hid himself; but if he had not known he had been doing
something wrong, why did he hide himself? For then there were neither
letters, nor law, nor Moses. Whence then doth he recognize the sin, and
hide himself? Yet not only does he so hide himself, but when called to
account, he endeavors to lay the blame on another, saying, "The woman,
whom Thou gavest me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat." And that
woman again transfers the accusation to another, viz. the serpent. Observe
also the wisdom of God; for when Adam said, "I heard Thy voice, and I
was afraid, for I was naked, and I hid myself," God does not at once
convict him of what he had done, nor say, "Why hast thou eaten of the
tree?" But how? "Who told thee," He asks, "that thou wast naked, unless
thou hast eaten of that Tree of which alone I commanded thee not to eat?"
He did not keep silence, nor did He openly convict him. He did not keep
silence, that He might call him forth to the confession of his crime. He did
not convict him openly, lest the whole might come from Himself, and the
man should so be deprived of that pardon which is granted us from
confession. Therefore he did not declare openly the cause from whence
this knowledge sprung, but he carried on the discourse in the form of
interrogation, leaving the man himself to come to the confession.

11. Again, in the case of Cain and Abel, the same proceeding is observable.
For, in the first place, they set apart the fruits of their own labors to God.
For we would shew not from his sin only, but also from his virtue, that
man was capable of knowing both these things. Wherefore that man knew
sin to be an evil thing, Adam manifested; and that he knew that virtue was
a good thing, Abel again made evident. For without having learnt it from
any one, without having heard any law promulgated respecting the first
fruits, but having been taught from within, and from his conscience, he
presented that sacrifice. On this account I do not carry the argument down

to a later period; but I bring it to bear upon the time of these earlier men,
when there were as yet no letters, as yet no law, nor as yet prophets and
judges; but Adam only existed with his children; in order that thou mayest
learn, that the knowledge of good and evil had been previously implanted
in their natures. For from whence did Abel learn that to offer sacrifice was
a good thing; that it was good to honor God, and in all things to give
thanks? "Why then?" replies some one, "did not Cain bring his offering?"
This man also did offer sacrifice, but not in like manner. And from thence
again the knowledge of conscience is apparent. For when, envying him
who had been honored, he deliberated upon murder, he conceals his crafty
determination. And what says he; "Come, let us go forth into the field."
The outward guise was one thing, the pretense of love; the thought
another, the purpose of fratricide. But if he had not known the design to
be a wicked one, why did he conceal it? And again, after the murder had
been perpetrated, being asked of God, "Where is Abel thy brother?" he
answers, "I know not; Am I my brother's keeper?" Wherefore does he
deny the crime? Is it not evidently because he exceedingly condemns
himself. For as his father had hid himself, so also this man denies his guilt,
and after his conviction, again says, "My crime is too great to obtain
pardon."

12. But it may be objected, that the Gentile allows nothing of this sort.
Come then, let us discuss this point, and as we have done with respect to
the creation, having carried on the warfare against these objectors not only
by the help of the Scriptures, but of reason, so also let us now do with
respect to conscience. For Paul too, when he was engaged in controversy
with such persons, entered upon this head. What then is it that they urge?
They say, that there is no self-evident law seated in our consciences; and
that God hath not implanted this in our nature. But if so, whence is it, I
ask, that legislators have written those laws which are among them
concerning marriages, concerning murders, concerning wills, concerning
trusts, concerning abstinence from encroachments on one another, and a
thousand other things. For the men now living may perchance have learned
them from their elders; and they from those who were before them, and
these again from those beyond? But from whom did those learn who were
the originators and first enactors of laws among them? Is it not evident
that it was from conscience? For they cannot say, that they held

communication with Moses; or that they heard the prophets. How could
it be so when they were Gentiles? But it is evident that from the very law
which God placed in man when He formed him from the beginning, laws
were laid down, and arts discovered, and all other things. For the arts too
were thus established, their originators having come to the knowledge of
them in a self-taught manner.

13. So also came there to be courts of justice, and so were penalties
defined, as Paul accordingly observes. For since many of the Gentiles were
ready to controvert this, and to say, "How will God judge mankind who
lived before Moses? He did not send a lawgiver; He did not introduce a
law; He commissioned no prophet, nor apostle, nor evangelist; how then
can He call these to account?" Since Paul therefore wished to prove that
they possessed a self taught law; and that they knew clearly what they
ought to do; hear how he speaks; "For when the Gentiles who have not
the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the
law, are a law unto themselves; which shew the work of the law written in
their hearts." But how without letters? "Their conscience also bearing
witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing, or else excusing one
another. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
Christ according to my gospel." And again; "As many as have sinned
without law, shall perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the
law, shall be judged by the law." What means, "They shall perish without
law?" The law not accusing them, but their thoughts, and their conscience;
for if they had not a law of conscience, it were not necessary that they
should perish through having done amiss. For how should it be so if they
sinned without a law? but when he says, "without a law," he does not
assert that they had no law, but that they had no written law, though they
had the law of nature. And again; "But glory, honor, and peace, to every
man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile."

14. But these things he spake in reference to the early times, before the
coming of Christ; and the Gentile he names here is not an idolater, but one
who worshipped God only; unfettered by the necessity of Judaical
observances, (I mean Sabbaths, and circumcision, and divers purifications,)
yet exhibiting all manner of wisdom and piety. And again, discoursing of
such a worshipper, he observes, "Wrath and indignation, tribulation and
anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also

of the Gentile." Again he here calls by the name of Greek one who was
free from the observance of Judaic customs. If, then, he had not heard the
law, nor conversed with the Jews, how could there be wrath, indignation
and tribulation against him for working evil? The reason is, that he
possessed a conscience inwardly admonishing him, and teaching him, and
instructing him in all things. Whence is this manifest? From the way in
which he punished others when they did amiss; from the way in which he
laid down laws; from the way in which he set up the tribunals of justice.
With the view of making this more plain, Paul spoke of those who were
living in wickedness. "Who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they
which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but
also consent with them that practice them." "But from whence," says
some one, "did they know, that it is the will of God, that those who live in
iniquity should be punished with death?" From whence? Why, from the
way in which they judged others who sinned. For if thou deemest not
murder to be a wicked thing, when thou hast gotten a murderer at thy bar,
thou shouldest not punish him. So if thou deemest it not an evil thing to
commit adultery, when the adulterer has fallen into thy hands, release him
from punishment! But if thou recordest laws, and prescribest
punishments, and art a severe judge of the sins of others; what defense
canst thou make, in matters wherein thou thyself doest amiss, by saying
that thou art ignorant what things ought to be done? For suppose that
thou and another person have alike been guilty of adultery. On what
account dost thou punish him, and deem thyself worthy of forgiveness?
Since if thou didst not know adultery to be wickedness, it were not right
to punish it in another. But if thou punishest, and thinkest to escape the
punishment thyself, how is it agreeable to reason that the same offenses
should not pay the same penalty?

15. This indeed is the very thing which Paul rebukes, when he says, "And
thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and
doest the same, that thou shall escape the judgment of God?" It is not, it
cannot be possible; for from the very sentence, he means, which thou
pronouncest upon another, from this sentence God will then judge thee.
For surely thou art not just, and God unjust! But if thou overlookest not
another suffering wrong, how shall God overlook? And if thou correctest
the sins of others, how will not God correct thee? And though He may not

bring the punishment upon thee instantly, be not confident on that
account, but fear the more. So also Paul bade thee, saying, "Despisest thou
the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and longsuffering, not
knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?" For
therefore, saith he, doth he bear with thee, not that thou mayest become
worse, but that thou mayest repent. But if thou wilt not, this longsuffering
becomes a cause of thy greater punishment; continuing, as thou dost,
impenitent. This, however, is the very thing he means, when he says, "But
after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up to thyself wrath
against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.
Who will render to every man according to his deeds." Since, therefore, He
rendereth to every man according to his works; for this reason He both
implanted within us a natural law, and afterwards gave us a written one, in
order that He might demand an account of sins, and that He might crown
those who act rightly. Let us then order our conduct with the utmost care,
and as those who have soon to encounter a fearful tribunal; knowing that
we shall enjoy no pardon, if after a natural as well as written law, and so
much teaching and continual admonition, we neglect our own salvation.

16. I desire then to address you again on the subject of oaths; but I feel
ashamed. For to me, indeed, it is not wearisome both by day and by night
to repeat the same things to you. But I am afraid, lest, having followed
you up so many days, I should seem to condemn you of great listlessness,
that you should require continual admonition respecting so easy a matter.
And I am not only ashamed, but also in fear for you! for frequent
instruction. to those who give heed, is salutary and profitable; but to those
who are listless, it is injurious, and exceedingly perilous; for the oftener
any one hears, the greater punishment does he draw upon him. self, if he
does not practice what is told him. With this accordingly God reproached
the Jews, speaking thus: "I have sent my prophets, rising up early, and
sending them; and even then ye did not hearken." We therefore do this of
our great care for you. But we fear, lest, on that tremendous Day, this
admonition and counsel should rise up against you all. For when the point
to be attained is easy, and he whose office it is continually to admonish,
desists not from his task, what defense shall we have to offer? or what
argument will save us from punishment? Tell me, if a sum of money
chance to be due to you, do you not always, when you meet the debtor,

remind him of the loan? Do thou too act thus; and let every one suppose
that his neighbor owes him money, viz., the fulfilling of this precept; and
upon meeting him, let him put him in mind of the payment, knowing that
no small danger lies at our door, whilst we are unmindful of our brethren.
For this cause I too cease not to make mention of these things. For I fear,
lest by any means I should hear it said on that day, "O wicked and
slothful servant, thou oughtest to have put my money to the exchangers."
Behold, however, I have laid it down, not once, or twice, but oftentimes. It
is left then for you to discharge the usury of it. Now the usury of hearing
is the manifestation of it by deeds, for the deposit is the Lord's. Therefore
let us not negligently receive that with which we are entrusted; but let us
keep it with diligence, that we may restore it with much interest on That
Day. For unless thou bring others to the performance of the same good
works, thou shalt hear that voice, which he who buried the talent heard.
But God forbid it should be this! but may you hear that different voice
which Christ uttered, saying to him who had made profit, "Well done,
good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
make thee ruler over many things."

17. And this voice we shall hear, if we shew the same earnestness as he
did. And we shall shew this earnestness, if we do this which I say. When
you depart, whilst what you have heard is yet warm within you, exhort
one another! And just as ye each salute at parting, so let every one go from
hence with an admonition, and say to his neighbor, "Observe and
remember that thou keep the commandment;" and thus shall we assuredly
get the mastery. For when friends also dismiss one with such counsel; and
on one's return home, one's wife again admonishes one to the same effect;
and our word keeps its hold on you when alone; we shall soon shake off
this evil habit. I know, indeed, that ye marvel why I am so earnest
respecting this precept. But discharge the duty enjoined, and then I will
tell you. Meanwhile, this I say; that this precept is a divine law; and it is
not safe to transgress it. But if I shall see it rightly performed, I will speak
of another reason? which is not less than this, that ye may learn that it is
with justice I make so much ado about this law. But it is now time to
conclude this address in a prayer. Wherefore, let us all say in common, "O
God, Who willest not the death of a sinner, but that he should be
converted and live; grant that we, having discharged this and every other

precept, may be found worthy so to stand at the tribunal of Thy Christ,
that having enjoyed great boldness, we may attain the kingdom to Thy
glory. For to Thee belongeth glory, together with Thine only begotten Son,
and the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and world without end." Amen.

HOMILY 13

A further thanksgiving to God for the change in the late melancholy
aspect of affairs. Reminiscence of those who were dragged away,
and punished because of the sedition. Exposition on the subject of
the creation of man, and of his having received a natural law. Of
the complete accomplishment of abstinence from oaths.

1. WITH the same introduction and prelude that I began yesterday and the
day before, I shall begin today. Now again I will say, "Blessed be God!"
What a day did we see last Wednesday! and what in the present! On that
day how heavy was the gloom! How bright the calm of the present! That
was the day when that fearful tribunal was set in the city, and shook the
hearts of all, and made the day to seem no better than night; not because
the beams of the sun were extinguished. but because that despondency and
fear darkened your eyes. Wherefore, that we may reap the more pleasure, I
wish to relate a few of the circumstances which then occurred; for I
perceive that a narrative of these things will be serviceable to you, and to
all who shall come afterwards. Besides, to those who have been delivered
from shipwreck, it is sweet to remember the waves, and the tempest, and
the winds, when they are come into port. And to those who have fallen
into sickness, it is an agreeable thing, when the sickness is over, to talk
over with others the fevers by which they were nearly brought to the
grave. When terrors have passed away, there is a pleasure in relating those
terrors; the soul no longer fearing them, but deriving therefrom more
cheerfulness. The remembrance of past evils always makes the present
prosperity to appear more strikingly.

2. When the greater portion of the city had taken refuge from the fear and
danger of that occasion, in secret places, in deserts, and in hollows; terror
besetting them in all directions; and the houses were empty of women, and
the forum of men, and scarce two or three appeared walking together
across it, and even these going about as if they had been animated corpses:
at this period, I proceeded to the tribunal of justice, for the purpose of
seeing the end of these transactions; and there, beholding the fragments of
the city collected together, I marveled most of all at this, that although a
multitude was around the doors, there was the profoundest silence, as

though there had been no man there, all looking upon one another; not one
daring to enquire of his neighbor, nor to hear anything from him; for each
regarded his neighbor with suspicion; since many already, having been
dragged away, beyond all expectation, from the midst of the forum, were
now confined within. Thus we all alike looked up to heaven, and stretched
out our hands in silence, expecting help from above, and beseeching God to
stand by those who were brought to judgment, to soften the hearts of the
judges, and to make their sentence a merciful one. And just as when some
persons on land, beholding others suffering shipwreck, cannot indeed go
near to them, and reach out the hand, and relieve their distress, being kept
back from them by the waves; yet away on the shore, with outstretched
hands and tears, they supplicate God that He may help the drowning; so
there in like manner, did all silently and mentally call upon God, pleading
for those at the tribunal, as for men surrounded by the waves, that He
would stretch out His hand, and not suffer the vessel to be overwhelmed,
nor the judgment of those under trial to end in an utter wreck. Such was
the state of things in front of the doors; but when I entered within the
court, other sights I saw which were still more awful; soldiers armed with
swords and clubs, and strictly keeping the peace for the judges within. For
since all the relatives of those under trial, whether wives, or mothers, or
daughters, or fathers, stood before the doors of the seat of justice; in order
that if any one happened to be led away to execution, yet no one inflamed
at the sight of the calamity might raise any tumult or disturbance; the
soldiers drove them all afar off; thus preoccupying their mind with fear.

3. One sight there was, more pitiable than all; a mother, and a sister of a
certain person, who was among those under trial within, sat at the very
vestibule of the court of justice, rolling themselves on the pavement, and
becoming a common spectacle to all the bystanders; veiling their faces, and
shewing no sense of shame, but that which the urgency of the calamity
permitted. No maid servant, nor neighbor, nor female friend, nor any other
relative accompanied them. But hemmed in by a crowd of soldiers, alone,
and meanly clad, and groveling on the ground, about the very doors, they
were in more pitiable case than those who were undergoing judgment
within, and hearing as they did the voice of the executioners, the strokes of
the scourge, the wailing of those who were being scourged, the fearful
threats of the judges, they themselves endured, at every scourging, sharper

pains than those who were beaten. For since, in the confessions of others,
there was a danger of accusations being proved, if they heard any one
scourged that he might mention those who were guilty, and uttering cries,
they, looking up to heaven, besought God to give the sufferer some
strength of endurance, test the safety of their own relations should be
betrayed by the weakness of others, while incapable of sustaining the
sharp anguish of the strokes. And again, the same thing occurred as in the
case of men who are struggling with a tempest. For just as when they
perceive the violence of a wave lifting up its head from afar, and gradually
increasing, and ready to overwhelm the vessel, they are almost dead with
terror, before it comes near the ship; so also was it with these. If at any
time they heard voices, and cries that reached them, they saw a thousand
deaths before their eyes, being in terror, lest those who were urged to bear
witness, giving way to their torments, should name some one of those who
were their own relatives. And thus, one saw tortures both within and
without. Those within the executioners were tormenting; these women, the
despotic force of nature, and the sympathy of the affections. There was
lamentation within, and without! inside, on the part of those who were
found guilty, and outside on the part of their relatives. Yea, rather not
these only, but their very judges inwardly lamented, and suffered more
severely than all the rest; being compelled to take part in so bitter a
tragedy.

4. As for me, while I sat and beheld all this, how matrons and virgins,
wont to live in seclusion, were now made a common spectacle to all; and
how those who were accustomed to lie on a soft couch, had now the
pavement for their bed; and how they who had enjoyed so constant an
attendance of female servants and eunuchs, and every sort of outward
distinction, were now bereft of all these things; and groveling at the feet of
every one, beseeching him to lend help by any means in his power to
those who were undergoing examination, and that there might be a kind of
general contribution of mercy from all; I exclaimed, in those words of
Solomon, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." For I saw both this and
another oracle fulfilled in every deed, which saith, "All the glory of man is
as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth away."
For then indeed, wealth, and nobility, and notoriety, and the patronage of
friends, and kinship and all worldly things, were found worthless; the sin,

and transgression of the law which had taken place, having put all these
succors to flight. And just as the mother of young birds, when the
nestlings have been carried away, coming and finding her nest empty, is
unable to rescue her captive brood; but by hovering around the hands of
the fowler, in this way displays her grief; even so did these women then
do, when their children were snatched away from their dwellings, and shut
up within, as it were in a net, or a trap. They could not indeed come in and
deliver the prisoners, but they manifested their anguish by wallowing on
the ground near the very doors; by lamentation and groans; and by
endeavoring to approach as near as possible to those who had captured
them. These things then beholding, I cast in my mind That Dread Tribunal;
and I said within myself, "If now, when men are the judges, neither
mother, nor sister, nor father, nor any other person, though guiltless of the
deeds which have been perpetrated, can avail to rescue the criminals; who
will stand by us when we are judged at the dread Tribunal of Christ? Who
will dare to raise his voice? Who will be able to rescue those who shall be
led away to those unbearable punishments. Notwithstanding they were
the first men of the city who were then brought to trial, and the very chief
of the nobility, yet they would have been glad if it could be granted them
to lose all their possessions, yea, if need were, their liberty itself, so that
they might continue to enjoy this present life.

5. But to proceed. The day now hastening to its close, and late evening
arriving, and the final sentence of the court being expected, all were in still
greater agony, and besought God that He would grant some delay and
respite; and incline the soul of the judges to refer the facts that had been
investigated to the decision of the Emperor; since perchance some
advantage might arise from this reference? Moreover, by the people
general supplications were sent up to the Merciful God; imploring that He
would save the remnants of the city; and not suffer it entirely to be razed
from its foundations. Nor could one see any one joining in this cry but
with tears. Nevertheless, none of these things then moved the judges
within, although they heard. One thing only they considered, that there
might be a rigid enquiry into the deeds that had been perpetrated.

6. At last having loaded the culprits with chains, and bound them with
iron, they sent them away to the prison through the midst of the forum.
Men that had kept their studs of horses, who had been presidents of the

games, who could reckon up a thousand different offices of distinction
which they had held, had their goods confiscated, and seals might be seen
placed upon all their doors. Their wives also being ejected from their
parents' home, each had literally to play the part of Job's wife. For they
went "wandering from house to house and from place to place, seeking a
lodging." And this it was not easy for them to find, every one fearing and
trembling to receive, or to render assistance in any way to the relatives of
those who were under impeachment. Nevertheless, though such events had
happened, the sufferers were patient under all; since they were not
deprived of the present life. And neither the loss of wealth, nor dishonor,
nor so much public exposure, nor any other matter of that nature, caused
them vexation. For the greatness of the calamity, and the circumstance of
their having expected still worse things, when they suffered these, had
prepared the soul for the exercise of a wise fortitude. And now they learnt,
how simple a thing is virtue for us, how easy and expeditious of
performance, and that from our neglect only it seems to be laborious. They
who before this time could not bear the loss of a little money with
meekness, now they were subject to a greater fear, although they had lost
all their substance, felt as if they had found a treasure, because they had
not lost their lives. So that if the sense of a future hell took possession of
us, and we thought of those intolerable punishments, we should not grieve,
even though for the sake of the law of God we were to give both our
substance, and our bodies and lives too, knowing that we should gain
greater things; deliverance from the terrors that are hereafter.

7. Perchance the tragedy of all I have told you, has greatly softened your
hearts. Do not however take it amiss. For since I am about to venture
upon some more subtle thoughts and require a more sensitive state of mind
on your part, I have done this intentionally, in order that by the terror of
the description your minds might have shaken off all listlessness, and
withdrawn themselves from all worldly cares, and might with the more
readiness convey the force of the things about to be spoken into the
depths of your soul.

Sufficiently indeed, then, our discourse of late evinced to you, that a
natural law of good and evil is seated within us. But that our proof of it
may be more abundantly evident, we will again today apply ourselves
strenuously to the same subject of discourse. For that God from the

beginning, when He formed man, made him capable of discriminating both
these, all men make evident. Hence when we sin, we are all ashamed at the
presence of our inferiors; and oftentimes a master, on his way to the house
of a harlot, if he then perceives any one of his more respectable servants,
turns back, reddening with shame, from this untoward path. Again, when
others reproach us, fixing on us the names of particular vices, we call it an
insult; and if we are aggrieved, we drag those who have done the wrong to
the public tribunal. Thus we can understand what vice is and what virtue
is. Wherefore Christ, for the purpose of declaring this, and shewing that
He was not introducing a strange law, or one which surpassed our nature,
but that which He had of old deposited beforehand in our conscience, after
pronouncing those numerous Beatitudes, thus speaks; "All things
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
"Many words," saith He, "are not necessary, nor laws of great length, nor
a diversity of instruction. Let thine own will be the law. Dost thou wish to
receive kindness? Be kind to another. Dost thou wish to receive mercy?
Show mercy to thy neighbor. Dost thou wish to be applauded? Applaud
another. Dost thou wish to be beloved? Exercise love. Dost thou wish to
enjoy the first rank? First concede that place to another. Become thyself
the judge, thyself the lawgiver of thine own life. And again; "Do not to
another what thou hatest." By the latter precept, he would induce to a
departure from iniquity; by the former, to the exercise of virtue. "Do not
thou to another," he saith, "what thou hatest." Dost thou hate to be
insulted? Do not insult another. Dost thou hate to be envied? Envy not
another. Dost thou hate to be deceived? Do not deceive another. And, in a
word, in all things, if we hold fast these two precepts, we shall not need
any other instruction. For the knowledge of virtue He hath implanted in
our nature; but the practice of it and the correction He hath entrusted to
our moral choice.

8. Perhaps what is thus said, is obscure; wherefore I will again endeavor to
make it more plain. In order to know that it is a good thing to exercise
temperance, we need no words, nor instruction; for we ourselves have the
knowledge of it in our nature, and there is no necessity for labor or fatigue
in going about and enquiring whether temperance is good and profitable;
but we all acknowledge this with one consent, and no man is in doubt as to
this virtue. So also we account adultery to be an evil thing, and neither is

there here any need of trouble or learning, that the wickedness of this sin
may be known; but we are all self-taught in such judgments; and we
applaud virtue, though we do not follow it; as, on the other hand, we hate
vice, though we practice it. And this hath been an exceeding good work of
God; that He hath made our conscience, and our power of choice already,
and before the action, claim kindred with virtue, and be at enmity with
wickedness.

9. As I said then, the knowledge of each of these things resides within the
conscience of all men, and we require no teacher to instruct us in these
things; but the regulation of our conduct is left to our choice, and
earnestness, and efforts. And why was this? but because if He had made
everything to be of nature, we should have departed uncrowned and
destitute of reward; and even as the brutes, who receive no reward nor
praise for those advantages which they have naturally, so neither should
we enjoy any of these things; for natural advantages are not the praise and
commendation of those who have them, but of the Giver. For this reason,
then, He did not commit all to nature; and again, He did not suffer our will
to undertake the whole burden of knowledge, and of right regulation; test it
should despair at the labor of virtue. But conscience suggests to it what
ought to be done; and it contributes its own exertions for the
accomplishment. That it is a good thing to be temperate, we all understand
without difficulty; for the knowledge is of nature: but we should not be
able without difficulty, without bridling lust, and employing much
exertion, to practice the rule of temperance; for this does not come to us
by nature as the knowledge does, but requires also a willing mind and
earnestness. And not only in this respect has He made the burden lighter
for us, but also in another way again, by letting even some good
dispositions exist naturally within us. For we are all naturally disposed to
feel indignation along with those who are contemptuously treated,
(whence it arises that we become the enemies of those who are insolent,
though we ourselves may have suffered no part of the grievance,) and to
sympathize in the pleasure of those who enjoy assistance and protection;
and we are overcome by the calamities of others, as well as by mutual
tenderness. For although calamitous events may seem to induce a certain
pusillanimity, we entertain nevertheless a common fondness for each

other. And to this effect a certain wise man speaks significantly; "Every
animal loveth his like, and man his neighbor."

10. But God hath provided many other instructors for us besides
conscience; viz., fathers for children, masters for servants, husbands for
wives, teachers for pupils, law-givers and judges for those who are to be
governed, and friends for friends. And frequently too we gain no less from
enemies than friends; for when the former reproach us with our offenses,
they stir us up, even against our will, to the amendment of them. So many
teachers hath He set over us, in order that the discovery of what is
profitable, and the regulation of our conduct, might be easy to us, the
multitude of those things which urge us on toward it not permitting us to
fall away from what is expedient for us. For although we should despise
parents, yet while we fear magistrates, we shall in any case be more
submissive than otherwise. And though we may set them at nought when
we sin, we can never escape the rebuke of conscience: and if we dishonor
and repel this, yet whilst fearing the opinion of the many, we shall be the
better for it. And though we are destitute of shame with regard to this, the
fear of the laws will press on us so as to restrain us, however reluctantly.

11. Thus fathers and teachers take the young in hand, and bring them into
order; and lawgivers and magistrates, those who are grown up. And
servants, as being more inclined to listlessness, in addition to what has
been previously mentioned, have their masters to constrain them to
temperance; and wives have their husbands. And many are the walls which
environs our race on all sides, lest it should too easily slide away, and fall
into wickedness. Beside all these too; sicknesses and calamities instruct us.
For poverty restrains, and losses sober us, and danger subdues us, and
there are many other things of this sort. Doth neither father, nor teacher,
nor prince, nor lawgiver, nor judge make thee fear? Doth no friend move
thee to shame, nor enemy sting thee? Doth no master chastise? Doth no
husband instruct? Doth no conscience correct thee? Still, when bodily
sickness comes, it often sets all right; and a loss has made the audacious
man to become gentle. And what is more than this, heavy misfortunes,
which befall not only ourselves but others too, are often of great advantage
to us; and we who ourselves suffered nothing, yet beholding others
enduring punishment, have been no less sobered by it than they.

12. And with respect to right deeds, any one may see that this happens;
for as when the bad are punished others become better, so whenever the
good achieve any thing right, many are urged onward to a similar zeal: a
thing which hath also taken place with respect to the avoiding of oaths.
For many persons, observing that others had laid aside the evil practice of
oaths, took a pattern from their diligence, and got the better of the sin;
wherefore we are the more disposed to touch again on the subject of this
admonition. For let no one tell me that "many" have accomplished this;
this is not what is desired, but that "all" should do so; and until I see this I
cannot take breath. That Shepherd had a hundred sheep, and vet when one
of them had wandered away, he took no account of the safety of the
ninety and nine, until he found the one that was lost, and restored it again
to the flock. Seest thou not that this also happens with respect to the
body; for if by striking against any obstacle, we have only turned back a
nail, the whole body sympathizes with the member. Say not this; that
only a certain few have failed; but consider this point, that these few being
unreformed, will corrupt many others. Although there was but one who
had committed fornication among the Corinthians, yet Paul so groaned as
if the whole city were lost. And very reasonably, for he knew that if that
member were not chastened, the disease progressing onward would at
length attack all the rest. I saw, but lately, in the court of justice, those
distinguished men bound and conducted through the forum; and while
some were wondering at this extraordinary degradation, others said there
was nothing to wonder at; for that, where there is matter of treason, rank
must go for nothing. Is it not then much more true that rank must be of no
avail where is impiety?

13. Thinking therefore of these things, let us arouse ourselves; for if ye
bring not your own endeavors to the task, every thing on our part is to no
purpose. And why so? Because it is not with the office of teaching, as it is
with other arts. For the silversmith, when he has fabricated a vessel of any
kind, and laid it aside, will find it on the morrow just as he left it. And the
worker in brass, and the stone-cutter, and every other artificer, will each
again take his own work in hand, whatever it is, just in the state he quitted
it. But it is not so with us, but altogether the reverse; for we have not
lifeless vessels to forge, but reasonable souls. Therefore we do not find
you such as we leave you, but when we have taken you, and with

manifold labor molded, reformed you and increased your ardor on your
departing from this place, the urgency of business, besetting you on every
side, again perverts you, and causes us increased difficulty. Therefore, I
supplicate and beseech you to put your own hand to the work; and when
ye depart hence, to shew the same earnest regard for your own safety, that
I have here shewn for your amendment.

14. Oh! that it were possible that I could perform good works as your
substitute, and that you could receive the rewards of those works! Then I
would not give you so much trouble. But how can I do this? The thing is
impossible; for to every man will He render according to his own works.
Wherefore as a mother, when she beholds her son in a fever, while she
witnesses his sufferings from choking and inflammation, frequently
bewails him, and says to him, "O my son, would that I could sustain thy
fever, and draw off its flame upon myself!" so now I say, Oh! that by
laboring as your substitute, I could do good works for you all! But no, this
is not to be done. But of his own doings must each man give the account,
and one cannot see one person suffer punishment in the room of another.
For this reason I am pained and mourn, that on That Day, when ye are
called to judgment, I shall not be able to assist you, since, to say the truth,
no such confidence of speech with God belongs to me. But even if I had
much confidence, I am not holier than Moses, or more righteous than
Samuel; of whom it is said, that though they had attained to so great
virtue, they could not in any way avail to assist the Jews; inasmuch as
that people had given themselves over to excessive negligence. Since, then,
from our own works we shall be punished or saved; let us endeavor, I
beseech you, in conjunction with all the other precepts, to fulfill this one;
that, finally departing this life with a favorable hope, we may obtain those
good things which are promised, through the grace and lovingkindness of
our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom and with Whom, to the Father, with
the Holy Ghost, be glory both now and ever, world without end. Amen.

HOMILY 14

After the whole people had been freed from all distress, and had
become assured of safety, certain persons again disturbed the city
by fabricating false reports, and were convicted. Wherefore this
Homily refers to that subject; and also to the admonition
concerning oaths; for which reason also, the history of Jonathan,
and Saul, and that of Jephthah, is brought forward; and it is shewn
how many perjuries result from one oath.

1. NOT a little did the devil yesterday disturb our city; but God also hath
not a little comforted us again; so that each one of us may seasonably take
up that prophetic saying, "In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in
my heart, thy comforts have refreshed my soul." And not only in
consoling, but Even in permitting us to be troubled, God hath manifested
His tender care towards us. For today I shall repeat what I have never
ceased to say, that not only our deliverance from evils, but also the
permission of them arises from the benevolence of God. For when He sees
us falling away into listlessness, and starting off from communion with
Him, and making no account of spiritual things, He leaves us for a while;
that thus brought to soberness, we may return to Him the more earnestly.
And what marvel is it, if He does this towards us, listless as we are; since
even Paul declares that with regard to himself and his disciples, this was
the cause of their trials? For inditing his second Epistle to the Corinthians,
he speaks thus: "We would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble
which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above
strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life; but we had the sentence
of death in ourselves." As though he would say, "Dangers so great hung
over us, that we gave up ourselves for lost; and no longer hoped that any
favorable change would take place, but were altogether in expectation of
death." For such is the sense of that clause, "We had the sentence of death
in ourselves." But nevertheless, after such a state of desperation, God
dispelled the tempest, and removed the cloud, and snatched us from the
very gates of death. And afterwards, for the purpose of shewing that his
being permitted to fall into this danger also was the result of much tender
care for him, he mentions the advantage which resulted from the

temptations. which was, that he might continually look to Him, and be
neither high-minded, nor confident. Therefore having said this, "We had
the sentence of death in ourselves;" he adds also the reason; "That we
should not trust in ourselves, but in God which quickeneth the dead." For
it is in the nature of trials to arouse us when we are dozing, or falling
down, and to stir us up, and make us more religious. When, therefore, O
beloved! thou seest a trial at one time extinguished, and at another time
kindled again, be not cast down! Do not despond, but retain a favorable
hope, reasoning thus with thyself, that God does not deliver us into the
hands of our enemies either because He hates or abandons us, but because
He is desirous to make us more in earnest, and more intimate with
Himself.

2. Let us not then be desponding; nor let us despair of a change for the
better; but let us hope that speedily there will be a calm; and, in short,
casting the issue of all the tumults which beset us upon God, let us again
handle the customary points; and again bring forward our usual topic of
instruction. For I am desirous to discourse to you further concerning the
same subject, to the end that we may radically extirpate from your souls
the wicked practice of oaths. Wherefore it is necessary for me again to
have recourse to the same entreaty that I made before. For lately I
besought you, that each one taking the head of John, just cut off, and the
warm blood yet dripping from it, you would thus go home, and think that
you saw it before your eyes, while it emitted a voice, and said, "Abhor my
murderer, the oath!" What a rebuke did not effect, this an oath effected
what a tyrant's wrath was insufficient for, this the necessity of keeping an
oath brought about! And when the tyrant was publicly rebuked in the
hearing of all, he bore the censure nobly; but when he had thrown himself
into the fatal necessity caused by oaths, then he cut off that blessed head.
This same thing, therefore, I entreat; and cease not entreating, that
wherever we go, we go bearing this head; and that we shew it to all, crying
aloud, as it does, and denouncing oaths. For although we were never so
listless and remiss, yet beholding the eyes of that head fearfully glaring
upon us, and threatening us if we swear, we should be more powerfully
kept in check by this terror, than by any curb; and be easily able to
restrain and avert the tongue from its inclination toward oaths.

3. There is not only this great evil in an oath, that it punishes those who
are guilty of it, both when violated, and when kept; a thing we do not see
take place with any other sin; but there is another equally great evil
attending it. And what is that? Why that ofttimes it is utterly impossible
even for those who are desirous, and even make a point of it, to keep their
oath. For, in the first place, he who is continually swearing, whether
willingly or unwillingly; knowingly or unknowingly; in jest or in earnest;
being frequently carried away by anger and by many other things, will
most surely become perjured. And no one can gainsay this; so evident and
generally allowed is the fact, that the man who swears frequently, must
also be a perjurer. Secondly, I affirm, that although he were not carried
away by passion, and did not become the victim of perjury unwillingly
and unwittingly, yet by the very nature of the case he will assuredly be
necessitated both consciously and voluntarily to perjure himself. Thus,
oftentimes when we are dining at home, and one of the servants happens
to do amiss, the wife swears that he shall be flogged, and then the husband
swears the contrary, resisting, and not permitting it. In this case, whatever
they may do, perjury must in any case be the result; for however much
they may wish and endeavor to keep their oaths, it is no longer possible;
but whatever happens, one or other of these will be ensnared in perjury; or
rather both in any case.

4. And how, I will explain; for this is the paradox. He who hath sworn that
he would flog the man-servant or maid-servant, yet hath afterwards been
prohibited from this, hath perjured himself, not having done what he hath
sworn to do: and also, he hath involved in the crime of perjury the party
forbidding and hindering the oath from being kept. For not only they who
take a false oath, but they who impose that necessity on others, are liable
to the same accusation. And not merely in houses, but also in the forum
we may see that this takes place; and especially in fights, when those who
box with one another swear things that are contrary. One swears that he
will beat, the other that he will not be beaten. One swears that he will
carry off the cloak, the other that he will not suffer this. One that he will
exact the money, the other that he will not pay it. And many other such
contradictory things, those who are contentious take an oath to do. So also
in shops, and in schools, it may generally be observed that the same thing
occurs. Thus the workman hath often sworn that he will not suffer his

apprentice to eat or drink, before he has finished all his assigned task. And
so also the pedagogue has often acted towards a youth; and a mistress
towards her maid-servant; and when the evening hath overtaken them, and
the work hath remained unfinished, it is necessary either that those who
have not executed their task should perish with hunger, or that those who
have sworn should altogether forswear themselves. For that malignant
demon, who is always lying in wait against our blessings, being present
and hearing the obligation of the oaths, impels those who are answerable to
indifference; or works some other difficulty; so that the task being
unperformed, blows, insults, and perjuries, and a thousand other evils,
may take place. And just as when children drag with all their might a long
and rotten cord in directions opposite to each other; if the cord snaps in
the middle, they all fall flat upon their backs, and some strike their heads,
and some another part of the body; so also they who each engage with an
oath to perform things that are contrary, when the oath is broken by the
necessity of the case, both parties fall into the same gulf of perjury: these
by actually perjuring themselves, and those by affording the occasion of
perjury to. the others.

5. That this also may be rendered evident, not only from what happens
every day in private houses, and the places of public concourse, but from
the Scriptures themselves, I will relate to you a piece of ancient history,
which bears upon what has been said. Once, when the Jews had been
invaded by their enemies, and Jonathan (now he was the son of Saul) had
slaughtered some, and put the rest to flight; Saul, his lather, being desirous
to rouse the army more effectually against the remainder; and in order that
they might not desist until he had subjugated them all, did that which was
altogether opposite to what he desired, by swearing that no one should eat
any food until evening, and until vengeance was taken of his enemies.
What, I ask, could have been more senseless than this? For when it was
needful that he should have refreshed those who were fatigued and
exhausted, and have sent them forth with renewed vigor against their
enemies, he treated them far worse than he had done their enemies, by the
constraint of an oath, which delivered them over to excessive hunger.
Dangerous, indeed, it is for any one to swear in a matter pertaining to
himself; for we are forcibly impelled to do many things by the urgency of
circumstances. But much more dangerous is it by the obligation of one's

own oath, to bind the determination of others; and especially where any
one swears, not concerning one, or two, or three, but an unlimited
multitude, which Saul then inconsiderately did, without thinking that it
was probable that, in so vast a number, one at least might transgress the
oath; or that soldiers, and soldiers too on campaign, are very far removed
from moral wisdom, and know nothing of ruling the belly; more especially
when their fatigue is great. He, however, overlooking all these points, as if
he were merely taking an oath about a single servant, whom he was easily
able to restrain, counted equally on his whole army. In consequence of this
he opened such a door for the devil, that in a short time he framed, not
two, three, or four, but many more perjuries out of this oath. For as when
we do not swear at all, we close the whole entrance against him, so if we
utter but a single oath, we afford him great liberty for constructing endless
perjuries. And just as those who twist skeins, if they have one to hold the
end, work the whole string with nicety, but if there is no one to do this,
cannot even undertake the commencement of it; in the same manner too
the devil, when about to twist the skein of our sins, if he could not get the
beginning from our tongues, would not be able to undertake the work; but
should we only make a commencement, while we hold the oath on our
tongue, as it were a hand, then with full liberty he manifests his malignant
art in the rest of the work, constructing and weaving from a single oath a
thousand perjuries.

6. And this was just what he did now in the case of Saul. Observe,
however, what a snare is immediately framed for this oath: "The army
passed through a wood, that contained a nest of bees, and the nest was in
front of the people, and the people came upon the nest, and went along
talking." Seest thou what a pit-fall was here? A table ready spread, that
the easiness of access, the sweetness of the food, and the hope of
concealment, might entice them to a transgression of the oath. For hunger
at once, and fatigue, and the hour, (for "all the lands" it is said, "was
dining)," then urged them to the transgression. Moreover, the sight of the
combs invited them from without to relax the strain on their resolution.
For the sweetness, as well as the present readiness of the table, and the
difficulty of detecting the stealth, were sufficient to ensnare their utmost
wisdom. If it had been flesh, which needed boiling or roasting, their minds
would not have been so much bewitched; since while they were delaying in

the cookery of these, and engaged in preparing them for food, they might
expect to be discovered. But now there was nothing of this kind; there was
honey only, for which no such labor was required, and for which the
dipping of the tip of the finger sufficed to partake of the table, and that
with secrecy. Nevertheless, these persons restrained their appetite, and
did not say within themselves, "What does it concern us? Hath any one of
us sworn this? He may pay the penalty of his inconsiderate oath, for why
did he swear?" Nothing of this sort did they think; but religiously passed
on; and though there were so many enticements, they behaved themselves
wisely. "The people went on talking." "What is the meaning of this word
"talking?" Why, that for the purpose of soothing their pain with words,
they held discourse with one another.

7. What then, did nothing more come of this, when all the people had acted
so wisely? Was the oath, forsooth, observed? Not even so was it
observed. On the contrary, it was violated! How, and in what way? Ye
shall hear forthwith, in order that ye may also thoroughly discern the
whole art of the devil. For Jonathan, not having heard his father take the
oath, "put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in
the honeycomb, and his eyes saw clearly." Observe, who it was whom he
impelled to break the oath; not one of the soldiers, but the very son of him
who had sworn it. For he did not only desire to effect perjury, but was
also plotting the slaughter of a son, and making provision for it
beforehand; and was in haste to divide nature against her own self. and
what he had done aforetime in the case of Jephthah, that he hoped now
again to accomplish. For he likewise, when he had promised that the first
thing that met him, after a victorious battle. he would sacrifice, fell into the
snare of child-murder; for his daughter first meeting him, he sacrificed her
and God did not forbid it. And I know, indeed, that many of the
unbelievers impugn us of cruelty and inhumanity on account of this
sacrifice; but I should say, that the concession in the case of this sacrifice
was a striking example of providence and clemency; and that it was in care
for our race that He did not prevent that sacrifice. For if after that vow and
promise He had forbidden the sacrifice, many also who were subsequent
to Jephthah, in the expectation that God would not receive their vows,
would have increased the number of such vows, and proceeding on their
way would have fallen into child-murder. But now, by suffering this vow

to be actually fulfilled, He put a stop to all such cases in future. And to
shew that this is true, after Jephthah's daughter had been slain, in order
that the calamity might be always remembered, and that her fate might not
be consigned to oblivion, it became a law among the Jews, that the virgins
assembling at the same season should bewail during forty days the
sacrifice which had taken place; in order that renewing the memory of it by
lamentation, they should make all men wiser for the future; and that they
might learn that it was not after the mind of God that this should be done,
for in that case He would not have permitted the virgins to bewail and
lament her. And that what I have said is not conjectural, the event
demonstrated; for after this sacrifice, no one vowed such a vow unto God.
Therefore also He did not indeed forbid this; but what He had expressly
enjoined in the case of Isaac, that He directly prohibited; plainly shewing
through both cases, that He doth not delight in such sacrifices.

8. But the malignant demon was laboring hard now again to produce such a
tragedy. Therefore he impelled Jonathan to the trespass. For if any one of
the soldiers had transgressed the law, it seemed to him no great evil that
would have been done; but now being insatiate of human ills, and never
able to get his fill of our calamities, he thought it would be no grand exploit
if he effected only a simple murder. And if he could not also pollute the
king's right hand with the murder of his child, he considered that he had
achieved no great matter. And why do I speak of child-murder? For he, the
wicked one, thought that by this means he should compass a slaughter
even more accursed than that. For if he had sinned wittingly, and been
sacrificed, this would only have been child-murder; but now sinning
ignorantly, (for he had not heard of the oath), if he had been slain, he
would have made the anguish of his father double; for he would have had
both to sacrifice a son, and a son who had done no wrong. But now to
proceed with the rest of the history; "When he had eaten," it is said, "His
eyes saw clearly." And here it condemns the king of great folly; shewing
that hunger had almost blinded the whole army, and diffused much
darkness over their eyes. Afterwards some one of the soldiers, perceiving
the action, saith, "Thy father swear an oath upon all the people, saying,
cursed be the man who eateth any food today. And the people were faint.
And Jonathan said, My father hath made away with the land." What does
he mean by the word, "made away with?" Why, that he had ruined, or

destroyed them all. Hence, when the oath was transgressed, all kept
silence, and no one dared to bring forth the criminal; and this became
afterwards no small matter of blame, for not only are those who break an
oath, but those also who are privy to it and conceal it, partakers of the
crime.

9. But let us see what follows; "And Saul said, Let us go down after the
strangers, and spoil them. And the priest said, Let us draw near hither
unto God." For in old times God led forth the people to battle; and
without His consent no one dared to engage in the fight, and war was with
them a matter of religion. For not from weakness of body, but from their
sins they were conquered, whenever they were conquered; and not by
might and courage, but by favor from above they prevailed, whenever they
did prevail. Victory and defeat were also to them a means of training, and a
school of virtue. And not to them only, but to their adversaries; for this
was made evident to them too, that the fate of battle with the Jews was
decided not by the nature of their arms, but by the life and good works of
the warriors. The Midianites at least perceiving this, and knowing that
people to be invincible, and that to have attacked them with arms and
engines of war would have been fruitless, and that it was only possible to
conquer them by sin, having decked out handsome virgins, and set them in
the array, excited the soldiers to lasciviousness, endeavoring by means of
fornication to deprive them of God's assistance; which accordingly
happened. For when they had fallen into sin, they became an easy prey to
all; and those whom weapons, and horses, and soldiers, and so many
engines availed not to capture, sin by its nature delivered over bound to
their enemies. Shields, and spears, and darts were all alike found useless;
but beauty of visage and wantonness of soul overpowered these brave
men.

10. Therefore one gives this admonition; "Observe not the beauty of a
strange woman, and meet not a woman addicted to fornication. For honey
distills from the lips of an harlot, which at the time may seem smooth to
thy throat, but afterward thou wilt find it more bitter than gall, and
sharper than a two-edged sword." For the harlot knows not how to love,
but only to ensnare; her kiss hath poison, and her mouth a pernicious drug.
And if this does not immediately appear, it is the more necessary to avoid
her on that account, because she veils that destruction, and keeps that

death concealed, and suffers it not to become manifest at the first. So that
if any one pursues pleasure, and a life full of gladness, let him avoid the
society of fornicating women, for they fill the minds of their lovers with a
thousand conflicts and tumults, setting in motion against them continual
strifes and contentions, by means of their words, and all their actions. And
just as it is with those who are the most virulent enemies, so the object of
their actions and schemes is to plunge their lovers into shame and poverty,
and the worst extremities. And in the same manner as hunters, when they
have spread out their nets, endeavor to drive thither the wild animals, in
order that they may put them to death, so also is it with these women.
When they have spread out on every side the wings of lasciviousness by
means of the eyes, and dress, and language, they afterwards drive in their
lovers, and bind them; nor do they give over until they have drunk up their
blood, insulting them at last, and mocking their folly, and pouring over
them a flood of ridicule. And indeed such a man is no longer worthy of
compassion but deserves to be derided and jeered, since he is found more
irrational than a woman, and a harlot besides. Therefore the Wise Man
gives this word of exhortation again, "Drink waters from thine own
cistern, and from the fountain of thine own well." And again; "Let the hind
of thy friendship, and the foal of thy favors, consort with thee." These
things he speaks of a wife associated with her husband by the law of
marriage. Why leavest thou her who is a helpmate, to run to one who is a
plotter against thee? Why dost thou turn away from her who is the
partner of thy living, and court her who would subvert thy life? The one is
thy member and body, the other is a sharp sword. Therefore, beloved, flee
fornication; both for its present evils, and for its future punishment.

11. Perchance we may seem to have fallen aside from the subject; but to
say thus much, is no departure from it. For we do not wish to read you
histories merely for their own sake, but that you may correct each of the
passions which trouble you: therefore also we make these frequent
appeals, preparing our discourse for you in all varieties of style; since it is
probable that in so large an assembly, there is a great variety of
distempers; and our task is to cure not one only, but many different
wounds; and therefore it is necessary that the medicine of instruction
should be various. Let us however return thither from whence we made
this digression: "And the Priest said, Let us draw near unto God. And Saul

asked counsel of God. Shall I go down after the strangers? Wilt Thou
deliver them into my hands? But on that day the Lord answered him not."
Observe the benignity and mildness of God who loveth man. For He did
not launch a thunderbolt, nor shake the earth; but what friends do to
friends, when treated contemptuously, this the Lord did towards the
servant. He only received him silently, speaking by His silence, and by it
giving utterance to all His wrath. This Saul understood, and said, as it is
recorded, "Bring near hither all the tribes of the people, and know and see
in whom this sin hath been this day. For as the Lord liveth, Who hath
saved Israel, though the answer be against Jonathan my son, he shall
surely die." Seest thou his rashness? Perceiving that his first oath had been
transgressed, he does not even then learn self-control, but adds again a
second. Consider also the malignity of the devil. For since he was aware
that frequently the son when discovered, and publicly arraigned, is able by
the very sight at once to make the father relent, and might soften the king's
wrath, he anticipated his sentence by the obligation of a second oath;
holding him by a kind of double bond, and not permitting him to be the
master of his own determination, but forcing him on every side to that
iniquitous murder. And even whilst the offender was not yet produced, he
hath passed judgment, and whilst ignorant of the criminal, he gave
sentence. The father became the executioner; and before the enquiry
declared his verdict of condemnation! What could be more irrational than
this proceeding?

12. Saul then having made this declaration, the people were more afraid
than before. and all were in a state of great trembling and terror. But the
devil rejoiced, at having rendered them all thus anxious. There was no one,
we are told, of all the people, who answered. "And Saul said, Ye will be in
bondage, and I, and Jonathan my son, will be in bondage." But what he
means is to this effect; "You are aiming at nothing else, than to deliver
yourselves to your enemies, and to become slaves instead of free men;
whilst you provoke God against you, in not delivering up the guilty
person." Observe also another contradiction produced by the oath. It had
been fitting, if he wished to find the author of this guilt, to have made no
such threat, nor to have bound himself to vengeance by an oath; that
becoming less afraid, they might more readily bring the offender to light?
But under the influence of anger, and great madness, and his former

unreasonableness, he again does that which is directly contrary to what he
desires. What need is there to enlarge? He commits the matter to a decision
by lot; and the lot falleth upon Saul, and Jonathan; "And Saul said, Cast
ye the lot between me and Jonathan; and they cast the lot, and Jonathan
was taken. And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me, what hast thou done? And
Jonathan told him, saying, I only tasted a little honey on the top of the rod
which is in my hand, and, lo! I must die." Who is there that these words
would not have moved and turned to pity? Consider what a tempest Saul
then sustained, his bowels being torn with anguish, and the most profound
precipice appearing on either hand! But nevertheless he did not learn
self-control, for what does he say? "God do so to me, and more also; for
thou shall surely die this day." Behold again the third oath, and not simply
the third, but one with a very narrow limit as to time; for he does not
merely say, "Thou shall die;" but, "this day." For the devil was hurrying,
hurrying him on, constraining him and driving him to this impious murder.
Wherefore he did not suffer him to assign any future day for the sentence,
lest there should be any correction of the evil by delay. And the people
said to Saul, "God do so to us, and more also, if he shall be put to death,
who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel. As the Lord liveth, there
shall not an hair of his head fall to the ground; because he hath wrought a
merciful thing from God today." Behold how, in the second place, the
people also swore, and swore contrary to the king.

13. Now recollect, I pray, the cord pulled by the children, and breaking,
and throwing on their backs those who pull it. Saul swore not once or
twice, but several times. The people swore what was contrary, and
strained in the opposite direction. Of necessity then it followed, that the
oath must in any wise be broken through. For it were impossible that all
these should keep their oaths. And now tell me not of the event of this
transaction; but consider how many evils were springing from it; and how
the devil from thence was preparing the tragedy and usurpation of
Absalom. For if the king had chosen to resist, and to proceed to the
execution of his oath, the people would have been in array against him; and
a grievous rebellion would have been set on foot. And again, if the son
consulting his own safety had chosen to throw himself into the hands of
the army, he would straightway have become a parricide. Seest thou not,
that rebellion, as well as child-murder, and parricide, and battle, and civil

war, and slaughter, and blood, and dead bodies without number, are the
consequences of one oath. For if war had perchance broken out, Saul might
have been slain, and Jonathan perchance too, and many of the soldiers
would have been cut to pieces; and after all the keeping of the oath would
not have been forwarded. So that it is not for thee to consider that these
events did not occur, but to mark this point, that it was the nature of the
case to necessitate the occurrence of such things. However, the people
prevailed. Come then, let us reckon up the perjuries that were the
consequence. The oath of Saul was first broken by his son; and again a
second and a third, concerning the slaying of his son, by Saul himself. And
the people seemed to have kept their oath. Yet if any one closely examines
the matter, they too all became liable to the charge of perjury. For they
compelled the father of Jonathan to perjure himself, by not surrendering
the son to the father. Seest thou how many persons one oath made
obnoxious to perjury, willingly and unwillingly; how many evils it
wrought, how many deaths it caused?

14. Now in the commencement of this discourse I promised to shew that
perjury would in any case result from opposite oaths; but truly the course
of the history has proved more than I was establishing. It has exhibited not
one, two, or three individuals, but a whole people, and not one, two, or
three oaths, but many more transgressed. I might also make mention of
another instance, and shew from that, how one oath caused a still greater
and more grievous calamity. For one oath entailed upon all the Jews the
capture of their cities, as well as of their wives and children; the ravages of
fire, the invasion of barbarians, the pollution of sacred things, and ten
thousand other evils yet more distressing. But I perceive that the discourse
is running to a great length. Therefore, dismissing here the narration of this
history, I beseech you, together with the beheading of John, to tell one
another also of the murder of Jonathan, and the general destruction of a
whole people (which did not indeed take place, but which was involved in
the obligation of the oaths); and both at home, and in public, and with
your wives, and friends, and with neighbors, and with all men in general, to
make an earnest business of this matter, and not to think it a sufficient
apology that we can plead custom.

15. For that this excuse is a mere pretext, and that the fault arises not from
custom but from listlessness, I will endeavor to convince you from what

has already occurred. The Emperor has shut up the baths of the city, and
has given orders that no one shall bathe; and no one has dared to transgress
the law, nor to find fault with what has taken place, nor to allege custom.
But even though in weak health perchance, men and women, and children
and old men; and many women but recently eased from the pangs of
childbirth; though all requiring this as a necessary medicine; bear with the
injunction, willingly or unwillingly; and neither plead infirmity of body,
nor the tyranny of custom, nor that they are punished, whereas others
were the offenders, nor any other thing of this kind, but contentedly put
up with this punishment, because they were in expectation of greater evils;
and pray daily that the wrath of the Emperor may go no further. Seest
thou that where there is fear, the bond of custom is easily relaxed, although
it be of exceedingly long standing, and great necessity? To be denied the
use of the bath is certainly a grievous matter. For although we be never so
philosophic, the nature of the body proves incapable of deriving any
benefit for its own health, from the philosophy of the soul. But as to
abstinence from swearing, this is exceedingly easy, and brings no injury at
all; none to the body, none to the mind; but, on the contrary, great gain,
much safety, and abundant wealth. How then is it any thing but absurd, to
submit to the greatest hardships, when an Emperor enjoins it; but when
God commands nothing grievous nor difficult, but what is very tolerable
and easy, to despise or to deride it, and to advance custom as an excuse?
Let us not, I entreat, so far despise our own safety, but let us fear God as
we fear man. I know that ye shudder at hearing this, but what deserves to
be shuddered at is that ye do not pay even so much respect to God; and
that whilst ye diligently observe the Emperor's decrees, ye trample under
foot those which are divine, and which have come down from heaven; and
consider diligence concerning these a secondary object. For what apology
will there be left for us, and what pardon, if after so much admonition we
persist in the same practices. For I began this admonition at the very
commencement of the calamity which has taken hold of the city, and that
is now on the point of coming to an end; but we have not as yet
thoroughly put in practice even one precept. How then can we ask a
removal of the evils which still beset us, when we have not been able to
perform a single precept? How can we expect a change for the better?
How shall we pray? With what tongue shall we call upon God? For if we
perform the law, we shall enjoy much pleasure, when the Emperor is

reconciled to the city. But if we remain in the transgression, shame and
reproach will be ours on every hand, inasmuch as when God hath freed us
from the danger we have continued in the same listlessness.

16. Oh! that it were possible for me to undress the souls of those who
swear frequently, and to expose to view the wounds and the bruises which
they receive daily from oaths! We should then need neither ad. monition
nor counsel; for the sight of these wounds would avail more powerfully
than all that could be said, to withdraw from their wickedness even those
who are most addicted o this wicked practice. Nevertheless, if it be not
possible to spread before the eyes the shameful state of their soul, it may
be possible to expose it to the thoughts, and to display it in its rottenness
and corruption. For as it saith, "As a servant that is continually beaten
will not be clear of a bruise, so he that sweareth and nameth God
continually will not be purified of his sin." It is impossible, utterly
impossible, that the mouth which is practiced in swearing, should not
frequently commit perjury. Therefore, I beseech you all, by laying aside
this dreadful and wicked habit, to win another crown. And since it is every
where sung of our city, that first of all the cities of the world, she bound
on her brow the name of Christians, so let all have to say, that Antioch
alone, of all the cities throughout the world, hath expelled all oaths from
her own borders. Yea, rather, should this be done, she will not be herself
crowned alone, but will also carry others along with her to the same pitch
of zeal. And as the name of Christians having had its origin here, hath as it
were from a kind of fountain overflown all the world, even so this good
work, having taken its root and starting-point from hence, will make all
men that inhabit the earth your disciples; so that a double and treble
reward may arise to you, at once on account of your own good works, and
of the instruction afforded to others. This will be to you the brightest of
diadems! This will make your city a mother city, not on earth, but in the
heavens! This will stand by us at That Day, and bring us the crown of
righteousness; which God grant that we may all obtain, through the grace
and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father,
together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, now and ever, and world without
end. Amen.

HOMILY 15

Again on the calamity of the city of Antioch. That fear is every way
profitable. That sorrow is more useful than laughter. And upon the
saying, "Remember that thou walkest in the midst of snares." And
that it is worse to exact an oath, than to commit murder

1. TODAY, and on the former Sabbath, it had behooved us to enter on the
subject of fasting; nor let any one suppose that what I said was
unseasonable. For on the days of the fast, counsel and admonition on that
subject are indeed not at all necessary; the very presence of these days
exciting even those who are the most remiss to the effort of fasting. But
since many men, both when about to enter upon the fast, as if the belly
were on the point of being delivered over to a sort of lengthened siege, lay
in beforehand a stock of gluttony and drunkenness; and again, on being set
at liberty, going forth as from a long famine and a grievous prison, run to
the table with unseemly greediness, just as if they were striving to undo
again the advantage gained through the fast, by an excess of gluttony; it
might have been needful, that then as well as now, we should agitate the
subject of temperance. Nevertheless, we have neither lately said any thing
of that kind, neither shall we now speak upon it. For the fear of the
impending calamity suffices, instead of the strongest admonition and
counsel, to sober the soul of every one. For who is there so miserable and
degraded, as to be drunken in such a tempest? Who is there so insensible,
when the city is thus agitated, and such a shipwreck is threatened, as not
to become abstemious and watchful, and more thoroughly reformed by
this distress than by any other sort of admonition and counsel? For
discourse will not be able to effect as much as fear does. And this very
thing it is now possible to shew from the events which have taken place.
How many words then did we spend before this in exhorting many that
were listless, and counseling them to abstain from the theatres, and the
impurities of these places! And still they did not abstain; but always on
this day they flocked together to the unlawful spectacles of the dancers;
and they held their diabolical assembly in opposition to the full
congregation of God's Church; so that their vehement shouts, born in the
air from that place, resounded against the psalms which we were singing

here. But behold, now whilst we were keeping silence, and saying nothing
on the subject, they of themselves have shut up their orchestra; and the
Hippodrome has been left deserted! Before this, many of our own people
used to hasten to them; but now they are all fled hither from thence to the
church, and all alike join in praising our God!

2. Seest thou what advantage is come of fear? If fear were not a good thing,
fathers would not have set tutors over their children; nor lawgivers
magistrates for cities. What can be more grievous than hell? Yet nothing is
more profitable than the fear of it; for the fear of hell will bring us the
crown of the kingdom. Where fear is, there is no envy; where fear is, the
love of money does not disturb; where fear is, wrath is quenched, evil
concupiscence is repressed, and every unreasonable passion is
exterminated. And even as in a house, where there is always a soldier
under arms, no robber, nor house-breaker, nor any such evil doer will dare
to make his appearance; so also while fear holds possession of our minds,
none of the base passions will readily attack us, but all fly off and are
banished, being driven away in every direction by the despotic power of
fear. And not only this advantage do we gain from fear, but also another
which is far greater. For not only, indeed, does it expel our evil passions,
but it also introduces every kind of virtue with great facility. Where fear
exists, there is zeal in alms-giving, and intensity of prayer, and tears warm
and frequent, and groans fraught with compunction. For nothing so
swallows up sin, and makes virtue to increase and flourish, as a perpetual
state of dread. Therefore it is impossible for him who does not live in fear
to act aright; as, on the other hand, it is impossible that the man who lives
in fear can go wrong.

3. Let us not then grieve, beloved, let us not despond on account of the
present tribulation, but let us admire the well-devised plan of God's
wisdom. For by these very means through which the devil hoped to
overturn our city, hath God restored and corrected it. The devil animated
certain lawless men to treat the very statues of the Emperor
contemptuously, in order that the very foundations of the city might be
razed. But God employed this same circumstance for our greater
correction; driving out all sloth by the dread of the expected wrath: and the
thing has turned out directly opposite to what the devil wished, by the
means which he had himself prepared. For our city is being purified every

day; and the lanes and crossings, and places of public concourse, are freed
from lascivious and voluptuous songs; and turn where we will there are
supplications, and thanksgivings, and tears, instead of rude laughter; there
are words of sound wisdom instead of obscene language, and our whole
city has become a Church, the workshops being closed, and all being
engaged throughout the day in these general prayers; and calling upon God
in one united voice with much earnestness. What preaching, what
admonition, what counsel, what length of time had ever availed to
accomplish these things?

4. For this then let us be thankful, and let us not be petulant or
discontented; for that fear is a good thing, what we have said hath made
manifest. But hear Solomon thus uttering a lesson of wisdom concerning it;
Solomon, who was nourished in every luxury, and enjoyed much security.
What then does he say? "It is better to go to the house of mourning than
to the house of laughter." What sayest thou, I ask? Is it better to go where
there is weeping, lamentation, and groans, and anguish, and so much
sadness, than where there is the dance, the cymbals, and laughter, and
luxury, and full eating and drinking? Yes, verily, he replies. And tell me
why is it so, and for what reason? Because, at the former place, insolence
is bred, at the latter, sobriety. And when a person goes to the banquet of
one more opulent, he will no longer behold his own house with the same
pleasure, but he comes back to his wife in a discontented mood; and in
discontent he partakes of his own table; and is peevish towards his own
servants, and his own children, and every body in his house; perceiving his
own poverty the more forcibly by the wealth of others. And this is not
the only evil; but that he also often envies him who hath invited him to the
feast, and returns home having received no benefit at all. But with regard to
the house of mourning, nothing of this sort can be said. On the contrary,
much spiritual wisdom is to be gained there, as well as sobriety. For when
once a person hath passed the threshold of a house which contains a
corpse, and hath seen the departed one lying speechless, and the wife
tearing her hair, mangling her cheeks, and wounding her arms, he is
subdued; his countenance becomes sad; and every one of those who sit
down together can say to his neighbor but this, "We are nothing, and our
wickedness is inexpressible!" What can be more full of wisdom than these
words, when we both acknowledge the insignificance of our nature, and

accuse our own wickedness, and account present things as nothing? Giving
utterance, though in different words, to that very sentiment of Solomon -
that sentiment which is so marvelous and pregnant with Divine wisdom -
"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." He who enters the house of mourning,
weeps forthwith for the departed, even though he be an enemy. Seest thou
how much better that house is than the other? for there, though he be a
friend, he envies; but here, though he be an enemy, he weeps. This is a
thing which God requires of us above all, that we should not insult over
those who have occasioned us grief. And not only may we gather these
advantages, but others also which are not less than these. For each one is
also put in mind of his own sins, and of the fearful Tribunal; of the great
Account, and of the Judgment; and although he may have been suffering a
thousand evils from others, and have a cause for sadness at home, he will
receive and take back with him the medicine for all these things. For
reflecting that he himself, and all those who swell with pride, will in a little
while suffer the same thing; and that all present things, whether pleasant
or painful, are transitory; he thus returns to his house, disburdened of all
sadness and envy, with a light and buoyant heart; and hence he will
hereafter be more meek, and gentle, and benignant to all; as well as more
wise; the fear of things to come having made its way into his soul, and
consumed all the thorns.

6. All this Solomon perceived when he said, "It is better to go to the house
of mourning than to the house of drinking." From the one grows
listlessness, from the other an earnest anxiety. From the one, contempt;
from the other, fear; a fear which conducts us to the practice of every
virtue. If fear were not a good thing, Christ would not have expended such
long and frequent discourses on the subject of punishment, and vengeance
to come. Fear is nothing less than a wall, and a defense, and an impregnable
tower. For indeed we stand in need of much defense, seeing that there are
many ambushments on every side. Even as this same Solomon again says
admonishingly, "Perceive that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that
thou walkest on the battlements of cities.'" Oh with how many good
things is this saying pregnant! Yea, not less than the former! Let us then,
write it, each of us, upon our minds, and carry it about ever in our
memories, and we shall not easily commit sin. Let us write it there, having
first learnt it with the utmost exactness. For he does not say, "Observe"

that thou goest in the midst of snares; but, "Perceive!" And for what
reason did he say, "Discern?" He tells us that the snare is concealed; for
this is indeed a snare, when the destruction does not appear openly, and
the injury is not manifest, which lies hidden on all sides. Therefore he
says, "Perceive!" Thou needest much reflection and diligent scrutiny. For
even as boys conceal traps with earth, so the devil covers up our sins with
the pleasures of this life.

7. But" perceive;" scrutinizing diligently; and if any kind of gain falls in
thy way, look not only at the gain, but inspect it carefully, lest somewhere
death and sin lurk within the gain; and shouldest thou perceive this, fly
from it. Again, when some delight or pleasure may chance to present itself,
look not only at the pleasure; but lest somewhere in the depth of the
pleasure some iniquity should lie enveloped, search closely, and if thou
discoverest it, hasten away! And should any one counsel, or flatter, or
cajole, or promise honors, or any other such thing whatever, let us make
the closest investigation; and look at the matter on all sides, lest something
pernicious, something perilous, should perchance befall us through this
advice, or honor, or attention, and we run upon it hastily and unwittingly.
For if there were only one or two snares, the precaution would be easy.
But now, hear how Solomon speaks when he wishes to set forth the
multitude of these; "Perceive that thou goest in the midst of snares;" he
does not say, that thou "goest by" snares, but "in the midst" of snares. On
either side are the pit-falls; on either side the deceits. One goes into the
forum; one sees an enemy; one is inflamed by the bare sight of him! one
sees a friend honored; one is envious! One sees a poor man; one despises
and takes no notice of him! One sees a rich man; one envies him! One sees
some one injuriously treated; one recoils in disgust! One sees some one
acting injuriously; one is indignant! One sees a handsome woman, and is
caught! Seest thou, beloved, how many snares there are? Therefore it is
said, "Remember that thou goest in the midst of snares." There are snares
in the house, snares at the table, and snares in social intercourse. Very
often a person unwittingly, in the confidence of friendship, gives utterance
to some particular of those matters which ought not to be repeated again,
and so great a peril is brought about, that the whole family is thereby
ruined!

8. On every side then let us search closely into these matters. Often has a
wife, often have children, often have friends, often have neighbors, proved
a snare to the unheeding! And why, it is asked, are there so many snares?
That we may not fly low, but seek the things that are above. For just as
birds, as long as they cleave the upper air, are not easily caught; so also
thou, as long as thou lookest to things above, wilt not be easily captured,
whether by a snare, or by any other device. The devil is a fowler. Soar,
then, too high for his arrows. The man who hath mounted aloft will no
longer admire any thing in the affairs of this life. But as when we have
ascended to the top of the mountains, the city and its walls seem to us to
be but small, and the men appear to us to be going along upon the earth
like ants; so when thou hast ascended to the heights of spiritual wisdom,
nothing upon the earth will be able to fascinate thee; but every thing, yea
even riches, and glory, and honor, and whatever else there be of that kind,
will appear insignificant when thou regardest heavenly things. According
to Paul all the glories of the present life appeared trifling, and more
unprofitable than dead things. Hence his exclamation, "The world is
crucified unto me." Hence also his admonition, "Set your affections on
things above." Above? What kinds of things do you speak of pray? Where
the sun is, where the moon is? Nay, saith he. But where then? Where
angels are? where archangels? where the cherubim? where the seraphim
are? Nay, saith he But where then? "Where Christ sitteth at the right hand
of God."

9. Let us obey then, and let us think of this continually, that even as to the
bird caught in the snare, wings are of no service, but he beats them about
vainly, and to no purpose; so also to thee there is no utility in thy
reasonings, when once thou art powerfully captivated by wicked lust, but
struggle as much as thou mayest, thou art captured! For this reason wings
are given to birds; that they may avoid snares. For this reason men have
the power of thinking; that they may avoid sin. What pardon then, or
what excuse will be ours, when we become more senseless than the brutes?
For the bird which has once been captured by the snare, yet afterwards
escaped, and the deer which has fallen into the net, but has broken through
it, are hard to be captured again with the like; since experience becomes a
teacher of caution to every one. But we, though often snared in the same
nets, fall into the same again; and though honored with reason, we do not

imitate the forethought and care of the irrational animals! Hence how often
do we, from beholding a woman, suffer a thousand evils; returning home,
and entertaining an inordinate desire, and experiencing anguish for many
days; yet, nevertheless, we are not made discreet; but when we have
scarcely cured one wound, we again fall into the same mischief, and are
caught by the same means; and for the sake of the brief pleasure of a
glance, we sustain a kind of lengthened and continual torment. But if we
learn constantly to repeat to ourselves this saying, we shall be kept from
all these grievous evils.

10. The beauty of woman is the greatest snare. Or rather, not the beauty
of woman, but unchastened gazing! For we should not accuse the objects,
but ourselves, and our own carelessness. Nor should we say, Let there be
no women, but Let there be no adulteries. We should not say, Let there be
no beauty, but Let there be no fornication. We should not say, Let there be
no belly, but let there be no gluttony; for the belly makes not the gluttony,
but our negligence. We should not say, that it is because of eating and
drinking that all these evils exist; for it is not because of this, but because
of our carelessness and insatiableness. Thus the devil neither ate nor drank,
and yet he fell! Paul ate and drank, and ascended up to heaven! How many
do I hear say, Let there be no poverty! Therefore let us stop the mouths
of those who murmur at such things. For it is blasphemy to utter such
complaints. To such then, let us say, Let there be no meanness of spirit.
For poverty brings innumerable good things into our state of life, and
without poverty riches would be unprofitable. Hence we should accuse
neither the one nor the other of these; for poverty and riches are both alike
weapons which will tend to virtue, if we are willing. As then the
courageous soldier, whichever weapon he takes, displays his own virtue,
so the unmanly and cowardly one is encumbered by either. And that thou
mayest learn that this is true, remember, I pray, the case of Job; who
became both rich, and likewise poor, and handled both these weapons
alike, and conquered in both. When he was rich, he said, "My door was
open to every comer." But when he had become poor, "The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away. As it seemed good unto the Lord, so hath it
come to pass." When he was rich, he shewed much hospitality; when he
was poor, much patience. And thou, then, - art thou rich? Display much
bountifulness! Hast thou become poor? Shew much endurance and

patience! For neither is wealth an evil, nor poverty in itself; but these
things, either of them, become so according to the free choice of those who
make use of them. Let us school ourselves then to entertain no such
opinions on these subjects; nor let us accuse the works of God, but the
wicked choice of men. Riches are not able to profit the little-minded: nor is
poverty able ever to injure the magnanimous.

11. Let us then discern the snares, and walk far off from them! Let us
discern the precipices, and not even approach them! This will be the
foundation of our greatest safety not only to avoid things sinful, but those
things which seem indeed to be indifferent, and yet are apt to make us
stumble towards sin. For example; to laugh, to speak jocosely, does not
seem an acknowledged sin, but it leads to acknowledged sin. Thus laughter
often gives birth to foul discourse, and foul discourse to actions still more
foul. Often from words and laughter proceed railing and insult; and from
railing and insult, blows and wounds; and from blows and wounds,
slaughter and murder. If, then, thou wouldest take good counsel for
thyself, avoid not merely foul words, and foul deeds, or blows, and
wounds, and murders, but unseasonable laughter, itself, and the very
language of banter; since these things have proved the root of subsequent
evils. Therefore Paul saith, "Let no foolish talking nor jesting proceed out
of thy mouth." For although this seems to be a small thing in itself, it
becomes, however, the cause of much mischief to us. Again, to live in
luxury does not seem to be a manifest and admitted crime; but then it
brings forth in us great evils, - drunkenness, violence, extortion, and
rapine. For the prodigal and sumptuous liver, bestowing extravagant
service upon the belly, is often compelled to steal, and to seize the
property of others, and to use extortion and violence. If, then, thou
avoidest luxurious living, thou removest the foundation of extortion, and
rapine, and drunkenness, and a thousand other evils; cutting away the root
of iniquity from its extremity. Hence Paul saith, that "she who liveth in
pleasure is dead while she liveth." Again, to go to the theatres, or to
survey the horse-race, or to play at dice, does not seem, to most men, to
be an admitted crime; but it introduces into our life an infinite host of
miseries. For spending time in the theatres produces fornication,
intemperance, and every kind of impurity. The spectacle of the horse-race
also brings about fightings, railings, blows, insults, and lasting enmities.

And a passion for dice-playing hath often caused blasphemies, injuries,
anger, reproaches, and a thousand other things more fearful still.

12. Therefore, let us not only avoid sins, but those things too which seem
to be indifferent, yet by degrees lead us into these misdeeds. He, indeed,
who walks by the side of a precipice, even though he may not fall over,
trembles; and very often he is overset by this same trembling, and falls to
the bottom. So also he who does not avoid sins from afar, but walks near
them, will live in fear, and will often fall into them. Besides, he who
eagerly looks at strange beauties, although he may not commit adultery,
hath in so doing entertained lust; and hath become already an adulterer
according to the declaration of Christ; and often by this very lust he is
carried on to the actual sin. Let us then withdraw ourselves far from sins.
Dost thou wish to live soberly? Avoid not only adultery, but also the
licentious glance! Dost thou wish to be far removed from foul words?
Avoid not only foul words, but also inordinate laughter, and every kind of
lust. Dost thou wish to keep far from committing murders? Avoid railing
too. Dost thou wish to keep aloof from drunkenness? Avoid luxury and
sumptuous tables, and pluck up the vice by the roots.

13. The licentiousness of the tongue is a great snare, and needs a strong
bridle. Therefore also some one saith. "His own lips are a powerful snare
to a man, and he is snared by the words of his own mouth." Above all the
other members, then, let us control this; let us bridle it; and let us expel
from the mouth railings, and contumelies, and foul and slanderous
language, and the evil habit of oaths. For again our discourse hath brought
us to the same exhortation. But I had arranged with your charity,
yesterday, that I would say no more concerning this precept, forasmuch as
enough has been said upon it on all the foregoing days. But what is to
become of me? I cannot bear to desist from this counsel, until I see that ye
have put it in practice; since Paul also, when he saith to the Galatians,
"Henceforth let no man trouble me," appears again to have met and
addressed them. Such are the paternal bowels; although they say they will
depart, yet they depart not, until they see that their sons are chastened.
Have ye heard today what the prophet speaks to us concerning oaths; "I
lifted up mine eyes, and I saw," saith he, "and, behold, a flying sickle, the
length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits; and he
said to me, What seest thou? and I said, I see a flying sickle, twenty cubits

in length, and ten cubits in breadth. It shall also enter into the house," saith
he, ‘of every one that sweareth in my name, and shall remain in the midst,
and shall pull down the stones and the wood." What, forsooth, is this
which is here spoken? and for what reason is it in the form of a "sickle,"
and that a "flying sickle," that vengeance is seen to pursue the swearers?
In order that thou mayest see that the judgment is inevitable, and the
punishment not to be eluded. For from a flying sword some one might
perchance be able to escape, but from a sickle, falling upon the neck, and
acting in the place of a cord, no one can escape. And when wings too are
added, what further hope is there of safety? But on what account doth it
pull down the stones and the wood of the swearer's house? In order that
the ruin may be a correction to all. For since it is necessary that the earth
must hide the swearer when dead; the very sight of his ruined house, now
become a heap, will be an admonition to all who pass by and observe it,
not to venture on the like, lest they suffer the like; and it will be a lasting
witness against the sin of the departed. The sword is not so piercing as the
nature of an oath! The saber is not so destructive as the stroke of an oath!
The swearer, although he seems to live, is already dead, and hath received
the fatal blow. And as the man who hath received the halter, before he hath
gone out of the city and come to the pit, and seen the executioner standing
over him, is dead from the time he passed the doors of the hall of justice:
so also the swearer.

14. All this let us consider, and let us not put our brethren on oath. What
dost thou, O man? At the sacred table thou exactest an oath, and where
Christ lies slain, there thou slayest thine own brother. Robbers, indeed,
murder on the highways; but thou slayest the son in the presence of the
mother: committing a murder more accursed than Cain himself; for he slew
his brother in solitude and only with present death; but thou slayest thy
brother in the midst of the church, and that with the deathless death that is
to come! For think you that the church was made for this purpose, that
we might swear? Yea, for this it was made, that we might pray! Is the
Table placed there, that we may make adjurations? It is placed there to
this end, that we may loose sins, not that we may bind them. But thou, if
thou heedest nothing else, reverence at least that book, which thou
reachest forth in putting the oath; and open the Gospel. which thou takest
in hand when thou biddest swear; and when thou hearest what Christ there

declares concerning oaths, shudder and desist! What then does He there
say concerning oaths? "But I say unto you, Swear not at all." And dost
thou convert the Law which forbids swearing into an oath. Oh, what
contempt! Oh, what outrage! For thou doest just the same thing as if any
one should bid the lawgiver, who prohibits murder, become himself a
party to the murder. Not so much do I lament and weep, when I hear that
some persons are slain upon the highway, as I groan, and shed tears, and
am horrified, when I see any one coming near this Table, placing his hands
upon it, and touching the Gospels, and swearing! Art thou in doubt, I ask,
concerning money, and wouldest thou slay a soul? What gainest thou to
match the injury thou doest to thine own soul, and to thy neighbor? If
thou believest that the man is true, do not impose the obligation of the
oath; but if thou knowest him to be a liar, do not force him to commit
perjury. "But that I may have a full assurance:" saith one. Verily, when
thou hast not sworn him, then thou wilt receive a good and full assurance.

15. For now, when thou hast returned home, thou wilt be continually the
prey of conscience, whilst reasoning thus with thyself; "Was it to no
purpose, then, that I put him upon his oath? Was he not really perjured?
Have I not become the cause of the sin?" But if thou dost not put him
upon his oath, thou wilt receive much consolation on returning home,
rendering thanks to God, and saying, "Blessed be God, that I restrained
myself, and did not compel him to swear vainly, and to no purpose. Away
with gold! Perish the money!" for that which specially gives us assurance
is, that we did not transgress the law, nor compel another to do it.
Consider, for Whose sake thou didst not put any one on his oath; and this
will suffice thee for refreshment and consolation. Often, indeed, when a
fight takes place, we bear being insulted with fortitude, and we say to the
insulter, "What shall I do with thee? Such an one hinders me, who is thy
patron; he keeps back my hands." And this is sufficient to console us. So
when thou art about to put any one on his oath, restrain thyself; and stop;
and say to him who is about to swear, "What shall I do with thee? God
hath forbidden me to put any one on oath. He now holds me back." This
suffices both for the honor of the Lawgiver, and for thy safety, and for
keeping him in fear who is ready to swear. For when he seeth that we are
thus afraid to put others on oath, much more will he himself be afraid to
swear rashly. Wouldest thou say thus, thy return to thine own home

would be with much fullness of assurance. Hear God, therefore, in His
Commandments, that He may Himself hear thee in thy prayers! This
word shall be written in heaven, and shall stand by thee on the Day of
Judgment, and shall discharge many sins.

16. This also let us consider not only with respect to an oath, but to every
thing. And when we are about to do any good action for God's sake, and it
is found to bring loss with it, let us look not merely at the loss connected
with the matter, but at the gain which we shall reap by doing it for God.
That is to say, Hath any one insulted thee? Bear it nobly! And thou wilt
do so, if thou thinkest not of the insult merely, but of the dignity of Him
who commands thee to bear it, and thou bearest it meekly. Hast thou given
an alms? Think not of the outlay, but of the produce which arises from the
outlay. Hast thou been mulcted of money? Give thanks, and regard not
only the pain which is the result of the loss, but the gain which comes of
thanksgiving. If we thus regulate ourselves, none of those heavy events
which may befall us will give us pain; but from those things which may
seem to be grievous, we shall be even gainers, and loss will be sweeter and
more desired than wealth, pain than pleasure, and mirth and insult than
honor. Thus all things adverse will turn to our gain. And here we shall
enjoy much tranquillity, and there we shall attain the kingdom of heaven;
which God grant that we may all be deemed worthy to obtain? by the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom and
with Whom, to the Father with the Holy Spirit, be glory, dominion, and
honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.

HOMILY 16

This Homily was delivered on the occasion of the Prefect entering
the Church, for the purpose of pacifying the minds of the people, in
consequence of a rumor of an intended sack having been
announced to him, when all were meditating flight. It treats also on
the subject of avoiding oaths, and on the words of the Apostle,
"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ."

1. I COMMEND the Prefect's consideration, that seeing the city agitated, and
every one purposing a flight, he hath come here and afforded you
consolation, and hath led you to entertain favorable hopes. But for you I
blushed, and was ashamed, that after these long and frequent discourses ye
should have needed consolation from without. I longed that the earth
would open and swallow me up, when I heard him discoursing with you,
alternately administering comfort, or blaming such ill-timed and senseless
cowardice. For it was not becoming, that you should be instructed by him;
but you ought yourselves to be teachers to all the unbelievers. Paul did not
permit even going to law before the unbelievers; but thou, after so much
admonition of our Fathers, hast needed teachers from without; and certain
vagabonds and miscreants have again unsettled this great city, and set it
upon flight. With what eyes shall we hereafter look upon the unbelievers,
we who were so timid and cowardly? With what tongue shall we speak to
them, and persuade them to exercise courage as to approaching evils, when
we became through this alarm more timid than any hare? "But what could
we do," says some one, "we are but men!" This is indeed the very reason
why we ought not to be terrified, because we are men, and not brutes. For
these are scared by all manner of sounds and noises; because they have not
reasoning power, which is adequate to dispel fear. But thou who hast been
honored with the gift of speech and reason, how is it that thou sinkest to
their ignoble condition? Hath some one entered the city, and announced
the march of soldiers against it? Be not terrified, but leaving him, bend the
knee: call upon thy Lord: groan bitterly, and He will keep off the dreaded
event.

2. Thou hadst heard indeed a false report of the march, and wert in danger
of being severed from the present life. But that blessed Job, when the

messengers came one after another, and he had heard them announcing
their dreadful news. and adding thereto the insupportable destruction of
his children, neither cried nor groaned, but turned to prayer, and gave
thanks to the Lord. Him do thou too imitate; and when any comer
announces that soldiers have encircled the city, and are about to plunder
its wealth, flee to thy Lord and say, "The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken
away; as it seemeth good to the Lord, so is it done. Blessed be the name of
the Lord for ever." The experience of the actual events did not terrify him;
yet the mere report frightens thee. And how are we to be accounted of,
who when we are commanded boldly to encounter death itself, are thus
affrighted by a false rumor! The man who is bewildered constructs fear
which is unreal; and trouble which is not visible; but he who abides in a
settled and tranquil condition of soul, breaks in pieces even that which is
real. Seest thou not pilots; when the sea is raging, and the clouds are
rushing together, and the thunders are bursting forth, and all on board are
in confusion, they seat themselves at the helm without tumult or
disturbance; giving earnest heed to their own art, and considering how they
may ward off the effects of the approaching storm. Be these thy example;
and laying hold of the sacred anchor, the hope that is in God, remain
unshaken and immovable. "Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and
doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house
upon the sand; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it."
Seest thou that it is the character of folly to fall down headlong, and to be
overthrown? Or rather, we were not only reduced to the condition of that
foolish man, but our fall was still more wretched. For the house of that
man fell down after the rivers and rains had descended, and the winds had
beaten upon it; but we, when there were no winds striking, nor floods
invading, nor blasts assaulting, before the experience of disaster, were
overturned by a mere rumor, and dropped at once all the philosophy we
were meditating.

3. What think ye are now my thoughts? How should I conceal, - yea,
bury myself? How must I blush with shame? If I had not been forcibly
urged by our Fathers, I would not have arisen, I would not have spoken,
whilst my mind was darkened with sadness because of your pusillanimity.
But neither now have I been able to recover myself; since anger and sorrow

have laid such siege to my soul. For who would not feel provoked and
indignant, that after so much teaching ye should need the instructions of
Gentiles, that ye might be comforted and persuaded to bear in a manly
way the present alarm. Pray ye therefore that free utterance may be given
us in opening our mouth; and that we may be able to shake off this
sadness, and to hold up again a little; for indeed this shame on account of
your pusillanimity hath greatly depressed our spirits.

4. Lately, I addressed to your Charity many things concerning the snares
lying on all sides of us; and concerning fear and sadness, sorrow and
pleasure; and also concerning the sickle that flieth down upon the houses
of swearers. Now, out of all these many matters, I would have you
especially to remember what I said respecting the "winged sickle," and its
settling in the swearer's house; and pulling down the stones and the wood,
and consuming the whole mass. And withal, take heed to this; that it is the
extreme of folly to swear by taking the Gospels, and to turn the very Law
which forbids swearing into an oath; and that it is better to suffer loss of
property than to impose an oath on our neighbors; since this is a great
honor to be done to God. For when thou sayest to God, "For thy sake I
have not put such a one, who hath robbed and injured me, on his oath,"
God will pay thee back a great recompense on account of this honor, both
here and hereafter. Say these things to others, and observe them also
yourselves. I know that in this place we become more reverent, and lay
aside every evil habit. But what is to be aimed at is, not that we be lovers
of wisdom here only, but that when we depart, we may take this reverence
out with us, where we especially need it. For those who carry water do
not merely have their vessels full when near the fountain, and empty them
when they reach home, but there they put them away with especial
caution, that they may not be overturned, and their labors rendered
useless. Let us all imitate these persons; and when we come home, let us
strictly retain what has been spoken; since if ye here have gotten full, but
return home empty, having the vessels of your understandings destitute of
what ye have heard, there will be no advantage from your replenishment
here. Shew me not the wrestler in the place of exercise, but of actual
contest; and religion not at the season of hearing, but at the season of
practice.

5. Thou applaudest what is said now. When thou art required to swear,
then remember all these things. If ye quickly accomplish this law, we will
advance our teaching to other and greater things. Lo! this is the second
year that I am discoursing to your Charity; and I have not yet been able to
explain a hundred lines of the Scriptures, And the reason is, that ye need
to learn of us what ye might reduce to practice at home, and of yourselves;
and thus the greater part of our exhortation is consumed on ethical
discourse. But this ought not to have been so; the regulation of manners
you ought to have learnt at home, and of yourselves; but the sense of the
Scriptures, and the speculations upon them, you might commit to us. If,
however, it were necessary that you should hear such things of us, there
was no need of more than one day: for what there is to be said is of no
diversified or difficult character, or such as requires any elaboration. For
when God declares His sentence, subtle arguments are unseasonable. God
hath said, "Thou shall not swear." Do not then demand of me the reasons
of this. It is a royal law. He who established it, knows the reason of the
law. If it had not been profitable, He would not have forbidden it. Kings
bring in laws, and not all perchance profitable; for they are men, and
cannot be competent to discover what is useful, like God. Nevertheless,
we obey them. Whether we marry, or make wills, or are about to purchase
servants, or houses, or fields, or to do any other act, we do these things
not according to our own mind, but according to the laws which they
ordain; and we are not entirely at liberty to dispose of the things which
concern ourselves according to our own minds; but in many cases we are
subject to their will; and should we do any thing that is contrary to their
judgment, it becomes invalid and useless. So then tell me, are we to pay so
much respect to the laws of men, and trample under foot the law of God?
What defense, or what pardon can such conduct be worthy of? He hath
said, "Thou shalt not swear." In order that thou mayest do and speak all
things with safety, do not in practice lay down a law contrary to His.

6. But enough of these matters. Let us now proceed to lay before you one
sentence of those which have been read today, and thus end this discourse.
"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ," saith he, "and Timothy the brother."
Great is the designation of Paul: no title of principality and power, but he
speaks of bonds and chains! Truly great indeed! Although many other
things made him illustrious; his being caught up into the third heaven, his

being transported to Paradise, his hearing unutterable words; yet he sets
down none of these, but mentions the chain instead of all, for this made
him more conspicuous and illustrious than these. And why so? Because
the one were the free gifts of the Lord's lovingkindness; and the other the
marks of the constancy and patience of the servant. But it is customary
with those who love, to glory more in the things which they suffer for
those who are beloved, than in the benefits they receive from them. A king
is not so proud of his diadem, as Paul gloried in his chains. And very
justly. For a diadem affords but an ornament to the crowned head; but the
chain is a much greater ornament as well as a security. The kingly crown
often betrays the head it encircles, and allures innumerable traitors, and
invites them to the lust of empire. And in battles this ornament is so
dangerous, that it must be hidden and laid aside. Hence kings in battle,
change the outward dress, and so mingle in the crowd of combatants; so
much betrayal does there result from the crown; but the chain will bring
nothing of this kind upon those who have it, but altogether the contrary;
since if there be a war, and an engagement with demons, and the hostile
powers; the man who is thus encompassed, by holding forth his chain,
repels their assaults. And many of the secular magistrates not only bear
the name of office while they are in authority, but when they have given
up their authority. Such a one is called an ex-consul, such a one an
ex-praetor. But he, instead of all such titles, says, "Paul the prisoner."
And very rightly. For those magisterial offices are no complete evidences
of virtue in respect to the soul; for they are to be purchased by money,
and obtained by the solicitations of friends; but this distinction that is
obtained by bonds is a proof of the soul's love of wisdom, and the
strongest sign of a longing for Christ. And the former are soon gone, but
this distinction has none to succeed to it. Behold at least from that time to
the present day how long a time has passed, and yet the name of this
Prisoner has become increasingly illustrious. As to all the consuls,
whoever they were, of former times, they are passed into silence; and not
even their names are known to the generality of mankind. But the name of
this Prisoner, the blessed Paul, is still great here, great in the land of the
barbarians, great also among the Scythians and Indians; and were you to go
even to the very bounds of the habitable world, you would hear of this
appellation, and whithersoever any one could come, he would perceive
that the name of Paul was born in the mouths of all men. And what marvel

is it, if it be so by land and sea, when even in the heavens the name of Paul
is great; with angels and archangels and the powers above, and with the
King of these, even God! "But what were the chains," says some one,
"that brought glory to him who was thus fettered? Were they not formed
of iron?" Of iron, indeed, they were formed; but they contained the grace
of the Spirit, abundantly flourishing in them; since he wore them for
Christ's sake. Oh, wonder! the servants were bound, the Master was
crucified, and yet the preaching of the Gospel every day increases! And
through the means by which it was supposed that it would be
extinguished, by these very means it was kindled; and the Cross and
bonds, which were thought to be an abomination, these are now become
the symbols of salvation; and that iron was to us more precious than all
gold, not by its intrinsic nature, but for this cause and ground!

7. But here I see an enquiry arising out of this point; and if you give me
your attention, will both state the question exactly, and will add the
solution. What then is the subject of enquiry? This same Paul once having
come before Festus, whilst discoursing to him, and defending himself
concerning the charges which the Jews had alleged against him, and telling
how he had seen Jesus, how he had heard that blessed voice; how he had
been struck with blindness and recovered sight, and had fallen down and
risen up again; how he had come a captive into Damascus, bound without
chains; after speaking likewise of the Law and of the Prophets, and
shewing that they had foretold all these things, he captured the judge, and
almost persuaded him to come over to himself. For such are the souls of
holy men: when they have fallen into dangers, they do not consider how
they may be delivered from dangers, but strive every way how they may
capture their persecutors. Just so did it then happen. He came in to defend
himself, and he departed taking the judge with him! And to this the judge
bore witness, saying, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." And
this ought to have happened today; and this Prefect, on coming among
you, ought to have admired your magnanimity, your fortitude, your
perfect tranquillity; and to have gone away, taking with him a lesson from
your good order, admiring your assembly, praising your congress, and
learning from the actual fact, how great a difference there is between
Gentiles and Christians!

8. But as I was saying: - When Paul had caught him, and he said,
"Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian," Paul answered thus, "I
would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were
both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds." What sayest
thou, O Paul? When thou writest to the Ephesians, thou sayest, "I
therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you, that ye walk worthy of
the vocation wherewith ye are called." And when thou speakest to
Timothy, "Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil-doer, even unto bonds." And
again, when to Philemon, thus; "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ." And
again, when debating with the Jews, thou sayest, "For the hope of Israel I
am bound with this chain." And writing to the Philippians, thou sayest,
"Many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are
much more bold to speak the word without fear." Every where thou
bearest about the chain, everywhere thou puttest forward thy bonds, and
boastest in the thing. But when thou comest to the tribunal, thou betrayest
thy philosophy, where it were right to have spoken the most boldly, and
sayest to the judge, "I would to God that thou mightest become a
Christian ‘without' these bonds!" Yet surely if the bonds were good, and
so good, that they could be the means of making others to grow bold in the
cause of true religion; (for this very thing thou didst declare before, when
thou saidst, "Many of the brethren, waxing confident by my bonds, did
speak the word without fear"); for what reason dost thou not glory in this
thing in the presence of the judge, but doest even the reverse?

9. Does not what I say appear a question? The solution of it, however, I
will bring forward at once. For Paul acted thus, not from distress or fear,
but from an abundance of wisdom and spiritual understanding. And how
this was, I proceed to explain. He was addressing a Gentile, and an
unbeliever, who knew nothing of our matters. Hence he was unwilling to
introduce him by way of disagreeable things, but as he said, "I became to
them that are without law, as without law;" so he acted in the present
instance. His meaning is, "If the Gentile hear of bonds and tribulations, he
will straightway be taking flight; since he knows not the power of bonds.
First, let him become a believer; let him taste of the word preached, and
then he will even of himself hasten towards these bonds. I have heard the
Lord saying, "No man putteth a piece of new cloth into an old garment,
for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is

made worse. Neither do men put new wine into old wine-skins; else the
wine-skins burst." The soul of this man is an old garment: an old
wine-skin. It is not renewed by the faith, nor renovated by the grace of the
Spirit. It is yet weak and earthly. It affects the things of this life. It flutters
eagerly after worldly show. It loves a glory that is present. Should he hear
at once, even from the first, that if he becomes a Christian he will become
immediately a prisoner, and will be encompassed with a chain; feeling
ashamed and indignant, he will recoil from the word preached. Therefore,
saith he, "Except these bonds." Not as deprecating the bonds themselves,
God forbid! But condescending to the other's infirmity; for he himself
loved and welcomed his bonds, even as a woman fond of ornament doth
her jewels of gold. Whence is this apparent? "I rejoice," saith he, "in my
sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of
Christ in my flesh." And again; "Unto you it is given in the behalf of
Christ, not only to believe on Him, but to suffer for His sake." And again;
"And not only so, but we also glory in tribulations." Wherefore, if he
rejoices and glories in this, and calls it a gift of grace, it is manifest that
when he was addressing the judge, he spoke to him as he did, for the
reason assigned. Moreover, also in a different passage, when he happened
to find a necessity for glorying, he shews the very same by saying, "Most
gladly, therefore, will I glory in my infirmities...... in reproaches, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, that the power of Christ may
rest upon me." And again; "If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things
which concern mine infirmities." And elsewhere, comparing himself with
others, and exhibiting to us his superiority in the comparison, he thus
speaks; "Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool), I am more."
And wishing to shew this superiority, he did not say that he had raised the
dead, nor that he had expelled demons, nor that he had cleansed lepers, nor
that he had done any other thing of the sort, but that he had suffered those
innumerable hardships. Hence when he said," I am more," he presently
cites the multitude of his trials; "In stripes, above measure, in deaths oft,
in prisons more frequent..... of the Jews five times received I forty stripes
save one, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day
I have been in the deep;" and all the rest. Thus Paul everywhere glories in
tribulations; and prides himself upon this circumstance exceedingly. And
very justly. For this it is which especially shews the power of Christ, viz.

that the Apostles conquered by such means; by bonds, by tribulations, by
scourgings, and the worst of ills.

10. For these two things Christ had announced, tribulation and remission,
labors and crowns, toils and rewards, things pleasant and sad.
Nevertheless, to the present life he assigns the sorrowful things; but for
the life to come, he has stored up those which are pleasant; at once
shewing that He did not mean to deceive men, and wishing by this
arrangement to diminish the burden of human woes. For the imposter first
holds out the things which are pleasant, and afterwards brings forward
those which are disagreeable. Thus for example: - Kidnappers, when
they intend to steal and carry off little children, do not promise them
blows and stripes, or any other thing of that kind, but offer them cakes,
and sweetmeats, and such like, by which the age of childhood is usually
gratified; in order that, enticed by these things, they may sell their liberty,
and may fall into the utmost peril. Moreover, bird-catchers, and fishermen,
thus entice the prey which they pursue, offering first their usual food, and
such as is agreeable to them, and by this means concealing the snare. So
that this is especially the work of imposters, first to hold out things which
are agreeable, but afterwards to introduce the things which are disagreeable.
But the case is altogether the reverse with those who are really careful and
provident for others. Fathers at least act quite in a contrary manner to
kidnappers. When they send their children to school, they set masters
over them, threaten them with stripes, and encompass them with fear on
all sides. But when they have thus spent the first portion of their lives,
and their habits are formed, they then put them in possession of honor,
and power, and luxury, and all the wealth that is theirs.

11. And thus God has acted. After the manner of provident fathers, and
not after that of kidnappers, He has first involved us in things that are
grievous; handing us over to present tribulation, as it were to
schoolmasters and teachers; in order that being chastened and sobered by
these things, after shewing forth all patience, and learning all right
discipline, we may afterwards, when formed into due habits, inherit the
kingdom of heaven. He first prepares and fits us for the management of the
wealth He is to give, and then puts us into the actual possession of riches.
For if He had not acted thus, the giving of riches would have been no boon,
but a punishment and a vengeance. For even as a son that is senseless and

prodigal, when he has succeeded to a paternal inheritance, is precipitated
headlong by this very thing, having none of the practical wisdom requisite
for the economy of wealth; but if he be intelligent, and gentle, and sober,
and moderate, managing his paternal estate as is befitting, he becomes by
this means more illustrious and distinguished: so must it also necessarily
happen in our case. When we have acquired spiritual understanding, when
we have all attained to "perfect manhood," and the measure of full
stature;" then He puts us in possession of all that He has promised: but
now as little children He chastens us, together with consolation and
soothing. And this is not the only advantage of receiving the tribulation
beforehand, but there is also another, not less than this. For the man who
first of all lives luxuriously, and then has to expect punishment after his
luxurious living, has not even a sense of his present luxury, merely by
reason of the expectation of impending woes; but he who is first in a
sorrowful state, if he is anticipating the enjoyment of good things
afterwards, overlooks present difficulties, in the hope of the good things
which are to come. Not only, then, on account of our security, but also for
our pleasure and consolation hath He ordained that the things which are
grievous should be first; in order that being lightened with the hope of
futurity, we should be rendered insensible to what is present. And this
Paul would shew and make plain, when he said, "Our light affliction,
which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
things which are not seen." He calls tribulation light, not because of the
intrinsic nature of things that are grievous, but because of the expectation
of good things to come. For even as the merchant is indifferent to the labor
that attends navigation, being buoyed up with the hope of a cargo; and as
the boxer bravely sustains the blows on his head, looking to the crown
beyond; so also indeed do we, earnestly gazing towards heaven, and the
good things that are in the heavens, whatever evils come on us, sustain
them all with fortitude, being nerved with the good hope of the things to
come.

12. Therefore let us go home, taking with us this saying; for though it be
simple and short, it nevertheless contains much of the doctrine of spiritual
wisdom. He who is in a state of grief and tribulation, hath a sufficient
consolation; he who lives in luxury and abundance, hath that which may

greatly sober him. For when as thou sittest at the table thou art reminded
of this saying, thou wilt speedily shrink from drunkenness and gluttony;
learning through this sentence, how needful it is for us to be striving; and
thou wilt say with thyself, "Paul lived in bonds and in dungeons, but I in
drunkenness and at a luxurious table! What pardon then shall I obtain?"
This also is a fit saying for women; since those who are fond of ornament,
and expensive dresses, and bind themselves about with gold on every side,
when they remember this chain, will hate, I feel assured, and abominate
that adorning of themselves; and will hasten to such bonds as these. For
those ornaments have often been the cause of manifold evils, and
introduced a thousand quarrels into a family, and have bred envy, and
jealousy, and hatred. But these loosed the sins of the wide world,
affrighted demons, and drove away the devil. With these, while tarrying in
prison, he persuaded the jailor; with these he attracted Agrippa himself;
with these he procured many disciples. Therefore he said, "Wherein I
suffer trouble as an evil-doer unto bonds, but the word of God is not
bound." For just as it is not possible to bind a sunbeam, or to shut it up
within the house, so neither the preaching of the word; and what was
much more, the teacher was bound, and yet the word flew abroad; he
inhabited the prison, and yet his doctrine rapidly winged its way every
where throughout the world!

Knowing these things then, let us not be depressed, when adverse affairs
meet us, but then let us be more strong, then more powerful; "for
tribulation worketh patience." Let us not grieve for the calamities which
befall us, but let us in all things give thanks unto God!

13. We have completed the second week of the fast, but this we should
not consider; for going through the fast does not consist in merely going
through the time, but in going through it with amendment of manners. Let
us consider this; whether we have become more diligent; whether we have
corrected any of our defects; whether we have washed away our sins? It is
common for every one to ask in Lent, how many weeks each has fasted;
and some may be heard saying that they have fasted two, others three, and
others that they have fasted the whole of the weeks. But what advantage
is it, if we have gone through the fast devoid of good works? If another
says, "I have fasted the whole of Lent," do thou say, "I had an enemy, but
I was reconciled; I had a custom of evil-speaking, but I put a stop to it; I

had a custom of swearing, but I have broken through this evil practice." It
is of no advantage to merchants, to have gone over a great extent of ocean,
but to have sailed with a freight and much merchandise. The fast will
profit us nothing, if we pass through it as a mere matter of course, without
any result. If we practice a mere abstinence from meats, when the forty
days are past, the fast is over too. But if we abstain from sins, this still
remains, even when the fast has gone by, and will be from this time a
continual advantage to us; and will here render us no small recompense,
before we attain unto the kingdom of heaven. For as he who is living in
iniquity, even before hell, hath punishment, being stung by his conscience;
so the man who is rich in good works, even before the kingdom, will have
the benefit of exceeding joy, in that he is nourished with blessed hopes.

14. Therefore Christ says, "I will see you again, and your heart shall
rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you." A brief saying, but one
that hath in it much consolation. What then is this, "your joy no man
taketh?" if thou hast money, many are able to take away the joy that
comes of thy wealth; as, for instance, a thief, by digging through the wall; a
servant by carrying off what was entrusted to him; an emperor by
confiscation; and the envious man by contumely. Should you possess
power, there are many who are able to deprive you of the joy of it. For
when the conditions of office are at an end, the conditions of pleasure will
also be ended. And in the exercise of office itself too, there are many
accidents occurring, which by bringing difficulty and care, strike at the root
of thy satisfaction. If thou hast bodily strength, the assaults of disease put
a stop to joy from that source. If thou hast beauty and bloom, the
approach of old age withers it, and takes away that joy. Or if thou
enjoyest a sumptuous table, when evening comes on the joy of the
banquet is at an end; for every thing belonging to this life is liable to
damage, and is unable to afford us a lasting pleasure; but piety and the
virtue of the soul is altogether the reverse of this. If thou hast done an
aims, no one is able to take away this good work. Though an army, or
kings, or myriads of calumniators and conspirators, were to beset thee on
all sides, they could not take away the possession, once deposited in
heaven; but the joy thereof continually abideth; for it is said, "He hath
dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness endureth for ever."
And very justly; for in the storehouses of heaven it is laid up, where no

thief breaks in, nor robber seizes, nor moth devours. If thou pourest out
continued and fervent prayers, no man will be able to spoil thee of the
fruit of them; for this fruit too is rooted in the heavens; it is out of the way
of all injury, and remains beyond mortal reach. If when evil-treated thou
has done a kind action; if thou hast born with patience to hear thyself evil
spoken of; if thou hast returned blessings for reproaches; these are good
works that abide continually, and the joy of them no man taketh away; but
as often as thou rememberest these, thou art glad and rejoicest, and reapest
large fruits of pleasure. So also, indeed, if we succeed in avoiding oaths;
and persuade our tongue to abstain from this pernicious practice, the good
work will be finished in a short time, but the delight arising from it will be
continuous and unfailing.

17. And now, it is time that you should be teachers and guides of others;
that friends should undertake to instruct and lead on their neighbors;
servants their fellow-servants; and youths those of their own age. What if
any one had promised thee a single piece of gold for every man who was
reformed, wouldest thou not then have used every exertion, and been all
day long sitting by them, persuading and exhorting. Yet now God
promises thee not one piece of gold, nor ten, or twenty, or a hundred, or a
thousand; no, nor the whole earth, for thy labors, but He gives thee that
which is greater than all the world, the kingdom of heaven; and not only
this, but also another thing besides it. And what kind of thing is that? "He
who taketh forth the precious from the vile," saith He, "shall be as my
mouth." What can be equal to this in point of honor or security? What
kind of excuse or pardon can be left to those, who after so great a promise
neglect their neighbor's safety? Now if you see a blind man falling into a
pit, you stretch forth a hand, and think it a disgraceful thing to overlook
one who is about to perish? But daily beholding all thy brethren
precipitated into the wicked custom of oaths, dost thou not dare even to
utter a word? Thou hast spoken once, perhaps, and he hath not heard.
Speak therefore twice, and thrice, and as often as it may be, till thou hast
persuaded him. Every day God is addressing us, and we do not hear; and
yet He does not leave off speaking. Do thou, therefore, imitate this tender
care towards thy neighbor. For this reason it is that we are placed with one
another; that we inhabit cities, and that we meet together in churches, in
order that we may bear one another's burdens, that we may correct one

another's sins. And in the same manner as persons inhabiting the same
shop, carry on a separate traffic, yet put all afterwards into the common
fund, so also let us act. Whatever advantages each man is able to confer
upon his neighbor, let him not grudge, nor shrink from doing it, but let
there be some such kind of spiritual commerce, and reciprocity; in order
that having deposited every thing in the common store, and obtained great
riches, and procured a large treasure, we may be all together partakers of
the kingdom of heaven; through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by Whom and with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy
Ghost, be glory, both now and ever, and world without end. Amen.

HOMILY 17

Of the Commissioners(Hellebichus Commander of the Troops, and
Caesarius Master of the Offices) sent by the Emperor Theodosius
for the inquisition of the offenders, on account of the overturning of
the Statues.

1. M OST opportunely have we all this day sung together, "Blessed be the
Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. For marvelous, and
beyond all expectation, are the things which have happened? A whole city,
and so great a population, when just about to be overwhelmed - to sink
under the waves, and to be utterly and instantly destroyed - He hath
entirely rescued from shipwreck in a single moment of time! Let us give
thanks then, not only that God hath calmed the tempest, but that He
suffered it to take place; not only that He rescued us from shipwreck, but
that He allowed us to fall into such distress; and such an extreme peril to
hang over us. Thus also Paul bids us "in every thing give thanks." But
when he says, "In every thing give thanks," he means not only in our
deliverance from evils, but also at the time when we suffer those evils.
"For all things work together for good to them that love God." Let us be
thankful to Him for this deliverance from trials; and let us never forget
them. Let us devote ourselves to prayer, to continual supplications, and to
much piety.

2. When the sad conflagration of these calamities was first kindled, I said,
that it was a season not for doctrine, but for prayer. The very same thing I
now repeat, when the fire has been extinguished - that it is now
especially, and more than before, a time for prayer; that now is the season
especially for tears and compunction, for an anxious soul, for much
diligence, and for much caution. For at that time the very nature of our
tribulation restrained us, however unwillingly, and disposed us to
sobriety; and led us to become more religious; but now when the bridle is
removed, and the cloud has passed away, there is fear lest we should fall
back again into sloth, or become relaxed by this respite; and lest one
should have reason to say of us too, "When He slew them, then they
sought Him, and returned, and enquired early after God." Wherefore also
Moses admonished the Jews, saying, "When thou shalt have eaten, and

drunk, and art full, remember the Lord thy God." The goodness of your
disposition will now be rendered manifest, if you continue in the practice
of the same piety. For at that time, many imputed your earnestness to
fear, and the approach of calamity; but now, it will be purely your own
achievement, if you still persevere in maintaining this earnestness. Since
with a boy too, as long as he is guided by some tutor whom he fears, if he
lives with sobriety and meekness, there is nothing to admire, for all
persons ascribe the sobriety of the stripling to his fear of the tutor. But
when he remains in the same seemly behavior, after the restraint from that
quarter is done away with, all persons give him credit too for the sobriety
that was seen in his earlier age. Thus also let us act; let us continue in the
same state of godly fear, in order that for our former diligence too we may
gain much praise from God.

3. We had expected innumerable woes; that our property would be
plundered, that the houses would have been burnt together with their
inmates, that the city would have been plucked up from the midst of the
world, that its very fragments would have been utterly destroyed, and that
its soil would have been placed under the plough! But, lo! all these things
existed only in expectation, and did not come into operation. And this is
not the only wonder, that God hath removed so great a danger, but that He
hath also greatly blessed us, and adorned our city; and by this trial and
calamity hath made us more approved! But how, I will state. When those
who were sent by the Emperor erected that fearful tribunal for making
inquisition into the events which had taken place, and summoned every
one to give account of the deeds which they had perpetrated, and various
anticipations of death pervaded the minds of all, then the monks who
dwelt on the mountain-tops shewed their own true philosophy. For
although they had been shut up so many years in their cells, yet at no
one's entreaty, by no one's counsel, when they beheld such a cloud
overhanging the city, they left their caves and huts, and flocked together in
every direction, as if they had been so many angels arriving from heaven.
Then might one see the city likened to heaven, while these saints appeared
everywhere; by their mere aspect consoling the mourners, and leading
them to an utter disregard of the calamity. For who on beholding these
would not deride death, would not despise life. And not only was this
wonderful, but that when they drew nigh to the magistrates themselves,

they spoke to them with boldness on behalf of the accused, and were all
ready to shed their blood, and to lay down their heads, so that they might
snatch the captured from the terrible events which they expected. They
also declared that they would not depart until the judges should spare the
population of the city, or send them themselves together with the accused
to the Emperor. "He," said they, "who rules over our portion of the world
is a godly man, a believer, one who lives in the practice of piety. We
therefore shall assuredly reconcile him. We will not give you leave, nor
permit you to embrue the sword, or take off a head. But if ye do not
desist, we also are quite resolved to die with them. We confess that the
crimes committed are very heinous; but the iniquity of those deeds does
not surpass the humanity of the Emperor." One of them is also reported
to have uttered another saying, full of wisdom, to this effect: "The Statues
which have been thrown down are again set up, and have resumed their
proper appearance; and the mischief was speedily rectified; but if ye put
to death the image of God, how will ye be again able to revoke the deed! or
how to reanimate those who are deprived of life, and to restore their souls
to their bodies?" Many things too they said to them of the Judgment.

4. Who could but be astonished? Who could but admire the moral wisdom
of these men? When the mother of one of the accused, uncovering her
head, and exposing her gray hairs, laid hold of the horse of the judge by the
bridle, and running beside him through the forum, thus entered with him
the place of justice, we were all struck with astonishment, we all admired
that exceeding tenderness and magnanimity. Ought we not, then, to have
been much more impressed with wonder at the conduct of these men? For
if she had even died for her son, it would have been nothing strange, since
great is the tyranny of nature, and irresistible is the obligation arising from
the maternal pangs! But these men so loved those whom they had not
begotten, whom they had not brought up, yea rather, whom they had
never seen, whom they had not heard of, whom they had never met, whom
they knew only from their calamity, that if they had possessed a thousand
lives, they would have chosen to deliver them all up for their safety. Tell
me not that they were not slaughtered, that they did not pour forth their
blood, but that they used as much boldness with their judges as it was
likely that no other men would do, but such as had already renounced their
own lives; and that with this sentiment they ran from the mountains to the

tribunal. For, indeed, if they had not before prepared themselves against
every sort of slaughter, they would not have been able to speak thus freely
to the judges, or to have manifested such magnanimity. For they remained
all day long sitting before the doors of the place of justice, being prepared
to snatch from the hands of the executioners those who were about to be
led off to punishment!

5. Where now are those who are clad in threadbare cloaks, and display a
long beard, and carry staves in the right hand; the philosophers of the
world, who are more abject in disposition than the dogs under the table;
and do every thing for the sake of the belly? All these men then forsook
the city, they all hasted away, and hid themselves in caves! But they only,
who truly by works manifest the love of wisdom, appeared as fearlessly
in the forum, as if no evil had overtaken the city. And the inhabitants of
the city fled away to the mountains and to the deserts, but the citizens of
the desert hastened into the city; demonstrating by deeds what, on the
preceding days, I have not desisted from saying, that the very furnace will
not be able to harm the man who leads a virtuous life. Such a thing is
philosophy of soul, rising superior to all things, and to all prosperous or
adverse events; for neither is it enfeebled by the former, nor beaten down
and debased by the latter, but abides on the same level through the whole
course of things, shewing its own native force and power! Who, indeed,
was not convicted of weakness by the difficulty of the present crisis?
Those who had held the first offices in our city, who were in places of
power, who were surrounded with immense wealth, and who were in high
favor with the Emperor, leaving their houses utterly deserted, all consulted
their own safety, and all friendship and kindred were found worthless, and
those whom they formerly knew, at this season of calamity, they desired
not to know, and prayed to be unknown of them! But the monks, poor as
they were, having nothing more than a mean garment, who had lived in the
coarsest manner, who seemed formerly to be nobodies, men habituated to
mountains and forests; as if they had been so many lions, with a great and
lofty soul, whilst all were fearing and quaking, stood forth and relieved the
danger, and that, not in the course of many days, but in a brief moment of
time! And as distinguished warriors without coming into close conflict
with their adversaries, but merely by making their appearance in the ranks,
and shouting, put the foe to rout, so also these in one day descended, and

said their say, and removed the calamity, and returned to their own
tabernacles. So great is the moral wisdom that was brought among men by
Christ.

6. And why do I speak of the rich, and of those in authority? When those
very persons who had been invested with power to judge the criminals;
who acted with the highest authority, were entreated by these selfsame
monks to grant a sentence of pardon, they said, they had no power over
the result; for that it was unsafe and dangerous, not only to insult the
Emperor, but even to dismiss those who had insulted him, when taken,
without punishment. But these men were too powerful for any one to
resist; and besieging them by magnanimity and perseverance, they induced
these officers by their importunity to exercise a power which they had not
received from the Emperor; and even succeeded in persuading the judges,
when men had been manifestly convicted of the guilt, not to declare the
sentence of condemnation, but to defer the final result to the decision of
the Emperor; and they promised certainly to persuade him to grant a
pardon to those who had transgressed against him; and they were about to
set out on a journey to him. But the judges, reverencing the moral wisdom
of these men, and being struck with their loftiness of spirit, did not permit
them to undertake this long journey, but promised that if they should only
receive their words in writing, they would themselves depart and
successfully importune the Emperor to dismiss all anger (which, indeed,
we are now expecting that he will). For when sentence should have been
given, they, on being admitted into court, uttered words of the highest
wisdom, and besought the Emperor by letters to shew mercy; and they
reminded him of the Judgment, and said that they would lay down their
own heads, if his mercy was not granted. And the judges took down these
words in writing, and departed. This, more than the brightest crown, will
adorn our city. And what has here taken place, the Emperor will now hear;
yea, the great City will hear, and the whole world will hear, that the monks
who dwell at the city of Antioch, are men who have displayed an
apostolic boldness; and now when their letters are read at court, all men
will admire their magnanimity; all men will call our city blessed; and we
shall shake off our evil reputation; and it will be known every where, that
what has happened was not the work of the inhabitants of the city, but of

strangers and corrupt-minded men; and that this testimony of the monks
will be a sufficient evidence of the character of the city.

7. Therefore, beloved, let us not be distressed, but let us entertain
favorable hopes; for if their boldness toward men has been able to prevent
such a danger, then what will not their boldness toward God effect? These
things also let us tell the Greeks, when they dare to dispute with us
respecting their philosophers! From hence it is manifest that their stories
of former days are false, but that the things of old reported among us are
true; that is, the things concerning John, and Paul, and Peter, and all the
rest. For inasmuch as these monks have succeeded to the piety of those
men, they have consequently exhibited their boldness. Inasmuch as they
were brought up in the same laws, they have consequently imitated their
virtues. So that we stand in no need of writings for the purpose of shewing
the apostolical virtues, whilst the very facts cry aloud, and the masters are
shewn forth by the scholars. We have no need of disputation to display
the trifling of the Greeks, and the little-mindedness of their philosophers,
whilst their deeds now loudly proclaim, as they did aforetime, that all with
them is a fable, a stage-play, a piece of acting.

8. And the same magnanimity was displayed by the priests too, as well as
the monks, and they shared among them the charge of our safety. One of
them, indeed, proceeded to court, esteeming all things as secondary to the
love of you; and being himself ready, if he could not persuade the
Emperor, to lay down his own life. And these, who remained here, have
displayed the same virtues as the monks themselves; and holding fast the
judges with their own hands, they would not let them enter into the court,
before they gave a promise respecting the result of the trial. And when
they saw them making signs of refusal, they again exerted themselves with
much boldness; and as soon as they saw that they did consent, embracing
their feet and knees, and kissing their hands, they gave an exceeding proof
of either virtue, of liberty and meekness. For that theirs was not the
boldness of presumption, they plainly signified by their kissing the knees,
and embracing the feet of the judges. Again, in proof that this was not
flattery, nor a kind of fawning servility, nor the fruit of a slavish spirit,
their former acts attested their boldness. And these are not the only good
results we have reaped from the trial, but also an abundance of sobriety
and meekness; and our city has become all at once a monastery. Not thus

would any one have adorned it, had he erected golden statues in the forum,
as it has now been adorned and distinguished, in producing those beautiful
images of virtue, and displaying its true riches!

9. But it may be that the things which the Emperor hath decreed are
painful. No! not even these are really burdensome, but have brought much
advantage with them. For what is there, I ask, which is oppressive in any
of them? that the Emperor hath shut up the Orchestra, that he hath
forbidden the Hippodrome, that he hath closed and stopped up these
fountains of iniquity. May they never again be opened! From thence did
the roots of wickedness shoot forth to the injury of the city! From thence
sprung those who blast its character; men who sell their voices to the
dancers, and who for the sake of three obols prostitute their salvation to
them, turning all things upside down! Art thou distressed, O beloved! for
these things? Truly it were fitting that for these thou shouldest be glad,
and rejoice, and express thy thanks to the Emperor, since his castigation
hath proved a correction, his punishment a discipline, his wrath a means of
instruction! But that the Baths are shut up? Neither is this an intolerable
hardship, that those who lead a soft, effeminate, and dissolute life, should
be brought back, though unwillingly, to the love of true wisdom.

10. But is it complained of, that the Emperor hath taken away the dignity
of the city, and hath no more permitted it to be called a metropolis? But
what was he to do? Could he praise what had been done, and acknowledge
it as a favor? Then who would not have blamed him, for not shewing even
the outward form of indignation? Seest thou not that fathers do many
things of a similar nature towards their children? They turn away from
them, and forbid them the table. This also hath the Emperor done by
imposing such punishments as have nothing in them hurtful, but carry
with them much correction. Think what we expected, and what has taken
place, and then we shall especially discern the favor of God! Dost thou
grieve that the dignity of the city is taken away? Learn what the dignity of
a city is; and then thou wilt know clearly, that if the inhabitants do not
betray it, no one else will be able to take away the dignity of a city! Not
the fact that it is a metropolis; nor that it contains large and beautiful
buildings; nor that it has many columns, and spacious porticoes and walks,
nor that it is named in proclamations before other cities, but the virtue and
piety of its inhabitants; this is a city's dignity, and ornament, and defense;

since if these things are not found in it, it is the most insignificant in the
world, though it may enjoy unlimited honor from Emperors! Dost thou
wish to learn the dignity of thy city? Dost thou wish to know its
ancestry? I will tell it exactly; not only that thou mayest know, but that
thou mayest also emulate. What then is after all the dignity of this city of
ours? "It came to pass, that the disciples were first called Christians at
Antioch." This dignity, none of the cities throughout the world possesses,
not even the city of Romulus herself! For this it can look the whole world
in the face; on account of that love toward Christ, that boldness and virtue.
Dost thou wish farther to hear of a different dignity and commendation
belonging to this city? A grievous famine was once approaching, and the
inhabitants of Antioch determined, as far as each person had the means, to
send relief to the Saints dwelling at Jerusalem. Behold a second dignity,
charity in a time of famine! The season did not make them niggardly, nor
the expectation of the calamity backward in helping; but when all are apt
to be scraping up what is not their own, then they distributed their own,
not merely to those who were near, but also to those who were living afar
off! Seest thou here the faith towards God, and the love towards their
neighbor? Wouldest thou learn another dignity of this city? Certain men
came down from Judaea to Antioch, defiling the doctrine preached, and
introducing Jewish observances. The men of Antioch did not bear this
novelty in silence. They did not hold their peace, but having come
together, and made an assembly, they sent Paul and Barnabas to
Jerusalem, and caused the Apostles to provide that pure doctrines, cleared
from all Jewish imperfection, might be distributed throughout all parts of
the world! This is the dignity of the city! this is its precedence! this makes
it a metropolis, not in the earth, but in heaven; forasmuch as that all other
honors are corruptible, and fleeting, and perish with the present life, and
often come to their end before the close of it, as they have done in the
present instance! To me, a city that hath not pious citizens is meaner than
any village, and more ignoble than any cave.

11. And why do I speak of a city? For that thou mayest exactly
understand that virtue alone is the ornament of the inhabitants, I will not
speak to thee of a city, but I will endeavor to demonstrate this by bringing
forward what is more venerable than any city - the Temple of God
which was in Jerusalem. For this was the Temple in which were sacrifices

and prayers and services; where was the Holy of Holies, and the
Cherubim, the Covenant, and the golden pot; the great symbols of God's
providence towards that people; where oracles from heaven were
constantly being received, where prophets became inspired, where the
fashioning was not the work of human art, but proceeded from the wisdom
of God, where the walls were on every side resplendent with much gold,
and where, in surpassing excellence, costliness of material and perfection
of art met together, and demonstrated that there was no other temple like
this upon earth! Yea rather, not only the perfection of art, but also the
wisdom of God assisted in that building. For Solomon had learned all, not
intuitively and from himself, but from God; and having received the design
of it from the heavens, he then marked it out and erected it. Nevertheless,
this Temple, thus beautiful and marvelous and sacred, when those who
used it were corrupted, was so dishonored, despised, and profaned, that
even before the captivity it was called "a den of robbers, a cave of
hyenas;" and afterwards it was delivered over to hands that were
barbarous, polluted, and profane!

12. Wouldest thou learn the same truth respecting cities? What could be
more illustrious than the cities of Sodom? For the houses and the buildings
were splendid, and so were their walls; and the country was fat and fertile,
and" like the Paradise of God." But the tent of Abraham was mean and
small, and had no fortification. Yet when a foreign war took place, the
strangers broke down and took the walled cities, and departed, carrying
away their inhabitants captives. Abraham, however, the citizen of the
desert, they could not resist when he attacked them! And so it was likely
to be. For he had true piety: a power much greater than numbers and the
defense of walls. If thou art a Christian, no earthly city is thine. Of our
City "the Builder and Maker is God." Though we may gain possession of
the whole world, we are withal but strangers and sojourners in it all! We
are enrolled in heaven: our citizenship is there! Let us not, after the manner
of little children, despise things that are great, and admire those which are
little! Not our city's greatness, but virtue of soul is our ornament and
defense. If you suppose dignity to belong to a city, think how many
persons must partake in this dignity, who are whoremongers, effeminate,
depraved and full of ten thousand evil things, and at last despise such

honor! But that City above is not of this kind; for it is impossible that he
can be a partaker of it, who has not exhibited every virtue.

13. Let us not therefore be senseless; but then let us grieve when any one
deprives us of our dignity of soul, when we commit sin, when we have
offended the common Lord of all; since as regards the things that have now
befallen us, so far are they from injuring the city, that if we are watchful,
they will greatly benefit us. For even already our city seems to be like a
decorous, noble, sober-minded matron. Fear hath made her gentler and
more dignified, and hath delivered her from those miscreants who were
concerned in the late audacious deeds. Let us therefore not give way to
womanish lamentations. For I have heard many about the forum saying,
"Alas! for thee, Antioch! What hath befallen thee! How art thou
dishonored!" Truly when I heard, I smiled at the puerile mind which could
give vent to these words! Such words were not becoming now; but when
thou seest men dancing, drunken, singing, blaspheming, swearing, perjuring
themselves, and lying, then apply such a saying as this: "Alas! for thee, O
city, what hath befallen thee!" But if thou seest the forum containing a few
meek, modest, and temperate persons, then pronounce the city,
"Blessed!" For the fewness will never be able to injure it in any respect, if
there be virtue withal; as on the other hand, numbers will never profit it at
all, whilst iniquity is there. "If," saith the prophet, "the number of the
sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;" that is
to say, "Multitude will never prevail with Me." So also Christ spoke. He
called cities wretched; not because of their littleness, nor because they
were not of metropolitan rank. And Jerusalem itself again, He calls
wretched for the very same reason, speaking thus; "O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem; thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent
unto thee!" For what advantage, I ask, does a multitude bring, if their
system of living be vicious? Nay, on the contrary, even injury results from
it. What else, indeed, hath wrought the evils which have lately sprung up?
Was it not the sloth, the recklessness, and the depravity of the
inhabitants? Did the dignity of the city, did the magnificence of its
architecture, or the circumstance that it was a metropolis, do it any
service? If with the king who is on earth, nothing could protect it when it
had done thus amiss, but all these privileges are taken away; much more
with the Lord of angels will its dignity fail to protect it? For at that Day, it

will nought avail us, that we have dwelt in a metropolis, that has many
spacious porticoes, and other dignities of this kind! And why do I say, at
That Day? For as regards the present life, what can it benefit thee that this
thy city is a metropolis? Pray, has any one restored a distressed family by
means of this? or received any revenue from this dignity? or dispelled
sadness? or got rid of any bodily infirmity? or put away a vice of the soul?
Beloved! let us not trifle, nor regard the opinions of the multitude, but
understand what is indeed the dignity of a city; what it is that makes a city
truly a metropolis?

14. I say all this, though I expect that the city will again regain even this
outward distinction, and appear in its own proper place of precedence.
For the Emperor is both philanthropic and godly. But I am desirous that if
it should be restored, ye may not think too much of this; nor be boastful
of it; nor place the honor of our city to that account. When you wish to
pronounce an encomium on the city, tell me not of the suburb of Daphne,
nor of the height and multitude of its cypresses, nor of its fountains of
waters, nor of the great population who inhabit the city, nor of the great
freedom with which its market-place is frequented even to midnight, nor of
the abundance of its wares! All these are things of the outward sense, and
remain only as long as the present life. But if you are able to mention
virtue, meekness, alms-giving, nocturnal vigils, prayers, sobriety, true
wisdom of soul; commend the city for these things! To those who inhabit
the desert, the presence of these things makes it more illustrious than any
city; and again the vilest of all places, should these things not be found
with its citizens. Let us make this estimate not in the case of cities only,
but also of men. And if you see a big man, who has been brought into good
condition, tall, and surpassing others in length of limb, do not admire him,
until you have ascertained what the man's soul is. Not from the outward
comeliness, but from the beauty that. appertains to the soul, should we
pronounce any persons blessed! David was little, and short of stature;
nevertheless, one so short and little, and bare of all arms, brought down at
one blow so large an army, and treat tower of flesh; and this without
hurling spear, or letting fly arrow, or unsheathing sword, but doing all with
a small pebble! For this reason a certain one exhorts, saying," Commend
not a man for his beauty, neither abhor a man for his outward appearance.

The bee is little among such as fly, but her fruit is the chief of sweet
things."

15. Thus also let us speak both of a city, and of men, and utter such
wisdom one to an other, and be continually thankful to God, as well for
present as for past mercies; and call upon Him in common with all our
might, that those who now dwell in prison may be discharged, and that
those who are about to be sent into exile may return back again. They too
are our members. With us they have buffetted the waves, with us they
have withstood the storm! Let us, then, beseech the merciful God, that
with us they may enjoy the calm! Let no one say, "What farther concerns
me? I am freed from danger; such an one may perish; such another may be
destroyed!" Let us not provoke God by this indifference; but lament, as if
we ourselves were in the same peril. So let us supplicate God with intense
earnestness, fulfilling that saying of Paul, "Remember them that are in
bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being
yourselves also in the body. Weeping also with them that weep;
condescending to men of low estate." This will also be of the greatest
advantage to ourselves; for nothing useth so much to delight God, as that
we should be very ready to mourn for our own members. Him therefore let
us supplicate in common, both for things present, and for things to come;
in order that He may deliver us from punishment hereafter. For the things
present, whatever they are, are endurable, and have an end; but the
torments there are immortal, and interminable! And while we are consoled,
let us also ourselves endeavor to fall no more into such sins, knowing that
hereafter we shall enjoy no pardon! Let us, then, all in common prostrate
ourselves before God; and both while we are here, and when we are at
home, let us say, "Thou, O Lord, art righteous in all things which Thou
hast done towards us; for Thou hast brought upon us by a just judgment
whatever Thou hast brought." If "our sins rise up against us, undertake for
us, for thy Name's sake;" and do not permit us any more to experience
such grievous troubles. "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil, for Thine is the kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever.
Amen.

HOMILY 18

The former subject of the Sedition continued; also of fasting; and
upon the Apostolic saying, "Rejoice in the Lord always."

1. I HAVE observed many persons rejoicing, and saying one to another,
"We have conquered; we have prevailed; the half of the fast is spent." But
I exhort such persons not to rejoice on this account, that the half of the
fast is gone, but to consider whether the half of their sins be gone; and if
so, then to exult. For this is a fit subject of gratification. This is what is to
be sought after, and for which all things are done, that we may correct our
defects; and that we may not quit the fast the same persons as we entered
upon it, but in a cleansed state; and that having laid aside all that belongs
to evil habits, we may thus keep the sacred feast, since if the case be
otherwise, we shall be so far from obtaining any advantage, that the
completion of the fast will be the greatest injury to us. Let us, therefore,
not rejoice that we have gone through the length of the fast, for this is
nothing great; but let us rejoice, if we have got through it with fresh
attainments, so that when this is over, the fruit of it may shine forth. For
the gain of winter is more especially manifested after the season is gone
by. Then, the flourishing corn, and the trees teeming with leaves and fruit,
proclaim, by their appearance, the benefit that has accrued to them from
the winter Let the same thing also take place with us. For during the
winter, we have enjoyed divers and frequent showers, having been during
the fast partakers of a continued course of instruction, and have received
spiritual seeds, and cut away the thorns of luxury.

2. Wherefore let us persevere, retaining with all diligence what we have
heard; that when the fast is over, the fruit of the fast may abound, and that
by the good things we gathered from the fast, we may remember the fast
itself. If thus we fashion ourselves, we shall, when the fast returns,
welcome it again with pleasure. For I see many who are so feeble-minded,
that at the present season they are anxious about the following Lent; and I
have heard many saying, that after their liberation from the fast, they are
insensible to any pleasure from this remission, on account of their anxiety
about the coming year. What can be more feeble-minded than this? I ask;
and what is the cause of this? It is, that when the fast is arrived, we do not

take pains that the concerns of the soul may be well ordered, but we limit
the fast solely to an abstinence from food. Since, were we to reap the full
benefit of it in a reformation of conduct, we should wish the fast to come
round every day, receiving in very deed an experience of its good effects;
and we should never cast away the desire of it, or be dejected and anxious
whilst expecting it.

3. For there is nothing whatever that will be able to afflict one who is well
ordered in mind, and careful about his own soul; but he will enjoy a pure
and continued pleasure. And that this is true ye have today heard from
Paul, who exhorts us, saying, "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say,
rejoice." I know indeed that to many this saying seems impossible. "For
how is it possible," says some one, "that he who is but a man, can
continually rejoice? To rejoice is no hard matter, but to rejoice continually,
this seems to me to be impossible." For many are the causes of sadness,
which surround us on all sides. A man has lost either a son, or a wife, or a
beloved friend, more necessary to him than all kindred; or he has to sustain
the loss of wealth; or he has fallen into sickness; or he has to bear some
other change of fortune; or to grieve for contemptuous treatment which he
did not deserve; or famine, or pestilence, or some intolerable exaction, or
circumstances in his family trouble him; - nay, there is no saying how
many circumstances of a public or private nature are accustomed to
occasion us grief. How then, he may say, is it possible to "rejoice
always?" Yea, Oman! it is possible; and if it were not so, Paul would not
have given the exhortation; nor would a man endowed with spiritual
wisdom have offered such counsel; and for this reason I have constantly
said to you, and will not cease to say, that what ye could no where have
learnt from any other, that wisdom ye may here meditate. For mankind are
universally desirous of pleasure, and of rejoicing; and for this, they do all,
say all, and undertake all things. Therefore it is, that the merchant goes on
a voyage, in order that he may amass wealth; and he amasses wealth, to
the end that he may rejoice over what he has treasured up. The soldier also
for this reason exercises his warfare, and the husbandman his husbandry;
for this each man plies his art. Those also who love dominion, love it for
this end, that they may obtain glory; and they desire to obtain glory, that
they may rejoice; and any one may perceive that each of our undertakings

is directed to this point, and that every man looking to this makes haste to
go towards it through a variety of means.

4. For as I said, all love gladness, but all are not able to attain it, since they
know not the way which leads to it; but many suppose that the source of
it is in being rich. But if this were its source, no one possessed of wealth
would ever be sad. But in fact many of the rich think life not worth living,
and would infinitely prefer death when they experience any hardship; and
of all men these are the most liable to excessive sadness. For you should
not look to their tables, or their flatterers, and parasites, but to the trouble
that comes of such things, the insults, the calumnies, the dangers, and the
distresses, and what is far worse, that they meet these reverses
unpracticed, and know not how to take them philosophically, or to bear
with fortitude what befalls them; whence it happens that calamities do not
appear to them such as they are in their own nature, but even things which
are really light come to seem intolerable; whereas, with regard to the poor,
the contrary takes place; things that are irremediable seem easy to be born,
since they are familiar with many such. For it is not so much the nature of
the events as the disposition of the sufferers, that makes the evils which
come upon us seem great or small. And that I may not go a long way off
for examples of both these facts, I will speak to you of what has lately
befallen ourselves. Behold then how all the poor escaped, and the
populace are delivered from the danger, and enjoy an entire freedom! but
those who manage the affairs of the city, the men who keep their studs of
horses, and preside over the public games, and such as have born other
public charges, they are now the inmates of the prison, and fear the worst;
and they alone pay the penalty of the deeds that have been perpetrated by
all, and are in a state of constant terror; and they are now the most
wretched of men, not because of the greatness of the danger, but on
account of the luxury in which hitherto they have lived! Many, at least
when exhorted by us, and counseled to sustain these adverse affairs with
fortitude, said this, "We never practiced any thing of the kind, and do not
know how to exercise such philosophy; this is why we need so much
consolation."

5. Others again suppose, that to enjoy good health is the source of
pleasure. But it is not so. For many of those who enjoy good health have a
thousand times wished themselves dead, not being able to bear the insults

inflicted on them. Others again affirm, that to enjoy glory, and to have
attained to power, and to administer the highest offices, and to be flattered
by multitudes, is productive of continual gladness. But neither is this the
case. And why do I speak of other offices of power? For although we
were to mount up in thought to royalty itself, and to him who lives in that
station, we should find it encompassed with a diversity of troubles, and
having so many necessary causes the more of sadness, in proportion as it
is surrounded with a greater weight of affairs. And what need is there to
speak of wars, and battles, and the insurrections of barbarians? Oftentimes
he has reason to fear those by whom he is surrounded at home. For many
of those monarchs who have escaped from the hands of their enemies,
have not escaped the conspiracies of their own body-guards. And kings
have of necessity as many causes of sadness as there are waves on the
ocean. But if monarchy is unable to render life devoid of grief, then what
else can possibly achieve this? Nothing, indeed, of this life; but this saying
of Paul alone, brief and simple as it is, will of itself open to us this
treasure.

6. For many words are not needed, nor a long round of argument, but if we
only consider his expression, we shall find the way that leads to it. He
does not simply say, "Rejoice always;" but he adds the cause of the
continual pleasure, saying, "Rejoice in the Lord always." He who rejoices
"in the Lord," can not be deprived of the pleasure by any thing that may
happen. For all other things in which we rejoice are mutable and
changeable, and subject to variation. And not only does this grievous
circumstance attend them, but moreover while they remain they do not
afford us a pleasure sufficient to repel and veil the sadness that comes
upon us from other quarters. But the fear of God contains both these
requisites. It is steadfast and immovable, and sheds so much gladness that
we can admit no sense of other evils. For the man who fears God as he
ought, and trusts in Him, gathers from the very root of pleasure, and has
possession of the whole fountain of cheerfulness. And as a spark falling
upon a wide ocean quickly disappears, so whatever events happen to the
man who fears God, these, falling as it were upon an immense ocean of
joy, are quenched and destroyed! This indeed is most to be wondered at,
that whilst things which minister sadness are present, the man should
remain joyful. For if there was nothing to produce grief, it would be no

great matter to him that he was able continually to rejoice. But that at a
time when he is urged to sadness by the pressure of many things, he is
superior to all these, and is blithe in the midst of sorrow. this is truly a
matter for astonishment! And as no one would have wondered that the
three Children were not burnt, if they had remained far off from the
furnace of Babylon! (for the circumstance that astonished all was, that
having been so long in such close contact with the fire, they left it more
free from hurt than those who had not been in contact with it); so also we
are able to say of the saints, that if no temptation had fastened itself upon
them, we should not have wondered at their continual rejoicing. But the
point worthy of admiration, and that which surpasses human nature, is
this, that being encircled on all sides with innumerable waves, their
condition is easier than that of those who enjoy an entire calm!

7. From what has been said, it is evident that amongst those who are
outside the church it is impossible to find any situation in life, encircled
with continual gladness from the things without. But that the believer
cannot possibly be deprived of the enjoyment of a continued pleasure is
what I will now proceed to prove, to the end that ye may not only learn,
but also emulate this painless condition of life. For suppose a man having
nothing for which to condemn himself, but cherishing a good conscience,
and yearning after the future state, and the fulfillment of those good hopes;
what, I ask, will be able to throw such a person into sadness? Does not
death seem the most insupportable of all things? Yet the expectation of
this is so far from grieving him, that it makes him the more joyful; for he
knows that the arrival of death is a release from labor, and a speeding
toward the crowns and rewards laid up for those who have contended in
the race of piety and virtue. But is it the untimely end of his children?
Nay, he will also bear this nobly, and will take up the words of Job, "The
Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it seemed good unto the Lord, so
is it come to pass. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever." But if death
and loss of children cannot grieve, much less can the loss of money, or
dishonor, or reproaches, or false accusations, at any time affect a soul so
great and noble; no, nor anguish of body, since the Apostles were
scourged, yet they were not made sad. This, indeed, was a great thing; but
what is much more, instead of being made sad, they considered their very
scourgings, as a ground of additional pleasure. "And they departed from

the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to
suffer shame for the name of Christ." Did any person insult and revile
such a one? Well, he was taught by Christ to rejoice in these revilings.
"Rejoice," saith He, "and be exceeding glad, when they shall say all manner
of evil against you falsely for my sake; for great is your reward in heaven."
But suppose a man hath fallen into disease? Well, he hath heard another
admonishing, and saying, "In disease and poverty trust thou in Him; for as
gold is tried in the fire, so are acceptable men in the furnace of
humiliation." Since, therefore, neither death, nor loss of money,nor bodily
disease, nor dishonor, nor reproach, nor any other thing of that nature, will
be able to grieve him, but makes him even the more joyful, what
foundation for sadness will he have at any time?

8. "What then," says some one, "used not the Saint to be in sadness? Do
you not hear Paul saying, "I have great heaviness, and continual sorrow in
my heart?" This, indeed, is the thing to wonder at, that sorrow brought a
gain, and a pleasure that resulted from the gain; for as the scourge did not
procure them anguish, but gladness; so also again the sorrow procured
them those great crowns. And this is the paradox; that not only the
sadness of the world, but also its joy, contains extreme loss; but in the
case of spiritual things, it is exactly the reverse; and not the joy only, but
the sadness too contains a rich treasure of good things! But how, I proceed
to explain. In the world, a person often rejoices, on beholding an enemy in
trouble; and by this joy he draws on himself a great punishment. Again,
another person mourns, on seeing a brother fall; and because of this
sadness he will procure for himself much favor with God. Seest thou how
godly sorrow is better and more profitable than the joy of the world? Thus
also Paul sorrowed for sinners, and for those who disbelieved in God; and
this sorrow was the means of laying up a great reward for him. But that I
may make what I say more clear, and that ye may know that although
what I assert is very strange, it is nevertheless true, viz. that grief is often
capable of refreshing distressed souls, and of rendering a burdened
conscience light: consider how often women, when they have lost their
most beloved children, break their hearts, and perish, if they are forbidden
to mourn, and to shed tears. But if they do all which those who are sad,
are wont to do, they are relieved, and receive consolation. And what
wonder that this should be the case with women, when you may even see

a prophet affected in a similar manner? Therefore he was continually
saying, "Suffer me - I will weep bitterly - labor not to comfort me,
because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people." So that, oftentimes,
sadness is the bearer of consolation; and if it is so with regard to this
world. much more with regard to spiritual things. Therefore he says,
"Godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, not to be repented of."
This indeed seems to be obscure; but what he says is to this effect: "If
thou grievest over wealth, thou art nothing profited. If for sickness, thou
hast gained nothing, but hast increased thy affliction."

9. And I have heard many, after such experience, blame themselves, and
say, What advantage is it that I have grieved? I have not recovered my
money, and I have injured myself. But if thou hast grieved on account of
sin, thou hast blotted it out, and hast reaped the greatest pleasure. If thou
hast grieved for thy brethren who have fallen, thou hast both encouraged
and comforted thyself, and hast also restored them; and even if thou wert
not to profit them, thou hast an abundant recompense. And that thou
mayest learn that this grieving for those who have fallen, though we should
not at all benefit them, still brings us a large reward, hear what Ezekiel
says; or rather, what God Himself speaks through him. For when He had
sent certain messengers to overturn the city, and to consume all the
dwellings with sword and fire, along with their inhabitants, He thus
charges one of them: "Set a mark upon the forehead of the men that groan,
and are in anguish." And after charging the others, and saying, "Begin ye
from mine holy ones," He goes on to add, "But upon whomsoever the sign
is, touch them not." For what reason, tell me? Because although they avail
nothing, they nevertheless lament the things which are done, and deplore
them. And again, He accuses others, saying, That in their luxury, and
gluttony, and enjoyment of great security, when they beheld the Jews
carried away into captivity, they did not grieve, nor partake of their
sadness. And hear what He says, reproaching them: "They suffered
nothing in the affliction of Joseph:" meaning by Joseph the whole people.
And again: "The inhabitants of Aenan went not forth to bewail the house
next unto them." For although they are justly punished, God willeth that
we should condole with them, and not rejoice or insult. "For if I that
punish," saith He, "do not this rejoicingly; nor take pleasure in their
punishment; for "I do not at all will the death of the sinner;" it is right that

thou shouldest imitate thy Lord; and shouldest mourn for this very thing,
that the sinner hath provided matter and occasion for a just punishment."
So that if any one entertains a godly sorrow, he will thence reap a great
advantage.

10. Since therefore those who are scourged are more blessed than the
scourgers, and those in tribulation among us than those who are free from
it outside the Christian pale; and those who are sad are more blessed than
those in pleasure; what further source of tribulation shall we have? On this
account we should call no man happy, save him only who lives according
to God. These only the Scripture terms blessed. For "blessed," it is said,
"is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly. Blessed is
he whom Thou chastenest, and teachest him out of Thy law. Blessed are
the undefiled in the way. Blessed are all they who trust in Him. Blessed is
the people whose God is the Lord. Blessed is he whom his soul
condemneth not. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord." And again,
Christ speaks thus: "Blessed are they that mourn; blessed are the humble;
blessed are the meek; blessed are the peacemakers; blessed are they who
are persecuted for righteousness' sake." Seest thou how the divine laws
everywhere pronounce blessed none of the rich, or of the well-born, or of
the possessors of glory, but the man who has gotten hold of virtue. For
what is required of us is, that in every thing we do or suffer, the fear of
God should be the foundation; and if you implant this as the root, not
merely will ease, and honor, and glory, and attention, produce fruits that
shall be pleasurable to thee; but hostilities also, and calumnies, and
contempt, and disgrace, and torments, and all things without exception.
And just as the roots of trees are bitter in themselves, and yet produce our
sweetest fruits, so, verily, godly sorrow will bring us an abundant
pleasure. They know, who have often prayed with anguish, and shed
tears, what gladness they have reaped; how they purged the conscience;
how they rose up with favorable hopes! For as I am always saying, it is
not the nature of the things, but our disposition, which is wont to make us
sad or joyful. If then we can render the latter such as it ought to be, we
shall have a pledge for all gladness. And just as, with the body, it is not so
much the nature of the air, or the things it meets from without, as its own
internal condition, that either injures or assists it, so also it is in the case of
the soul; and much more so; for in the one case, there is the necessity of

nature; in the other, the whole is seated in the power of choice. Therefore
Paul, when he had endured innumerable evils - ship-wrecks, wars,
persecutions, plots, the assaults of robbers, and things too numerous to be
recounted, dying also daily deaths - was so far from grieving or being
discontented, that he gloried, and rejoiced, and said, "I now rejoice in my
sufferings, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in
my flesh." And again: "And not only so, but we glory in tribulations."
Now, glorying signifies an extension of pleasure.

11. If then thou desirest joy, seek not after riches, nor bodily health, nor
glory, nor power, nor luxury, nor sumptuous tables, nor vestures of silk,
nor costly lands, nor houses splendid and conspicuous, nor any thing else
of that kind; but pursue that spiritual wisdom which is according to God,
and take hold of virtue; and then nought of the things which are present, or
which are expected, will be able to sadden thee. Why do I say to sadden?
Verily, the things that make others sad, will prove to thee an accession of
pleasure. For scourges, and death, and losses, and slanders, and the being
evil entreated, and all such things, when they are brought upon us for
God's sake, and spring from this root, will bring into our souls much
pleasure. For no one will be able to make us miserable, if we do not make
ourselves such; nor, on the other hand, blessed, if we do not make our.
selves such, following up the grace of God.

12. And that ye may learn that he only is blessed, who feareth the Lord, I
will now demonstrate this to you, not by what has happened in past
times, but by what has befallen ourselves. Our city was in danger of being
utterly effaced; and no man among the rich, or eminent, or illustrious,
dared to appear in public, but all fled, and hurried out of the way. But
they who feared God, the men who passed their time in monasteries,
hastened down with much boldness, and set all free from this terror; and
the terrible events that had taken place, and the threats which had been
expected to be put into execution, were so far from causing them to fear, or
from throwing them into anxiety, that although they were placed far off
from the calamity, and had no share in it, they cast themselves willingly
into the midst of the fire, and rescued all; and as for death, which seems
universally terrible and awful, they awaited it with the utmost readiness,
and ran to meet it with more pleasure than others do towards principalities
and honors. And why, but because they knew, that this is the greatest

principality and honor? And they shewed in very deed that he only is
blessed who lays hold of the wisdom which is from above, that he
undergoes no change and sustains no adversity, but enjoys a continued
tranquillity, and laughs to scorn all things which seem to be sorrowful. At
the present time at least, those who were once in power are oppressed by
ranch sadness, inhabiting the prison, and loaded with chains, and daily
expecting to be put to death. But these men on the contrary enjoy the
purest pleasure; and if it be their lot to suffer anything terrible, this, and
the very things which seem formidable to others, are welcome to them, for
they know well towards what point they are running, and what lot will
await them when they depart hence. But whilst they live with so much
exactness, and smile at death, they nevertheless grieve for others, and reap
therefrom, in turn, the greatest advantage. Let us then be in earnest to take
care of our souls, and nothing which may come unlooked for can make us
sad. And on behalf of those Who are in prison, let us beseech God that He
will deliver them from their present calamity. For it was in God's power
at once to release us from this dire evil, and not to suffer even the smallest
part of it to remain; but in order that we may not again go back to our
former negligence, He hath provided that the torrent of these evils should
subside gently and by little and little, holding us fast to the same pious
resolutions.

13. And that this is true, and that many would have gone back to their
former supineness, if we had been released from the whole difficulty at
once, is manifest from this circumstance; that whilst yet the remnants of
the calamity are left, whilst the sentence of the Emperor is yet doubtful,
and those who conducted the affairs of the city are all in prison, many of
our fellow inhabitants, through their inordinate desire of bathing, run to the
river, there making endless merriment, behaving wantonly, leaping,
dancing, and dragging women after them. What pardon can such be worthy
of? What kind of excuse can they offer? Or rather, what kind of
punishment and vengeance do they not deserve? The head of the city is in
the public prison; our members are in exile; the sentence concerning them
is doubtful; and dost thou, I ask, dance, sport, and laugh? "Why, we could
not endure," says some one, "to remain without the bath?" O shameless
disposition, sordid and perverted! How many months, I ask, how many
years, have past? Thou hast not been as yet shut out from the bath for

twenty days; and thou art as much distressed and discontented, as if thou
hadst continued without washing for a whole year! Tell me, was this thy
state, when thou wert expecting an attack from the military, when thou
wert daily anticipating bring put to death, when thou fleddest to the
deserts, and wast hurrying to the mountain tops? If any one had then
proposed to thee to remain "a year" without the bath, so that thou
mightest be rescued from the impending distress, wouldest thou not
readily have accepted the proposal, and submitted to it? When, therefore,
it were becoming that thou shouldest give thanks to God, Who hath freed
thee from all these things without any loss, dost thou again grow wanton
and contemptuous; and when the fear has passed away, turn back afresh
to a worse state of negligence? Have these dire events really touched thee,
and yet art thou so desirous of the baths? Why, if the bath had been
permitted, would not the calamity of those who are yet in confinement
have been sufficient to persuade those who are not in the same grievous
condition to be forgetful of every luxury? Life itself is at stake, and dost
thou remember the baths, and desire to be luxurious? Dost thou despise
the danger because thou hast now escaped it? Take heed lest thou entangle
thyself in the necessity of a greater punishment, and call back in larger
measure the wrath which is removed, and experience the very thing which
Christ declared concerning the devils. For He says, that "when the unclean
spirit is gone out, and afterwards findeth the house void and swept, he
taketh seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and entereth into the
soul, and the last state of that man is worse than the first." Therefore let
us also fear, lest now we are liberated from our former evils, we afterwards
by our listlessness draw upon us those which are greater! I know that ye
yourselves are free from this folly; but ye should restrain, punish, and
sober those who walk disorderly, that ye may always rejoice even as Paul
commanded, that both for our own good works, and for our forethought
for others, we may enjoy both here and in the life to come an abundant
recompense; through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by Whom, and with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be
glory, honor, and adoration, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.

HOMILY 19

On the Sunday called "Episozomenes," to those who had come to
Antioch from the country - also on the subject of avoiding oaths.

1. YE have reveled during the last few days in the Holy Martyrs! Ye have
taken your fill of the spiritual feast! Ye have all exulted with honest
exultation! Ye have beheld their ribs laid bare, and their loins lacerated; the
blood flowing forth all around; ten thousand forms of torture! Ye have
seen human nature exhibiting that which is above nature, and crowns
woven with blood! Ye have danced a goodly dance throughout the whole
city; this, your noble captain leading you on; but sickness compelled me to
remain at home, although against my will. But if I did not take a part in the
festival, I partook of the pleasure of it. If I could not have the enjoyment
of your public assembly, yet did I share in your gladness. For such is the
power of love, that it makes those who are not actually in the enjoyment
to rejoice equally with those who are; persuading them to think the good
things of their neighbor common to themselves. Therefore even whilst I sat
at home, I was rejoicing with you; and now whilst I am not yet entirely
freed from my sickness, I have risen up, and run to meet you, that I may
see your much desired faces, and take a part in the present festival.

2. For I think the present day to be a very great festival indeed on account
of our brethren, who by their presence beautify our city, and adorn the
Church; a people foreign to us in language, but in harmony with us
concerning the faith, a people passing their time in tranquillity, and leading
an honest and sober life. For among these men there are no spectacles of
iniquity - no horse racings, nor harlots, nor any of that riot which
pertains to a city, but every kind of licentiousness is banished, and great
sobriety flourishes every where. And the reason is, that their life is a
laborious one; and they have, in the culture of the soil, a school of virtue
and sobriety, and follow that art which God introduced before all others
into our life. For before the sin of Adam, when he enjoyed much freedom,
a certain tillage of the ground was enjoined upon him; not indeed a
laborious or a troublesome one, but one which afforded him much good
discipline, for he was appointed, it is said, "to till the garden, and to keep
it." Each of these men you may see at one time employed in yoking the

laboring oxen, and guiding the plough, and cutting the deep furrow; and at
another ascending the sacred pulpit, and cultivating the souls of those
under their authority; at one time cutting away the thorns from the soil
with a bill-hook, at another purging out the sins of the soul by the Word.
For they are not ashamed of work like the inhabitants of our city, but they
are ashamed of idleness, knowing that this has taught every kind of
wickedness; and that to those who love it, it has proved a teacher of
iniquity from the beginning.

3. These are our philosophers, and theirs the best philosophy, exhibiting
their virtue not by their outward appearance, but by their mind. The pagan
philosophers are in character no wise better than those who are engaged on
the stage, and in the sports of actors; and they have nothing to shew
beyond the threadbare cloak, the beard, and the long robe! But these, quite
on the contrary, bidding farewell to staff and beard, and the other
accouterments, have their souls adorned with the doctrines of the true
philosophy, and not only with the doctrines, but also with the real
practice. And were you to question any one of these, who live a rustic life
at the spade and plough, as to the dogmas respecting which the pagan
philosophers have discoursed an infinite deal, and have expended a
multitude of words, without being able to say any thing sound; one of
these would give you an accurate reply from his store of wisdom. And not
only is this to be wondered at, but that they confirm the credibility of
these doctrines by their actions. For of the fact that we have an immortal
soul, and that we shall hereafter render an account of what we have done
here, and stand before a fearful Tribunal, their minds. are at once
thoroughly persuaded, and they have also regulated their whole course of
life by such hopes as these; and have become superior to all worldly show,
instructed as they have been by the sacred Scriptures, that "all is vanity,
yea, vanity of vanities," and they do not greedily long for any of those
things which seem to be so splendid.

4. These too know how to philosophize concerning God, even as God
hath determined; and if, taking one of them, you were now to bring
forward some pagan philosopher; - or rather, now you could not find
one! - But if you were to take one of these, and then open the books of
their ancient philosophers, and go through them, and institute an enquiry
by way of parallel as to what these now answer, and the others in their

day philosophically advanced; you would see how much wisdom belonged
to the former, and how much folly to the latter. For whilst some of those
would aver, that the things existing were destitute of a providence, and
that the creation had not its origin from God; that virtue was not sufficient
for itself, but stood in need of wealth, and nobility. and external splendor,
and other things still more ridiculous; and whilst these, on the other hand,
would discourse wisely respecting Providence, respecting the future
Tribunals of judgment, respecting the creative power of God, bringing
forth all things out of nothing, as well as respecting all other points,
although at the same time they were entirely destitute of worldly
schooling; who could but learn from hence the power of Christ, which hath
proved these unearned and simple persons to be as much wiser than those,
who make so much boast of their wisdom, as men of discretion are seen to
be in comparison of little children? For what harm can result to them from
their simplicity in regard to learning, when their thoughts are full of much
wisdom? And what advantage have those philosophers from this learning,
when the understanding is devoid of right thoughts? It were just as if one
should have a sword that had its hilt of silver, whilst the blade was weaker
than the vilest lead. For truly these philosophers have their tongue decked
out with words and names, but their understanding is full of mere
weakness and good for nothing. Not so with these philosophers, but quite
the reverse. Their understanding is full of spiritual wisdom and their mode
of life is a transcript of their doctrines. Amongst these there are no
luxurious women; there are no ornaments of dress, nor colors, nor paints;
but all such corruption of manners is discountenanced. Hence the
population under their charge are the more readily trained to sobriety, and
the law which Paul gave, when he directed that food and covering should
be had, and nothing more be sought after, they most rigidly observe.
Amongst them, there are no perfumed unguents to fascinate the senses;
but the earth bringing forth herbs, prepares for them a varied fragrance of
flowers, above all the skill of perfumers. For this reason, their bodies as
well as souls enjoy a sound state of health, inasmuch as they have
banished all luxury of diet, and driven off all the evil floods of
drunkenness; and they eat just as much as suffices for subsistence. Let us
then not despise them because of their outward appearance, but let us
admire their mind. For of what advantage is the external habit, when the
soul is more wretchedly clad than any beggar! The man ought to be praised

and admired, not for dress, nay more, not for his bodily form, but for his
soul. Lay bare the soul of these men, and you will see its beauty and the
wealth it possesses, in their words, in their doctrines, and in the whole
system of their manners!

5. Let the Gentiles then be ashamed, let them hide their heads, and slink
away on account of their philosophers, and their wisdom, wretched as it is
beyond all folly! For the philosophers that have been amongst them in
their lifetime have hardly been able to teach their doctrines to a very few,
who can easily be numbered; and when any trifling peril overtook them,
they lost even these. But the disciples of Christ, the fishermen, the
publicans, and the tent-makers, in a few years brought over the whole
world to the truth; and when from that time, ten thousand perils have been
constantly arising, the preaching of the Gospel was so far from being put
down, that it still flourishes and increases; and they taught simple people,
tillers of the ground, and occupied with cattle, to be lovers of wisdom.
Such are the persons, who beside all the rest having deeply rooted in them
that love which is the source of all good things, have hastened to us,
undertaking so long a journey, that they might come and embrace their
fellow-members.

6. Come then, and in return for these favors, (I speak of their love and kind
feeling), let us give them a provision, and so send them home; and let us
again raise the question concerning oaths; that from the minds of all we
may pluck up by the roots this evil custom. But first, I desire to put you a
little in mind today of the things we spoke of lately.

When the Jews, having been released from Persia, and set free from that
tyranny, were returned back to their own county, "I saw," saith one, "a
flying sickle, twenty cubits in length, and ten cubits broad." They heard
also the Prophet giving them this instruction, "This is the curse, that goeth
forth over the face of the whole land, and entereth into the house of him
that sweareth falsely; and it shall rest in the midst thereof, and throw
down the timber and all the stones." When we had read this passage, we
also enquired then why it was, that it should destroy not the swearer only,
but also his house, and we stated this to be the reason; that God will have
the punishments of the most grievous sins to reason of the overthrow,
might avoid imitating the sin.

7. This also happened at Sodom. For when they burned in their lust one
towards another, then too the very earth itself was burned up, being
kindled by the fire from above. For He designed, that the vengeance of this
sin should permanently remain.

And observe the mercy of God! Those who had sinned, He caused not to
continue burning to the present day, but when they had been for once in
flames, He buried them; and burning up the face of the ground, He placed
it visibly before all who after should desire to look at these things; and
now the sight of the land, through all the generations since, hath given an
admonition beyond all lest ye suffer the lot of Sodom!" For preoften,
when they hear the Scripture discoursing of these things, are not much
terrified; site, and see the whole surface of it disfigured, and have
witnessed the effects of the fire, with soil no where visible, but every thing
dust and ashes, they come away astonished with the sight, and taking with
them a strong lesson of chastity. For truly, the very nature of the
punishment was a pattern of the nature of the sin! Even as they devised a
barren intercourse, not having for its end the procreation of children, so did
God bring on them such a punishment, as made the womb of the land ever
barren, and destitute of all fruits! For this reason also He threatened to
destroy the dwellings of the swearers, in order that by their punishments,
they may make others to be more self-controlled.

8. But I am ready to shew today, not the destruction of one, two, or three
houses in consequence of oaths, but that of a whole city and of a people
beloved of God; of a nation that had always enjoyed much of the divine
care; and of a race that had escaped many dangers. For Jerusalem herself,
the city of God, which had the holy ark, and all that divine service; -
where there were once prophets, and the grace of the Spirit, and the ark;
and the tables of the covenant, and the golden pot; - where angels were
frequent visitors; - this city, I say, when a multitude of wars took place,
and many foreign nations made attacks upon it, as if girt by a wall of
adamant, ever laughed them all to scorn, and whilst the land was utterly
destroyed, sustained no injury! And not only is this to be wondered at,
but that frequently in driving out its enemies, it inflicted upon them a
heavy blow, and enjoyed so much of the providential care of God, that
God Himself said, "I found Israel as a bunch of grapes in the desert; and I
beheld your fathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree." And again, of the

city itself: "As olive berries on the extremity of the highest bough, and
they shall say, Do them no harm." Nevertheless, the city beloved of God;
that had escaped so many perils; that had been favored with pardon,
amidst the multitude of its sins; that alone had been able to avoid
captivity, whilst all the rest were carried away, not once or twice, but very
often; was ruined solely by an oath. But how, I proceed to state.

9. One of their kings was Zedekiah. This Zedekiah took an oath to
Nebuchadnezzar, king of the barbarians, that he would remain in alliance
with him. Afterwards be revolted, in the obligation of his oath, and
suffered the things of which ye shall hear presently. But first, it is
necessary to mention the parable of the prophet, in which he enigmatically
represented all these matters: "The word of the Lord," saith he, "came to
me, saying, Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable, and say,
Thus saith the Lord God: A great eagle, with great wings, and long
extended, full of claws." Here he calls the king of the Babylonians an eagle,
and speaks of him as being "great, and long-winged;" and he calls him
long-extended and "full of claws," on account of the multitude of his army,
and the greatness of his power, and the swiftness of his invasion. For just
as the wings and claws of the eagle are his armor, so are horses and soldiers
to kings. This eagle, he goes on to say, "hath the leading to enter into
Lebanon." What is meant by the "leading?" Counsel - design. And Judaea
is called Lebanon, because of its situation near that mountain. Afterwards,
intending to speak of the oaths and treaties, "He took," saith he, "of the
seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field, that it might take root by
great waters. He placed it to be looked upon; and it grew, and became a
weak vine, and of small stature, and it stretched out its branches towards
him, and its roots were under him." Here he calls the city of Jerusalem a
vine; but in saying that it stretched out its branches towards the eagle, and
that its roots were under him, he purposing to declare the iniquity of this,
he saith, "And there was another great eagle," (speaking of the Egyptian
king), "with great wings, and having many claws; and the vine did bend
itself toward him, and its tendril toward him, and shot out its branches,
that it might be watered. Therefore, I said, Thus saith the Lord God: Shall
it prosper?" That is to say, "after having broken the oath, and the treaties,
shall it be able to remain, or to be safe, or to avoid falling?" Presently, for
the purpose of shewing that this is not to happen, but that it is certainly

to be destroyed on account of the oath, he discourses concerning its
punishment, and alleges the cause. "For its tender roots and its fruits shall
become corrupt, and all which springs therefrom shall be withered." And
for the purpose of shewing that it will not be destroyed by human
strength, but because it hath made God its enemy by means of these oaths,
he subjoins, "Not by a mighty arm, nor by much people, to pluck it up by
its roots." Such indeed is the parable, but the prophet again explains it,
when he says, "Behold, the king of Babylon cometh against Jerusalem."
And then, after saying some other things between, he mentions the oaths
and the treaties. "For" saith he, "he shall make a covenant with him;" and
presently, speaking of the departure from it, he goes on to say, "And he
will depart from him, by sending messengers into Egypt, that they might
give him horses and much people." And then he proceeds to shew that it is
on account of the oath that all this destruction is to take place. "Surely in
the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, he who hath
despised My curse, and hath transgressed My covenant, in the midst of
Babylon he shall die; and not by great power nor surely recompense upon
his own head this covenant which he hath broken; and I will spread My
net upon him." Seest thou, that not once, or twice, but repeatedly, it is
said that because of the oath he was to suffer all these things. For God is
inexorable when oaths are treated contemptuously. Nor merely from the
punishment which was brought upon the city by the oath, but also from
the delay, and the postponement, may it be seen how much God is
concerned for the inviolability of oaths. "For it came to pass," we are told,
"in the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah, on the tenth day of the month,
that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came, and all his host, against
Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built a wall against it round about,
and the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah, and the
ninth day of the month, and there was no bread for the people to eat, and
the city was broken up." He might indeed, at once from the first day, have
delivered them up, and have given them into the hands of their enemies;
but He permitted that they should first be wasted for the space of three
years, and experience a most distressing siege; to the end that during this
interval, being humbled by the terror of the forces without, or the famine
that oppressed the city within, they might compel the king, however
unwillingly, to submit to the barbarian; and some alleviation might be
obtained for the sin committed. And to prove that this is true, and no

conjecture of my own, hear what He saith to him by the prophet: "If thou
shalt go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live,
and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine
house. But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then
shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; and they shall burn
it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. And the king said,
I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver
me into their hands and they mock me. But Jeremiah said, They shall not
deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the word of the Lord, which I speak
unto thee; so shall it be better for thee, and thy soul shall live. But if thou
refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shewed me. All the
women that are left in the king of they are turned away from thee, and
they shall bring out all thy wives, and thy children to the Chaldeans, and
thou shalt not escape out of their hand, for thou shalt be taken by the hand
of the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.

10. But when He did not prevail with him by this address, but he remained
in his sin and transgression, after three years, God delivered up the city,
displaying at once His own clemency and the ingratitude of that king. And
entering in with the utmost ease, they "burnt the house of the Lord, and
the king's house, and the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house, the
captain of the guard burnt, and overthrew the wall of Jerusalem; and
everywhere there was the fire of the barbarian, the oath being the
conductor of the conflagration, and carrying about the flame in all
directions. "And the captain of the guard carried away the rest of the
people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the
king of Babylon. And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the
Lord the Chaldeans brake up, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in
the house of the Lord, did the Chaldees break in pieces. And the pots, and
the flesh-hooks the golden and silver bowls they took away. Moreover,
Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took away the two pillars, and the
bases, and the sea which Solomon had made away Seraiah the chief priest,
and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door; and
out of the city one eunuch that was set over the men of war; and five men
that were in the king's presence; and Shaphan the chief captain, and the
principal scribe, and threescore men. And he took these, and brought them
to the king of Babylon, and the king smote them, and slew them."

11. Be mindful therefore, I pray, now of the "flying sickle" that "resteth in
the sweaters house;" and "destroyeth the walls and the timber and the
stones." Be mindful, I pray, how this oath entered into the city, and
overturned houses, and temple, and walls, and splendid buildings, and
made the city an heap; and that neither the Holy of Holies, nor the sacred
vessels, nor any thing else could ward off that punishment and vengeance,
for that the oath had been transgressed! The city, indeed, was thus
miserably destroyed. But the king endured what Was still more wretched
and deplorable. And as the flying sickle overthrew the buildings, so did it
also cut him down in his flight. For "the king," it says, "went forth by
night, by way of the gate, and the Chaldeans encompassed the city, and
the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook him, and
they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon, and the king
of Babylon gave judgments upon Zedekiah, and slew his sons before his
face, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters, and
carded him to Babylon." What is meant by the expression, "he spake
judgment with him?" He demanded of him an account of his conduct, he
pleaded against him; and first he slew his two sons, that he might be a
spectator of the calamity of his house, and might behold that deplorable
tragedy; and then he put out his own eyes. For what reason, I ask again,
did this occur? them; and that they who had eyes might discern by him
who was bereft of sight, how great an evil is an oath! Nor only these; but
all who dwelt by the way, beholding the man fettered and blinded, might
learn by his calamity the greatness of his sin. Therefore one of the
prophets declares, "He shall not see Babylon." And another, "He shall be
carried away to Babylon." And the prophecy seems, indeed, to be
contradictory. But it is not so; for both of these are true. For he saw not
Babylon, though he was carried away to Babylon. How then did he not
see Babylon? Because it was in Judaea he had his eyes put out; for where
the oath had been set at nought, there also was it vindicated, and he
himself subjected to punishment. And how was he carried away to
Babylon? In a state of captivity. For since the punishment was twofold,
deprivation of sight and captivity, the prophets took them severally. The
one saith, "He shall not see Babylon," speaking of the loss of his eyes; the
other saith, "He shall be carried away to Babylon," signifying his
captivity.

12. Knowing these things, theft, brethren, and gathering up what has been
now advanced, as well as what has been said before; let us at last desist
from this evil custom, yea, I pray and beseech you all! For if in the old
dispensation, when the Jews had not the strictest moral wisdom required
of them, but much condescension was extended to them, such wrath was
the effect of one oath; such capture and captivity; what punishment is it
likely that those who swear should now be subjected to, after an express
law forbidding the practice, and so large an addition of precepts. Is it,
indeed, all that is required, that we come to the assembly, and hear what is
spoken? Why truly it is a reason for greater condemnation, and for more
inevitable punishment, that we are continually hearing, and yet do not
what is bidden! What excuse shall we have, or what pardon, if assembling
here from earliest youth to latest old age, and enjoying the advantage of so
much instruction, we remain just like them, and do not take pains to
correct a single defect. Let no one henceforth allege custom. For this is the
very thing at which I am indignant and provoked, that we are not able to
get the better of custom. And, pray, if we do not get the better of custom,
how can we get the better of concupiscence, which hath its root even in
the principles of our nature; for it is natural to feel desire; but to desire
wickedly, comes after of choice. But this practice of sweating takes not
even its first principle from nature, but from mere negligence.

13. And that thou mayest learn that not from the difficulty of the thing,
but through our inattention, this sin has advanced to such a pitch, let us
call to mind how many things far more difficult than these, men
accomplish; and that too without expecting any recompense therefrom.
Let us think what services the Devil imposes; how laborious, how
troublesome they are; and yet, the difficulty has not become an obstacle to
these services. For what can be more difficult, I ask, than when any young
person delivering himself up to those, who undertake to make his limbs
supple and pliant, uses his most strenuous exertion to bend his whole
body into the exact shape of a wheel, and to turn over upon the pavement;
his powers being tasked at the same time through the eyes, and through
the movement of the hands, as well as other convolutions for the purpose
of being transformed into the likeness of woman-kind. Yet neither the
difficulty of these feats, nor the degradation arising from them, are thought
of. And again, those who are dragged upon the dancing-stage, and use the

members of the body as though they were wings, who that beholds them
can help being struck with wonder? So too they who toss knives aloft in
the air one after another, and catch them all by the handle, whom might
they not put to shame of those who refuse to undergo any labor for the
sake of virtue? And what can any one say of those men, who balancing a
pole on the forehead, keep it just as steady as a tree rooted in the ground?
And this is not the only marvelous part of the affair but that they set little
children to wrestle with one another on the top of the tree; and neither the
hands, nor any other part of the body assisting, the forehead alone
sustains the pole unshaken, and with more steadiness than any kind of
fastening. Again: another walks on the slenderest rope, with the same
fearlessness as men do when they run over level plains. Nevertheless these
things, which even in thought seem impracticable, have become possible
by art. What like this have we, I ask, to allege concerning oaths? What kind
of difficulty? what toil? what art? what danger? There is only needed on
our part a little earnestness, and the whole of our task will be quickly
performed.

14. And do not tell me, "I have accomplished that thou hast not as yet
done any thing; for this little, if neglected, is destruction to all the rest.
Often indeed when men have built a house, and put on the roof, they have
destroyed the whole fabric, by not making any concern of a single the that
has been shaken off from it. And one may see the same thing occur with
respect to garments; for there too if a small hole is made, and not repaired,
a large rent is the consequence. And this also is frequently the case in
regard to floods; for these, if they find but a small entrance, let in the
whole torrent. Thou also, then, even if thou hast fortified thyself all
around, and but a small part be left still unfortified, yet block up this also
against the devil, that thou mayest be made strong on all sides! Thou hast
seen the sickle! Thou hast seen the head of John! Thou hast heard the
history pertaining to Saul! Thou hast heard the manner of the Jewish
captivity! And beside all these, thou hast heard the sentence of Christ
declaring, that not only to commit perjury, but to swear in any way, is a
diabolical thing, and the whole a device of the evil one. Thou hast heard
that every where perjuries follow oaths. Putting all these things then
together, write them upon thy understanding. Dost thou not see how
women and little children suspend Gospels from their necks as a powerful

amulet, and carry them about in all places wherever they go. Thus do thou
write the commands of the Gospel and its laws upon thy mind. Here there
is no need of gold or property, or of buying a book; but of the will only,
and the affections of the soul awakened, and the Gospel will be thy surer
guardian, carrying it as thou wilt then do, not outside, but treasured up
within; yea, in the soul's secret chambers. When thou risest up then from
thy bed, and when thou goest out of thine house, repeat this law: "I say
unto you, Swear not at all." And the saying will be to thee a discipline; for
there is no need of much labor, but only of a moderate degree of attention.
And that this is true, may thus be proved. Call thy son, and frighten him,
and threaten to lay a few stripes upon him, if he does not duly observe
this law; and thou wilt see, how he will forthwith abstain from this
custom. Is it not therefore truly absurd, that little children, out of the fear
we inspire, should perform this commandment, and that we should not
fear God as our sons fear us?

15. What then I said before this, I now again repeat. Let us lay down a law
for ourselves in this matter; not to meddle either with public or private
affairs until we have fulfilled this law; and then surely under the pressure
of this obligation we shall easily conquer, and we shall at once adorn
ourselves, and decorate our city. For consider what a thing it would be to
have it said every where throughout the world, "A practice becoming
Christians is established at Antioch, and you will hear no one giving
utterance to an oath, even though the greatest necessity is laid upon him!"
This is what the neighboring cities will certainly hear; nay, not the
neighboring cities only, but even to the ends of the each will the report be
conveyed. For it is indeed probable that both the merchants who mix with
you, and others who arrive from this place, will report all these matters.
When, therefore, many persons in the way of encomium mention the
harbors of other cities, or the markets, or the abundance of wares, enable
those who come from hence to say, that there is that at Antioch, which is
to be seen in no other city; for that the men who dwell there would sooner
have their tongues cut out, than suffer an oath to proceed from their
mouths! This will be your ornament and defense, and not only so, but it
will bring an abundant reward. For others also will certainly emulate, and
imitate you. But if, when a person has gained but one or two, he shall
receive so great a reward from God; what recompense shall ye not receive

when ye are the instructors of the whole world. It is your duty then to
bestir yourselves, to be watchful, and to be sober; knowing that not only
from our own personal good works, but from those we have also wrought
in others, shall we receive the best recompense, and enjoy much favor with
God, which may He grant us all continually to enjoy, and hereafter to
obtain the kingdom of heaven, in Christ Jesus our Lord; to Whom with the
Father, and the Holy Ghost, be glory and power both now and ever, and
world without end. Amen.

HOMILY 20

That the fast of Lent is not sufficient to make us competent to
partake of the Communion, but that holiness is the first thing
required. How it is possible not to entertain resentment, and that
God takes much account of this law; find that the entertaining of
resentment punishes those who are guilty of it even before they
reach the place of torment. - Also concerning abstinence from
oaths, and those who have not succeeded in abstaining from
swearing.

1. AT length the season is verging towards the end of the Fast, and
therefore we ought the more earnestly to devote ourselves to holiness. For
as in the case of those who run a race, all their circuits will be of no avail if
they miss the prize; so neither will any advantage result from these
manifold labors and toils with regard to the fast, if we are not able to enjoy
the sacred Table with a good conscience. For this end are fasting and Lent
appointed, and so many days of solemn assemblies, auditories, prayers,
and teachings, in order that by this earnestness being cleansed in every,
possible way from so that should this not be the result, we shall have
sustained so much labor entirely in vain, and without any profit. Let every
one, therefore, consider with himself what defect he hath corrected, what
good work he hath attained to; what sin he hath cast off, what stain he
hath purged away; in what respect he has become better. And should he
discover that in this good traffic he has made any gain by the fast, and be
conscious in himself of much care taken of his wounds, let him draw near!
But if he hath remained negligent, having nothing to shew but mere fasting,
and hath done nothing which is right besides, let his remain outside; and
then let him enter, when he hath purged out all these offenses. Let no one
rest on the fast merely; whilst continuing unreformed in evil practices. For
it is probable, that he who omits fasting may obtain pardon, having
infirmity of body to plead; but it is impossible that he can have an excuse
who hath not amended his faults. Thou hast not fasted, it may be, on
account of bodily weakness. Tell me for what reason thou art not
reconciled to thine enemies? Hast thou, indeed, here to allege bodily
infirmity? Again; if thou retainest envy and hatred, what apology hast

thou then I ask? For no one in offenses of this kind is able to take refuge in
the plea of bodily infirmity. And this was a work of Christ's love toward
man, viz. that the chief of the precepts, and those which maintain our life,
should not be impaired in any degree through the weakness of the body.

2. But since we need to practice all the divine laws alike, and more
especially that which bids us consider no man as an enemy, nor retain
resentment long, but forthwith to be reconciled; suffer us today to
discourse to you concerning this commandment. For as it is not to be
imagined that the fornicator and the blasphemer can partake of the sacred
Table, so it is impossible that he who hath an enemy, and bears malice, can
enjoy the holy Communion. And this with good reason. For a man when
he has committed fornication, or adultery, at the same time that he hath
accomplished his lust, hath also completed the sin; and should he be
willing by watchful living to recover from that fail, he may afterwards, by
manifesting great penitence, obtain some relief. But he who is resentful
worketh the same iniquity every day, What excuse can we then have, I
ask, for delivering ourselves willingly to such an evil monster? How canst
thou ask thy Lord to be mild and merciful to thee, when thou hast been so
hard and unforgiving to thy fellow-servant?

3. But thy fellow-servant hath treated thee with contempt perhaps? Yes!
and thou hast treated God with contempt oftentimes. And what
comparison is there between a fellow-servant and the Lord? As to the
former, when he was perchance in some way injured, he insulted thee, and
thou wert exasperated. But thou insultest the Lord, when thou art neither
treated with injustice nor ill-will by Him, but receiving blessing of Him
day by day. Consider, then, that if God chose to search out rigorously
what is done against Him, we should not live a single day. For the prophet
saith, "If Thou wilt be extreme to mark iniquity, O Lord, O Lord, who
shall stand?" And, to pass by all those other things, of which the
conscience of every sinner is aware, and of which he no has no human
witness, but God only; were we to be called to account for those which are
open and admitted, what allowance could we expect for such sins? What if
He were to scrutinize our listlessness and negligence in our prayers; and
how, whilst standing before God and supplicating Him, we do not exhibit
even so much fear and reverence for Him as servants do toward their
masters, as soldiers do toward their officers, as friends do toward friends?

When thou discoursest with a friend, thou givest heed to what thou art
doing, but when waiting on God on account of thy sins, and asking pardon
for so many offenses, and thinking that thou shalt obtain forgiveness, thou
art often listless; and whilst thy knees are lying on the ground, thou
sufferest thy mind to wander every where, in the market, or in the house,
babbling the while with thy mouth vainly and to no purpose! And this we
experience, not once or twice, but frequently! Did God then choose to
scrutinize this alone, do you think that we could obtain pardon, or be able
to find any excuse? Truly, I think not!

4. But what if the evil-speakings which we unkindly utter every day one
against another, were brought forward against us; as well as the rash
judgments with which we condemn our neighbor; and that for no reason,
but because we are fond of blaming, and given to find fault; what, I say,
should we be able to allege in defense? Again, should He scrutinize those
roving glances of ours, and those evil desires which we carry in the mind,
so frequently admitting disgraceful and impure thoughts from the
unlicensed wandering of the eyes, what punishment must we not sustain?
And should He demand a reason for our revilings, (for He saith,
"Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell
fire,") how could we, forsooth, open our mouths, or move our lips at all,
or say any thing great or small in reply? Moreover, as to the vainglorious
feelings we allow in our prayers, our facings, our alms-giving, were we to
scrutinize, them, - I do not say, were God, but were we ourselves, who
are the sinners, to do this, - should we be able to lift up our eyes toward
heaven? Then, as to the deceits which we devise one against another -
praising a brother now, whilst he is present, and discoursing as with a
friend; and when he is absent, reviling him; can we endure the punishments
of all these? Then what of the oaths? or what of the lying? what of the
perjuries? what of the unjust anger, and of the envy with which we too
often regard men when honored, not enemies only, but also friends?
Furthermore, what of the fact, that we are pleased when others suffer evil,
and account the misfortunes of others a consolation for our own distress?

5. But suppose the penalty were exacted for our listlessness in our solemn
assemblies what would our condition be? For this ye cannot but know,
that often whilst God Himself is addressing us all by His prophet, we are
holding frequent and long conversations with those near us, about matters

which in no way concern us. Passing by, then, all the rest, should He
choose to exact of us the penalty due for this sin only, what hope of
salvation will there be? For do not suppose that this offense is a small one,
but if thou wouldest be aware of its magnitude, examine how this very
thing is regarded among men, and then thou wilt perceive the enormity of
the sin. Just venture, when some magistrate is talking to thee, or rather
some friend who is of somewhat superior dignity, to turn from him, and
enter into conversation with thy servant; and thou wilt then perceive,
what thou venturest on in dealing thus with God! For if he be any one of
the more distinguished classes, he will even demand reparation of thee for
such an insult. Yet God, whilst He is treated with as great, and still greater
contempt than this, every day; and that not by one, or two, or three
persons, but by almost all of us; is still forbearing and longsuffering, not in
regard to this alone, but to other things which are far more grievous. For
these things are what must be admitted, and what are obvious to all, and
by almost all men they are daringly practiced. But there are yet others,
which the conscience of those who commit them is privy to. Surely, if we
were to think of all this; if we were to reason with ourselves, supposing
even that we were the cruelest and harshest of men, yet upon taking a
survey of the multitude of our sins, we should for very fear and agony be
unable to remember the injury done by others towards ourselves. Bear in
mind the river of fire; the envenomed worm; the fearful Judgment, where
all things shall be naked and open! Reflect, that what are now hidden
things, are then to be brought to light! But shouldest thou pardon thy
neighbor all these sins which till then await their disclosure are done away
with here; and when thou shalt depart this life, thou wilt not drag after
thee any of that chain of transgressions; so that thou receivest greater
things than thou givest. For many such transgressions, indeed, we have
often committed, which no other person knoweth; and when we think,
that on That Day these our sins shall lie exposed to the eyes of all, upon
the public theater of the universe, we are in pain beyond any punishment,
being choked and strangled by our conscience. Yet this shame, great as it
is; these sins, these punishments, great as they are; there is a possibility of
purging away through forgiveness exercised toward our neighbor.

6. For indeed there is nothing equal to this virtue. Wouldest thou learn the
power of this virtue? "Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me," saith

God, "my soul would not regard them." Nevertheless, those whom Moses
and Samuel were not able to snatch away from God's wrath, this precept
when observed was able to snatch away. Hence it is, that He continually
exhorts those to whom He had spoken these things, saying, "Let none of
you revengefully imagine evil against his brother in your heart," and "let
none of you think of his neighbor's malice." It is not said merely, forego
wrath; but retain it not in thy mind; think not of it; part with all thy
resentment; do away the sore. For thou supposest that thou art paying
him back the injury; but thou art first tormenting thyself, and setting up
thy rage as an executioner within thee in every part, and tearing up thine
own bowels. For what can be more wretched than a man perpetually
angry? And just as maniacs, who never enjoy tranquillity, so also he who
is resentful, and retains an enemy, will never have the enjoyment of any
peace; incessantly raging, as he does, and daily increasing the tempest of
his thoughts calling to mind his words and acts, and detesting the very
name of him who has aggrieved him. Do you but mention his enemy, he
becomes furious at once, and sustains much inward anguish; and should he
chance to get only a bare sight of him, he fears and trembles, as if
encountering the worst evils, Yea, if he perceives any of his relations, if
but his garment, or his dwelling, or street, he is tormented by the sight of
them. For as in the case of those who are beloved, their faces, their
garments, their sandals, their houses, or streets, excite us, the instant we
behold them; so also should we observe a servant, or friend, or house, or
street, or any thing else belonging to those We hate and hold our enemies,
we are stung by all these things; and the strokes we endure from the sight
of each one of them are frequent and continual.

7. What is the need then of sustaining such a siege, such torment and such
punishment? For if hell did not threaten the resentful; yet for the very
torment resulting from the thing itself we ought to forgive the offenses of
those who have aggrieved us. But when deathless punishments remain
behind, what can be more senseless than the man, who both here and there
brings punishment upon himself, while he thinks to be revenged upon his
enemy! For suppose that we see him still prosperous, then we are ready
to die of chagrin; but if in an adverse condition, we are in fear, lest some
propitious turn of events should take place. But for both of these there is
stored up for us an inevitable punishment. For, "Rejoice not," he saith,

"when thine enemy stumbleth." And tell me not of the greatness of the
injuries received; for it is not this which maketh thy wrath to be retained;
but this, that thou art unmindful of thine own offenses; that thou hast not
before thine eyes either hell or the fear of God! To convince thee that this
is true, I will endeavor to make it manifest from the events which have
happened in this city. For when the persons impeached of those flagrant
crimes were dragged to the tribunal of justice; - when the fire was kindled
within, and the executioners stood around, and were lacerating their ribs, if
any one standing beside them had proclaimed, "If ye have any enemies,
dismiss your resentment, and we shall be able to set you free from this
punishment;" - would they not have kissed their very feet? And why do
I say their feet? If one had bidden them take them for their masters, they
would not then have refused. But if punishment that is human, and hath
its bounds, would have triumphed over all anger, much more would the
punishment to come, if it had continual possession of our thoughts, expel
from the soul not only resentment, but every evil imagination? For what is
easier, I ask, than to get rid of resentment against the injurer? Is there any
long journey to be undertaken? Is there any expenditure of money? Is the
aid of others to be invoked? It suffices only to resolve, and the good deed
at once reaches the goal. What punishment, then, must we not deserve, if
on account of worldly affairs we stoop to slavish occupations; and shew a
servility unworthy of ourselves; and expend money; and enter into
conversation with porters, that we may flatter impious men; and do and
say all manner of things, so that we may perfectly attain the end we have
in view; and yet cannot endure, for the sake of God's laws, to entreat a
brother who hath injured us, but consider it a disgrace to be the first to
make advances. Art thou ashamed, tell me, when thou art going to be the
first to make gain? Rather, on the contrary, you ought to be ashamed of
persisting in this passion; and waiting until the person who has commuted
the injury comes to you to be reconciled; for this is a disgrace, and a
reproach, and the greatest loss.

8. For he who comes the first it is, who reaps all the fruit; and when at the
entreaty of another thou layest aside thine anger, the good work is to be
accounted his; for thou hast discharged the law as doing a favor to him, not
as obeying God. But if, when no one entreats, when not even the man who
has done the injury approaches, or solicits thee, thou thyself dismissing

from thy thoughts all shame, and all delay, runnest forward freely to the
injurer, and dost quell anger entirely, the good deed becomes wholly thine
own, and thou shalt receive all the reward. If I say, "Practice fasting," thy
plea, perchance, is bodily weakness. If I say, "Give to the poor," it is
poverty, and bringing up children. If I say, "Make time for the assembles
of the Church," it is worldly cares. If I say, "‘Give heed to what is
spoken, and consider the power of what is taught," it is want of learning.
If I say, "Correct another," you say, "When counsel is given him, he takes
no heed, for I have often spoken, and been scorned." Frigid, as such
pretenses are, yet you have some pretenses to allege. But suppose I say,
"Dismiss thine anger," which of these wilt thou then allege?" For neither
infirmity of body, nor poverty, nor lack of culture, nor want of leisure, nor
any other thing of that kind hast thou to advance; but this sin is above all
other the most inexcusable. How wilt thou be able to stretch thine hands
toward heaven, or how to move thy tongue, or to ask pardon? For
although God be desirous to pardon thy sins, thou thyself dost not suffer
Him, while thou retainest that of thy fellow-servant! But suppose that he
is cruel, fierce, and savage, and greedy of revenge and retaliation? Why for
this reason thou oughtest especially to grant forgiveness. Hast thou been
wronged much, and robbed, and slandered, and injured in matters of the
first importance; and dost thou wish to see thine enemy punished? Yet
even for this, it will be of use to thee to pardon him. For suppose that
thou thyself takest vengeance, and prosecutest it, either by words, by
deeds, or imprecation against the adversary; then God will not afterwards
prosecute it too, inasmuch as thou hast taken thy revenge; and not only
will He not prosecute the matter for thee, but will also demand a penalty
of thee as a despiser of Himself. For if this same thing takes place amongst
mankind, viz. that if we beat the servant of another, the master is
indignant, and calls the act an insult (for although we be treated
injuriously, whether by slaves, or by freemen, it is fitting that we should
await the legal decisions of magistrates or masters); if then even amongst
men, to avenge ourselves would not be safe, how much more so when God
is the avenger!

9. Hath thy neighbor wronged and grieved thee, and involved thee in a
thousand ills? Be it so, yet do not prosecute vengeance on thine own part,
lest thou do desire to thy Lord! Yield the matter to God, and He will

dispose of it much better than thou canst desire. To thee He has given
charge simply to pray for the injurer; but how to deal with him, He hath
ordered thee to leave to Himself, Never canst thou so avenge thyself, as
He is prepared to avenge thee, if thou givest place to Him alone, and dost
not utter imprecations on him who has aggrieved thee; but sufferest God
to be sole arbiter of the sentence. For although we may pardon those who
have aggrieved us; although we may be reconciled; although we may pray
for them; yet God does not pardon, unless they themselves are converted,
and become better. And He withholds pardon, with a view to their own
advantage. For He proves thee, and approves thee for thy spiritual
wisdom; but visits him, in order that he may not grow worse by thy
wisdom. So that the common saying on this subject is not to the point.
For many there are, who when I reproach them because after being
exhorted to be reconciled to their enemies, they will not be persuaded to it,
think fit to proffer this apology, which is nothing less than a cloak for
their iniquity. "I am unwilling," says one, "to be reconciled, lest I should
make the man worse, more ill-tempered, and more disposed to treat me
contemptuously hereafter." Besides this, they also make this plea: "Many
people," say they, "think it is weakness in me to come first to a
reconciliation, and to entreat my enemy." All these things are foolish; for
the Eye that slumbers not has seen thy good intention; wherefore, it
behoveth thee to make no account of the opinion of thy fellow-servants,
when thou hast gained the opinion of the Judge, Who is about to try thy
cause.

10. But if thy concern be, test thine enemy should become worse by thy
clemency learn this, - that it is not thus he is made worse; but far rather
if thou art unreconciled. For although he were the vilest of men; although
he might neither confess nor publish it openly; yet he will silently
approve thy Christian wisdom, and in his own conscience will respect thy
gentleness. Should he, however, persist in the same iniquity, whilst thou
art endeavoring to soften and conciliate, he will have to abide the heaviest
punishment from God. And that ye may know, that although we should
pray for our enemies, and for those who have injured us, God does not
pardon, if they are likely to become worse by our forbearance, I will
mention to you an ancient piece of history. Miriam once spake against
Moses. What then did God do? He sent a leprosy upon her, and made her

unclean; notwithstanding that in other respects she had been meek and
modest. Afterwards, when Moses himself, the party injured, besought
that the wrath might be removed, God consented not: but what did He
say? "If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed? Let
her remain," saith He, "without the camp seven days." But what He
means is to this effect. "If," saith He, "she had a father, and he had put her
away from his presence, would she not have undergone the rebuke? I
approve thee indeed for thy fraternal piety, and thy meekness and
clemency; but I know when is the due time to remit her punishment." Do
thou then shew all humanity towards thy brother; and do not pardon his
offenses in the desire of a greater punishment for him, but of thy
tenderness and good will; yet understand this very plainly, that the more
he shall slight thee, whilst thou art laboring to conciliate, so much the
greater punishment will he draw down upon himself.

11. What sayest thou? tell me, Is he the worse for thy attentions? This is
blame to him, but thy praise. Thy praise, that, whilst seeing him thus
behave himself, thou didst not desist from doing God's will in conciliating
him. But to him it is blame, because he has not been made better by thy
clemency. But "it is far more desirable that others should be blamed
because of us, than we because of them." Make me not this frigid reply, of
saying, "I am afraid of its being thought that I made an overture to him out
of fear; and that he will therefore despise me the more." Such a reply
indicates a childish and foolish mind, agitated about human approbation.
Let him suppose, that it was out of fear you made the first advance to
him; your reward will be so much the greater; since, being aware of this
beforehand, you still consented to endure all for the fear of God. For he
who is in chase of human approbation, and seeks reconciliation for that
end, curtails the recompense of reward; but he who is quite sure of the
fact, that many will vilify and ridicule him, and even then does not desist,
from the attempt at reconciliation, will have a twofold, yea, a threefold
crown. And this is indeed the man who does it for the sake of God. Nor
tell me, that the man has wronged thee in this, or in that particular; for if
he hath displayed, in his conduct towards thee, every kind of iniquity that
is in man, yet even so God hath enjoined thee to forgive him all!

12. Lo! I forewarn, and testify, and proclaim this with a voice that all may
hear! "Let no one who hath an enemy draw near the sacred Table, or

receive the Lord's Body! Let no one who draws near have an enemy! Hast
thou an enemy? Draw not near! Wilt thou draw near? Be reconciled, and
then draw near, and touch the Holy Thing!" Nor, indeed, is this my
declaration. Rather it is that of the Lord Himself, Who was crucified for
us. That He might reconcile thee to the Father, He refused not to be
sacrificed, and to shed His blood! And art thou unwilling to utter a word,
or to make the first advance, that thou mayest be reconciled to thy
fellow-servant? Hear what the Lord saith, concerning those who are in this
disposition; "If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that
thy brother hath aught against thee" - He does not say, "wait for him to
come to thee," nor "speak with another as mediator," nor "entreat some
other," but "do thou thyself make the advance towards him." For the
exhortation is, "Go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother." O
transcendent wonder! Does He Himself account it no dishonor, that the
gift should be left unoffered, and dost thou think it a mark of disgrace to go
first and be reconciled? And how can such a case, I ask, be deemed worthy
of pardon? Were you to see a member of yours cut off, would you not use
every exertion so that it might be reunited to the body? This do with
regard to thy brethren; when thou seest them cut off from thy friendship,
make all haste to recover them! Do not wait for them to make the first
advance, but press onward, that thou mayest be foremost to receive the
prize.

13. We are commanded to have only one enemy, the devil With him be
thou never reconciled! But with a brother, never be at enmity in thy heart.
And if there should be any narrowness of soul, let it be only an ephemeral
thing, and never last beyond a day's space. For, "let not the sun," he saith,
"go down upon your wrath." For if, before evening, you are reconciled,
you will obtain some pardon from God. But if you remain longer at
enmity, that enmity is no longer the result of your being suddenly carried
away by anger and resentment, but of wickedness, and of a foul spirit, and
one which makes a practice of malice! And this is not the only terrible
thing, that you deprive yourself of pardon, but that the right course
becomes still more difficult. For when one day is past, the shame becomes
greater; and when the second has arrived, it is still further increased; and if
it reach a third, and a fourth day, it will add a fifth. Thus the five become
ten; the ten, twenty; the twenty an hundred; and thenceforth the wound

will become incurable; for as time goes on, the breach becomes wider. But
do thou, O man, give way to none of these irrational passions; nor be
ashamed, nor blush, nor say within yourself, "A short time ago we called
each other such names, and said a vast number of things fit or not fit to be
spoken; and shall I now hurry at once to a reconciliation? Who then will
not blame my excessive easiness?" I answer, no one who has sense will
blame thy easiness; but when thou remainest implacable, then, all persons
will deride thee. Then thou wilt give to the devil the advantage of this wide
breach. For the enmity becomes then more difficult to be got rid of, not by
mere lapse of time, but from the circumstances too that take place in the
meanwhile. For as "charity covereth a multitude of sins," so enmity gives
a being to sins that do not exist, and all persons henceforth, are deemed
worthy of credit who turn accusers; who rejoice in the ills of others, and
blaze abroad what is disgraceful in their conduct.

14. Knowing all these things then, make the first advance to a brother; lay
hold of him before he has entirely shrunk away from thee; and should it be
necessary, to run through all the city on the same day; should it be
necessary to go beyond the walls, or to take a long journey; still leaving all
other things that may be in hand, attend only to this one work of
reconciling thy brother. For if the work be laborious, reflect that it is for
God's sake thou undergoest all this, and thou shalt receive sufficient
consolation. Stir up thy soul also when it is shrinking, and backward, and
bashful, and ashamed, by perpetually harping on this theme and saying,
Why art thou delaying? Why art thou shrinking and holding back? our
concern is not for money, nor for any other of these fleeting things, but for
our salvation. God bids us do all these things, and all things should be
secondary to His commands. This matter is a sort of spiritual
merchandise. Let us not neglect it, let us not be slothful. Let our enemy
too understand that we have taken much pares, in order to do what is
well-pleasing unto God. And though he may again insult, or strike us, or
do any other such thing of a still more grievous kind, let us sustain all
things courageously, since we are not so much benefiting him thereby, as
ourselves. Of all good works, this shall most especially befriend us on
That Day. We have sinned and offended in many and great matters, and
have provoked our Lord. Through His lovingkindness He hath given us
this way of reconciliation. Let us, then, not betray this good treasure. For

had He not power to charge us simply to make reconciliation, and not have
any reward assigned to it? for whom hath He to gainsay or rectify His
appointment? Nevertheless, through His great lovingkindness, He hath
promised us a large and unspeakable reward, and one which we must be
especially desirous to obtain, the pardon of our sins; thus also making this
our obedience more easy of performance.

15. What allowance then can be made for us, if even when we might
receive so great a reward we still do not obey the Lawgiver, but persist in
our contempt; for that this is a contempt is plain from hence. If the
Emperor had laid down a law, that all those who were enemies should be
reconciled to one another, or have their heads cut off, should we not every
one make haste to a reconciliation with his neighbor? Yes! truly, I think
so! What excuse then have we, in not ascribing the same honor to the Lord,
that we should do to those who are our fellow-servants? For this reason
we are commanded to say, "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors." What can be more mild, what more merciful, than this precept!
He hath made thee a judge of the pardon of thine own offenses! If thou
forgivest few things, He forgives thee few! If thou forgivest many things,
He forgives thee many! If thou pardonest from the heart, and sincerely,
God in like manner also pardons thee! If besides pardoning him thou
accountest him a friend, God will also thus deal with thee; so that the more
he has sinned, so much the more is it necessary that we should hasten to a
reconciliation; since it becomes a cause of greater offenses being forgiven
us. Art thou willing to learn that there is no pardon for us, if we are
mindful of injuries, and that there is no one who can deliver us? I will make
what I assert plain by an example. Suppose that a neighbor has done you a
certain injury, that he has seized your goods; has confiscated or embezzled
them; and not to confine myself to such a case, let me add to it more things
and worse beside, and whatever you will; he has longed to destroy you; he
has exposed you to a thousand perils; he has manifested every sort of
malice towards you; and left nothing undone that human wickedness can
do? For not to go over every thing separately, suppose that he has injured
you to such an extent as no one ever injured any before; - why, even in
this case, if you are resentful, you will not be worthy of pardon. And I
will explain how it is so.

16. If one of your servants owed you an hundred pieces of gold; and some
one again was indebted to him in a few pieces of silver; and if the servants'
debtor were to come, and entreat and supplicate you that he might obtain
indulgence, and you were to call in your own servant, and charge him,
saying," Forgive this man the debt, and from the sum thou owest me I will
deduct this debt;" should that servant afterwards be wicked and shameless
enough to seize on his debtor, could any one then rescue him out of your
hands? Would you not most assuredly inflict a thousand stripes upon him,
as having been insulted to the last extremity? And very justly too. This
also God will do: for He will say to thee on That Day, "O wicked and
villainous servant, yea, was it of thine own thou forgavest him? Out of
what thou wert indebted to Me, thou wert ordered to account to him. For
"Remit," He saith, "and I will remit unto thee! although, to speak truly, if
I had not added this condition, it would have been even then thy duty to
have remitted at the instance of thy Lord. But in this case, I did not
command thee as a master, but I asked it as a favor from a friend; and I
asked it out of My own property; and I promised to give greater things in
return; and yet with all this, thou wert not made a better man." Moreover
men, when they act in this manner, put down as much to their own
servants' accounts, as the measure of the debt is. Thus, for example,
suppose the servant owes his master a hundred pieces of gold; and the
debtor of the servant owes ten pieces, should the latter remit his debt, the
master does not remit him his hundred pieces, but these ten only; and all
the rest he still demands. But it is not so with God; if you remit a few
things to your fellow-servant, He remits all your debt.

17. Whence does this appear? From the very Prayer itself. "For if," saith
He, "ye forgive men their debts, your heavenly Father will forgive your
debts." And as much as the difference is between "a hundred pence" and
"ten thousand talents," so great is it between the debts on the one side,
and those on the other!

What punishment then must he not deserve, who when he would receive
ten thousand talents, in the room of a hundred pence, yet will not even so
remit this small sum, but offers up the Prayer against himself. For when
thou sayest, "Forgive us, as we forgive," and afterwards dost not forgive,
thou art supplicating of God nothing else than that He would entirely
deprive thee of all excuse or indulgence. "But I do not presume to say,"

replies some one, "Forgive me as I forgive" but only, "Forgive me." But
what matters this? For if thou say it not thyself, yet God so doeth; as
thou forgivest, He forgives. And this He hath made quite evident from
what follows; for there it is said, "If ye forgive not men, neither doth your
heavenly Father forgive you." Think not, therefore, that it is a pious
caution, not to repeat the whole sentence; nor offer up the Prayer by
halves, but as He bade thee so pray thou, in order that the very obligation
of that expression, putting thee daily in fear, may compel thee to the
exercise of forgiveness towards thy neighbors.

18. Do not tell me, "I have besought him many times, I have intreated, I
have supplicated, but I have not effected a reconciliation." Never desist till
you have reconciled him. For He said not, "Leave thy gift, and go thy
way." Entreat thy brother. But, "Go thy way. Be reconciled." So that,
although you may have made many entreaties, yet you must not desist
until you have persuaded. God entreats us every day, and we do not hear;
and yet He does not cease entreating. And dost thou then disdain to
entreat thy fellow-servant. How is it then possible for thee ever to be
saved? Suppose that thou hast often pleaded and been repulsed; for this,
however, thou wilt obtain a larger reward. For in proportion as he is
contentious, and thou perseverest in entreating, so much the more is thy
recompense increased. In proportion as the good work is accomplished
with greater difficulty, and the reconciliation is one of much labor, so much
the greater will be the judgment on him, and so much the brighter will be
the crowns of victory for thy forbearance. Let us not merely applaud all
this, but exemplify it too in our deeds; and never recede from the work,
until we are restored to our former state of friendship. For it is not enough
merely to avoid grieving an enemy, or doing him an injury, or being in our
minds unkindly disposed towards him; but it is necessary that we should
prepare him to be kindly affected towards ourselves. For I hear many
saying, "I have no hostility; I am not annoyed; neither have I any thing to
do with him." But this is not what God commands, that thou shouldest
have nothing to do with him; but that thou shouldest have much to do
with him. For this reason he is thy "brother." For this reason He said not,
"Forgive thy brother what thou hast against him. But what then? "Go thy
way. First be reconciled to him;" and should he have "any thing against
thee," yet desist not, before thou hast reunited the member in friendly

concord." But thou, who in order that thou mayest obtain a useful servant,
tellest out the gold, and discoursest with many merchants, and often
undertakest long journeys, tell me, art thou not up and doing to the
utmost, in order that thou mayest convert an enemy into a friend? And
how then wilt thou be able to call upon God, whilst thou art thus
neglecting His laws? Assuredly, the possession of a servant will be of no
great profit to us; but the making an enemy a friend, will render God
propitious and favorable toward us; and will easily set us free from our
sins; and gain us praise with men, as well as great security in our life; for
nothing can be more unsafe than he who has even only a single enemy. For
our earthly reputation is injured, whilst such a man is saying a thousand
evil things of us to every body. Our minds are also in a state of
fermentation, and our conscience disturbed; and we are exposed to a
continual tempest of anxious thoughts.

19. Now since we are conscious of the truth of all this, let us set ourselves
free from chastisement and vengeance; and let us shew our reverence for
the present feast, by doing all that has been said; and those same favors
which we think to obtain from the Emperor on account of the feast, let us
ourselves enable others to enjoy. For I hear, indeed, many saying, that the
Emperor, out of his reverence for the Holy Passover, will be reconciled to
the city and will pardon all its offenses. How absurd then is it, that when
we have to depend for our safety upon others, we bring forward the feast,
and its claims; but that when we are commanded to be reconciled one with
another, we treat this same feast with disdain, and think nothing of it. No
one, truly, so pollutes this holy feast, as he does, who, whilst he is
keeping it, cherishes malignity. Or rather, I might say, that such a person
cannot possibly keep it, though he should remain without food ten days
successively. For where there is enmity and strife, there can be neither fast
nor festival. Thou wouldest not dare to touch the holy Sacrifice with
unwashed hands, however pressing the necessity might be. Approach not
then with an unwashed soul! For this is far worse than the other and
brings a heavier punishment. For nothing so fills the mind with impurity,
as anger remaining constantly within it. The spirit of meekness settles not
where wrath or passion exists; and when a man is destitute of the Holy
Spirit, what hope of salvation shall he have, and how shall he walk aright?
Do not then, O beloved, whilst thou art desirous to be revenged of thine

enemy, cast thyself down headlong; nor cause thyself to be left alone
without the guardianship of God! For, in truth, if the duty were a difficult
one, yet the greatness of the punishment, which results from this action of
disobedience, were sufficient to arouse the most slothful and supine, and
to persuade them to undergo every degree of labor. But now our argument
has shewn that the duty is most easy, if we are willing.

20. Let us not then be negligent of what is our life, but let us be in earnest;
and do every thing, in order that we may be without an enemy, and so
present ourselves at the sacred Table. For nothing, - nothing, I repeat, of
what God commands will be difficult, if we give heed: and this is evident
from the case of those who are already reformed. How many used to be
cheated by the habit of using oaths, and to fancy this practice extremely
difficult of reformation. Nevertheless, through the grace of God, when ye
put forth but a little effort, ye for the most part washed yourselves clean
of this vice. For this reason I beseech you to lay aside also what remains,
and to become teachers of others. And to those who have not yet achieved
it, but allege to us the length of time during which they were before
swearers, and say that it is impossible for them to pluck up in a short time
that which has been rooted for many years; I would make this answer, that
where any precept among those commanded by God requires to be put in
due practice, there is no need of length of time, nor of a multitude of days,
nor an interval of years; but of fear only, and reverence of soul; and then
we shall be sure to accomplish it, and that in a short time. But lest you
should suppose that I speak these things at random, take a man whom you
think much addicted to swearing; one that swears more times than he
speaks; hand this man over to me for only ten days, and if I do not rid him
of all his habit in these few days, pass the severest sentence on me.

21. And that these words are not a vain boast, shall be made manifest to
you from things that have already happened. What could be more stupid
than the Ninevites? What more devoid of understanding? Yet,
nevertheless, these barbarian, foolish people, who had never yet heard any
one teaching them wisdom, who had never received such precepts from
others, when they heard the prophet saying, "Yet three days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown,"' laid aside, within three days, the whole of their evil
customs. The fornicator became chaste; the bold man meek; the grasping
and extortionate moderate and kind; the slothful industrious. They did not,

indeed, reform one, or two, or three, or four vices by way of remedy, but
the whole of their iniquity. But whence does this appear, says some one?
From the words of the prophet; for the same who had been their accuser,
and who had said, that "the cry of their wickedness hath ascended up even
to heaven:" himself again bears testimony of an opposite kind, by saying,
"God saw that every one departed from their own evil ways." He does not
say, from fornication, or adultery, or theft, but from their "own evil
ways." And how did they depart? As God knew, not as man judged of the
matter. After this are we not ashamed, must we not blush, if it turns out
that in three days only the barbarians laid aside all their wickedness, but
that we, who have been urged and taught during so many days, have not
got the better of one bad habit? These men had, moreover, gone to the
extreme of wickedness before; for when you hear it said, "The cry of their
wickedness is come up before me;" you can understand nothing else than
the excess of their wickedness. Nevertheless, within three days they were
capable of being transformed to a state of complete virtue. For where the
fear of God is, there is no need of days, or of an interval of time; as
likewise, on the contrary, days are of no service where there is a want of
this fear. For just as in the case of rusted implement, he that rubs them
only with water, though he spend a long time on them, will not rid them of
all that foulness; but he that puts them in a furnace, will make them
presently brighter than even those newly fabricated: so too a soul, stained
with the rust of sin, if it cleanse itself slightly, and in a negligent way, and
be every day repenting, will gain no further advantage. But if it cast itself
into the furnace, as it were, of the fear of God, it will in a very short time
purge all away.

22. Let us not then be procrastinating till tomorrow. For we "know not
what the next day may bring forth;" nor let us say, "we shall conquer this
habit by little and little;" since this little and little will never come to an
end. Wherefore, dismissing that excuse, we should say, "If we do not
reform the practice of swearing today, we will not leave off till we do,
though ten thousand things were to press us; though it were necessary to
die, or to be punished, or to lose all we have; we will not give the devil the
advantage of slackness, nor the pretext of delay." Should God perceive thy
soul inflamed, and thy diligence quickened, then He also Himself will lend
His assistance to thy reformation! Yea, I pray and beseech you, let us be

in earnest, lest we also hear it said of us, "The men of Nineveh shall rise
up, and shall condemn this generation;" for these, when they had once
heard, reformed themselves; but we are not converted after frequent
hearing. These were proficients in every part of virtue, but we in no part.
They when they heard that their city would be overthrown were
affrighted; but we, though we have heard of Hell, are not affrighted: these,
men who did not partake of the instructions of the prophets; we, enjoying
the advantage of perpetual teaching, and of much grace.

23. These things I now speak to you, not as if reproving you for your own
sins, but for the sake of others; for I know full well that by you (as I have
already observed), this law concerning swearing has been accomplished.
But this does not suffice for our safety, unless by teaching we amend
others, since he who produced the one talent, restoring as he did the whole
portion committed to him, was punished, because he had not enriched that
with which he was entrusted. Wherefore, let us not regard this point, that
we ourselves have been set free from this sin; but until we have delivered
others from it, let us not desist; and let every one offer to God ten friends
whom he has corrected; whether thou hast servants, or apprentices: or if
you have neither servants, nor apprentices, you have friends; these do
thou reform. Further, do not make me this reply; "We have banished oaths
for the most part, and we are rarely caught in that snare;" but let even this
rarity of offending be got rid of. If you had lost one piece of gold, would
you not go about to all persons, searching and making enquiry, in order to
find it? This do also with regard to oaths. If you perceive that you have
been cheated out of one oath, weep, lament, as though your whole
substance were lost. Again I say what I did before. Shut up thyself at
home; make it a subject of practice and exercise along with thy wife, thy
children, and domestics. Say to thyself in the first instance, "I must not
put a finger to private or public matters until I have rectified this soul of
mine." If you will thus school your own sons, they too will instruct their
children in turn, and thus this discipline, reaching even to the
consummation and appearing of Christ, will bring all that great reward to
those who go to the root of the matter. If your son has learnt to say,
"Believe me;" he will not be able to go up to the theater, or to enter a
tavern, or to spend his time at dice; for that word, lying upon his mouth
instead of a bridle, will make him however unwilling feel shame and blush.

But if at any time he should appear in these places, it will quickly compel
him to retreat. Suppose some persons laugh. Do thou on the other hand
weep for their transgression! Many also once laughed at Noah whilst he
was preparing the ark; but when the flood came, he laughed at them; or
rather, the just man never laughed at them at all, but wept and bewailed!
When therefore thou seest persons laughing, reflect that those teeth, that
grin now, will one day have to sustain that most dreadful wailing and
gnashing, and that they will remember this same laugh on That Day whilst
they are grinding and gnashing! Then thou too shalt remember this laugh!
How did the rich man laugh at Lazarus! But afterwards, when he beheld
him in Abraham's bosom, he had nothing left to do but to bewail himself!

24. Being mindful then of all these things, be urgent with all, for the
speedy fulfillment of this precept. And tell me not, that you will do this
by little and little; nor put it off till the morrow, for this tomorrow never
finds an end. Forty days have already passed away. Should the Holy
Easter pass away, I will thenceforward pardon no one, nor employ further
admonition, but a commanding authority, and severity not to be despised.
For this apology drawn from custom is of no force. Why may not the thief
as well plead custom, and get free from punishment? Why may not the
murderer and adulterer? Therefore I protest, and give warning to all, that if,
when I have met you in private, and put the matter to the proof (and I will
certainly put it to the proof), I detect any who have not corrected this
vice, I will inflict punishment upon them, by ordering them to be excluded
from the Holy Mysteries; not that they may remain always shut out, but
that having reformed themselves, they may thus enter in, and with a pure
conscience enjoy the Holy Table; for this is to be a partaker of the
Communion! God grant that through the prayers of those who preside
over us, as well as of all the saints, having corrected these and all other
deficiencies, we may obtain the kingdom of heaven through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father,
together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, honor, and adoration, now and
ever, world without end. Amen.

HOMILY 21

On the return of Flavian the Bishop, and the reconciliation of the
Emperor with the city, and with those who had offended in
overthrowing the Statues.

1. TODAY, I shall begin with that very same saying with which I have ever
been used to open my address to you during the season of danger, and
shall say together with you, "Blessed be God," Who hath granted us this
day to celebrate this holy Feast with much joy and gladness; and hath
restored the head to the body, the shepherd to the sheep, the master to the
disciples, the general to the soldiers, the High Priest to the Priests! Blessed
be God, "Who doeth exceeding abundantly above what we ask or think!"
For to us it would have seemed sufficient, had we been but delivered from
the hitherto impending evil; and for this we made all our supplication. But
the God who loveth man, and ever in His giving surpasseth our prayers by
an excess of bounty, hath brought back our Father too, sooner than we
could at all have expected. Who would, indeed, have thought that in so few
days, he would have gone, and have had audience with the Emperor, and
set us free from the calamity, and again come back to us so quickly, as to
be able to anticipate the Holy Passover, and to celebrate it with ourselves?
Behold, however, this event, which was so contrary to expectation, hath
been realized! We have received back our Father; and we enjoy so much
the greater pleasure, inasmuch as we have received him back now beyond
our hopes. For all these things, let us give thanks to the merciful God, and
be amazed at the power, the lovingkindness, the wisdom, and the tender
care which has been manifested on behalf of the city. For the devil had
attempted its entire subversion through the daring crimes committed; but
God, by means of this same calamity, hath adorned the city, the Priest,
and the Emperor; and hath made them all more illustrious.

2. The city hath won renown, because when such a danger had overtaken
her, passing by at once all those who were in power, those who were
surrounded with much wealth, those who possessed great influence with
the Emperor, it fled for refuge to the Church, and to the Priest of God, and
with much faith, rested itself entirely upon the hope which is from above!
Many indeed, after the departure of the common Father, were ready to

terrify those who lay in prison, by saying, "The Emperor does not lay
aside his wrath, but is still more provoked, and is thinking of the utter ruin
of the city." But whilst they were whispering all this, and much more,
they who were then in bonds were not the least intimidated, but upon our
saying, "These things are false, and they are a device of the devil, who
desires to fill you with consternation;" they replied to us," We need no
consolation to be addressed to us; for we know where we have taken
refuge from the first; and upon what hope we have rested ourselves. We
have fixed our safety upon the sacred anchor! We have not entrusted this
to man, but to the Almighty God; therefore we are most assuredly
confident, that the result will be favorable; for it is impossible, truly
impossible, that this hope can ever be confounded!" To how many
crowns, how many encomiums, is this equivalent for our city? How much
of God's favor will it draw down upon us too in our other affairs! For it is
not, indeed it is not a thing belonging to a soul of mean order to be
watchful against the attack of temptations, and to look to God; and
scorning all that is human, to yearn after that Divine aid.

3. The city then hath thus won renown; and the Priest again not less than
the city, for be exposed his life for all; and while there were many things to
hinder him, as the winter, his age, the feast, and not less than these, his
sister, then at her last breath, he raised himself above all these obstacles,
and did not say to himself, "What a thing is this? Our only remaining
sister, she who hath drawn the yoke of Christ along with me, and who
hath been my domestic companion so long, is now at her last breath; and
shall we desert her, and go hence, and not behold her expiring, and uttering
her paring words? But she indeed was praying daily, that we might close
her eyes, and shut and compose her mouth, and attend to all other things
pertaining to the burial; but now in this case, as one deserted, and deprived
of a protector, she will obtain none of these offices from her brother; of
him whom she especially desired to obtain them; but when she gives up
the ghost, she will not see him whom she loved more to have with her than
all others? And will not this be heavier to her than dying many times over?
Yes, although I were far away, would it not be right to come with speed,
and do, and suffer any thing, for the purpose of shewing her this kindness?
And now when I am near, shall I leave her, and taking my departure
abandon her? And how then will she sustain the remainder of her days?"

4. Yet, so far was he from saying any of these things, that he did not even
think of them; but esteeming the fear of God above all the ties of kindred,
he recognized the fact, that as tempests display the pilot, and dangers the
general, so also a time of trial makes the Priest to become manifest. "All
men," saith he, "are eagerly looking on us; the Jews as well as the Greeks;
let us not confound the expectations which these have of us; let us not
overlook so great a shipwreck; but having committed to God all things that
pertain to ourselves, let us venture our life itself too!" Consider, moreover,
the magnanimity of the Priest, and the lovingkindness of God! All those
things which he disregarded, all those he enjoyed; in order that he might
both receive the reward of his readiness, and that he might obtain a greater
pleasure by enjoying them contrary to expectation! He preferred to
celebrate the festival in a foreign place, and far from his own people, for
the sake of the city's safety. But God restored him to us before the
Paschal feast, so as to take a common part with us in the conduct of the
festival; in order that he might have the reward of his choice, and enjoy the
greater gladness! He feared not the season of the year; and there was
summer during the whole period he was traveling. He took not his age into
account; and he dispatched this long journey with just as much ease as if
he had been young and sprightly! He thought not of his sisters decease nor
was enervated by it, and when he returned he found her still alive, and all
things which were disregarded by him, were all obtained!

5. Thus, the priest hath indeed won renown both with God and man! This
transaction hath also adorned the Emperor with a splendor beyond the
diadem! First, in that it was then made apparent that he would grant that
to the priests which he would not to any other; secondly, that he granted
the favor without delay, and quelled his resentment. But that you may
more clearly understand the magnanimity of the Emperor, and the wisdom
of the priest, and more than both these, the lovingkindness of God; allow
me to relate to you a few particulars of the conference which took place.
But what I am now about to relate I learnt from one of those who were
within the palace; for the Father has told us neither much nor little on the
affair; but ever imitating the magnanimity of Paul, he hides his own good
deeds; and to those who on all sides were asking him questions as to what
he said to the Emperor; and how he prevailed upon him; and how he
turned away his wrath entirely, he replied, "We contributed nothing to the

matter, but the Emperor himself (God having softened his heart), even
before we had spoken, dismissed his anger, and quelled his resentment; and
discoursing of the events that had taken place as if some other person had
been insulted, he thus went over all the events that had happened without
anger." But those things which he concealed from humility, God hath
brought to light.

6. And what were these? I will proceed to relate them to you by going a
little farther back in the story. When he went forth from the city, leaving
all in such great despondency, he endured what was far more grievous than
we ourselves suffered, who were in the midst of these calamities. For, in
the first place, meeting in the midst of his journey with those who had
been sent by the Emperor to make inquisition upon the events which had
happened; and learning from them, on what terms they were sent; and
reflecting upon the dreadful events that were in store for the city, the
tumults, the confusion, the flight, the terror, the agony, the perils, he wept
a flood of tears, and his bowels were rent with compassion; for with
fathers, it is usual to grieve much more, when they are not able to be
present with their suffering children; which was just what this most
tender-hearted man now endured; not only lamenting the calamities which
were in reserve for us, but that he was far away from us, whist we were
enduring them. But this was, however, for our safety. For as soon as he
had learned these things from them; more warmly did the fountain of his
tears then gush forth, and he betook himself to God with more fervent
supplication; and spent his nights without sleep, beseeching Him that He
would succor the city, while enduring these things, and make the mind of
the Emperor more placable. And as soon as he came to that great city, and
had entered the royal palace, he stood before the Emperor at a distance, -
speechless, - weeping, - with downcast eyes, - covering his face as if
he himself had been the doer of all the mischief; and this he did, wishing
first to incline him to mercy by his posture, and aspect, and tears; and
then to begin an apology on our behalf; since there is but one hope of
pardon for those who have offended, which is to be silent, and to utter
nothing in defense of what has been done. For he was desirous that one
feeling should be got rid of, and that another should take its place; that
anger should be expelled, and sadness introduced, in order that he might
thus prepare the way for the words of his apology; which indeed actually

took place. And just as Moses going up to the mount, when the people
had offended, stood speechless himself, until God called him, saying, "Let
me alone, and I will blot out this people;" so also did he now act: The
Emperor therefore, when he saw him shedding tears, and bending toward
the ground, himself drew near; and what he really felt on seeing the tears of
the priest, he made evident by the words he addressed to him; for they
were not those of a person provoked or inflamed, but of one in sorrow;
not of one enraged, but rather dejected, and under constraint of extreme
pain.

7. And that this is true, ye will understand when ye hear what were his
words. For he did not say, "What does this mean? Hast thou come heading
an embassy on behalf of impious and abominable men, such as ought not
even to live; on behalf of rebels, of revolutionists, who deserve the utmost
punishment?" But dismissing all words of that sort, he composed a
defense of himself full of respectfulness and dignity; and he enumerated
the benefits, which during the whole time of his reign he had conferred
upon the city; and at each of these be said, "Was it thus I should have
been treated in return for these things? What injuries had I done, that they
should take such revenge? What complaint had they, great or small, that
they must not insult me only, but the deceased also? Was it not sufficient
to wreak their resentment against the living? Yet they thought they were
doing nothing grand, unless they insulted those now in their graves.
Granting that I had injured them, as they suppose; surely it would have
been becoming to spare the dead, who had done them no wrong; for they
could not have the same complaint against them. Did I not ever esteem this
city above every thing, and account it as dearer than my native place? And
was it not a matter of my continual prayers to visit this city; and did I not
make this my oath to all men?"

8. Upon this, the priest sobbing bitterly, and shedding warmer tears, no
longer kept silence: for he saw that the defense of the Emperor was raising
our crime to a still higher amount; but heaving from the bottom of his heart
a deep and bitter sigh, he said, "We must confess, O Emperor, this love
which you have shewn towards our country! We cannot deny it! On this
account, especially, we mourn, that a city thus beloved has been
bewitched by demons; and that we should have appeared ungrateful
towards her benefactor, and have provoked her ardent lover. And although

you were to overthrow; although you were to burn; although you were to
put to death; or whatever else you might do, you would never yet have
taken on us the revenge we deserve. We ourselves have, by anticipation,
inflicted on ourselves what is worse than a thousand deaths! For what can
be more bitter, than when we are found to have unjustly provoked our
benefactor, and one who loved us so much, and the whole world knows it,
and condemns us for the most monstrous ingratitude! If Barbarians had
made an incursion on our city, and razed its walls, and burnt its houses,
and had taken and carried us away captive, the evil had been less. And
why so? but because, whilst you live, and continue such a generous
kindness towards us, there might be a hope that we might again be brought
back to our former condition, and regain a more illustrious liberty. But
now, having been deprived of your favor, and having quenched yore love,
which was a greater security to us than any wall, whom have we left to fly
to? Where else shall we have to look, when we have provoked so benign a
Lord, so indulgent a father? So that while they seem to have committed
offenses of the most intolerable kind, they have on the other hand suffered
the most terrible evils; not daring to look any man in the face; nor being
able to look upon the sun with free eyes; shame every where weighing
down their eyelids, and compelling them to hide their heads! Deprived of
their confidence, they are now in a more miserable condition than any
captives, and undergo the utmost dishonor; and whilst thinking of the
magnitude of their evils, and the height of insolence to which they have
rushed, they can scarce draw breath; inasmuch as they have drawn on their
own heads severer reproaches from all the inhabitants of the world, than
even from him who is seen to have been insulted.

9. But yet, O Emperor, if you are willing, there is a remedy for the wound,
and a medicine for these evils, mighty as they are! Often, indeed, has it
occurred amongst private individuals, that great and insufferable offenses
have become a foundation for great affection. Thus also did it happen in
the case of our human race. For when God made man, and placed him in
Paradise, and held him in much honor; the devil could not bear this his
great prosperity, and envied him, and cast him out from that dignity which
had been granted. But God was so far from forsaking him, that He even
opened Heaven to us instead of Paradise; and in so doing, both shewed His
own lovingkindness, and punished the devil the more severely. So do thou

too now! The demons have lately used all their efforts, that they may
effectually rend from your favor that city which was dearest of all to you.
Knowing this then, demand what penalty you will, but let us not become
outcasts from your former love! Nay, though it is a strange thing, I must
say, display towards us now still greater kindness than ever; and again
write this city's name among the foremost in your love; - if you are
indeed desirous of being revenged upon the demons who were the
instigators of these crimes! For if you pull down, and overturn, and raze
the city, you will be doing those very things which they have long been
desiring. But if you dismiss your anger, and again avow that you love it
even as you did before, you have given them a deadly blow. You have
taken the most perfect revenge upon them by shewing, not only that
nothing whatever has come for them of their evil designs; but that all hath
proved the very opposite of what they wished. And you would be just in
acting thus, and in shewing mercy to a city, which the demons envied on
account of your affection; for if you had not so exceedingly loved her, they
would not have envied her to such a degree! So that even if what I have
asserted is extraordinary, it is nevertheless, true, that what the city hath
suffered, hath been owing to thee, and thy love! What burning, what
devastation, so bitter as those words, which you uttered in your own
defense?

10. You say now, that you have been insulted, and sustained wrongs such
as no Emperor ever yet did. But if you will, O most gracious, most wise,
and most religious Sovereign, this contempt will procure you a crown,
more honorable and splendid than the diadem you wear! For this diadem is
a display of your princely virtue, but it is also a token of the munificence
of him who gave it; but the crown woven from this your humanity will be
entirely your own good work, and that of your own love of wisdom; and
all men will admire you less for the sake of these precious stones, than
they will applaud you for your superiority over this wrath. Were your
Statues thrown down? You have it in your power again to set up others
yet more splendid. For if you remit the offenses of those who have done
you injury, and take no revenge upon them, they will erect a statue to you,
not one in the forum of brass, nor of gold, nor inlaid with gems; but one
arrayed in that robe which is more precious than any material, that of
humanity and tender mercy! Every man will thus set you up in his own

soul; and you will have as many statues, as there are men who now
inhabit, or shall hereafter inhabit, the whole world! For not only we, but
all those who come after us, and their successors, will hear of these things,
and will admire and love you, just as if they themselves had experienced
this kindness!

11. And to shew that I do not speak this in a way of flattery, but that it
will certainly be so, I will relate to you an ancient piece of history, that
you may understand that no armies, nor warlike weapons, nor money, nor
multitude of subjects, nor any other such things are wont to make
sovereigns so illustrious, as wisdom of soul and gentleness. It is related of
the blessed Constantine, that on one occasion, when a statue of himself
had been pelted with stones, and many were instigating him to proceed
against the perpetrators of the outrage; saying, that they had disfigured his
whole face by battering it with stones, he stroked his face with his hand,
and smiling gently, said, "I am quite unable to perceive any wound
inflicted upon my face. The head appears sound, and the face also quite
sound." Thus these persons, overwhelmed with shame, desisted from their
unrighteous counsel.

This saying, even to the present day, all repeat; and length of time hath
neither weakened nor extinguished the memory of such exalted wisdom.
How much more illustrious is such an action, than any number of warlike
trophies! Many and great titles did he build, and many barbarous tribes
did he conquer; not one of which we now remember; but this saying is
repeated over and over again, to the present day; and those who follow us,
as well as those who come after them, will all hear of it. Nor indeed is this
the only admirable thing; that they will hear of it; but that when men
speak of it, they do so with approbation and applause; and those who
hear of it, receive it with the like; and there is no one who, when he has
heard it, is able to remain silent, but each at once cries out, and applauds
the man who uttered it, and prays that innumerable blessings may be his
lot even now deceased. But if amongst men, this saying has gained him so
much honor, how many crowns will he obtain with the merciful God!

12. And why need I speak of Constantine, and other men's examples,
when it were fitting that I should exhort you by considerations nearer
home, and drawn from your own praiseworthy actions. You remember

how but lately, when this feast was near at hand, you sent an epistle to
every part of the world giving orders that the inmates of the prisons
should be set free, and their crimes be pardoned. And as if this were not
sufficient to give proof of your generosity, you said in your letters, "O
that it were possible for me to recall and to restore those who are dead,
and to bring them back to their former state of life!" Remember now these
words. Behold the season of recalling and restoring the deceased, and
bringing them back to former life! For these are indeed already dead, even
before the sentence hath been pronounced; and the city hath now taken up
its tabernacle at the very gates of Hades! Therefore raise it up again, which
you can do without money, without expense, without loss of time or
labor! It is sufficient merely for you to open your lips, and you will
restore to life the city which at present lieth in darkness. Grant now, that
henceforth it may bear an appellation derived from your philanthropy; for
it will not be so much indebted to the kindness of him who first founded
it, as it will be to your sentence. And this is exceedingly reasonable; for he
but gave it its beginning, and departed; but you, when it had grown up and
become great; and when it was fallen, alter all that great prosperity; will
have been its restorer. There would have been nothing so wonderful in
your having delivered it from danger, when enemies had captured, and
barbarians overrun it, as in your now sparing it. That, many of the
Emperors have frequently done; but should you alone accomplish this,
you will be first in doing it, and that beyond all expectation. And the
former of these good deeds, the protection of your subjects, is not at all
wonderful or extraordinary; but is one of those events which are of
continual occurrence; but the latter, the dismissal of wrath after the
endurance of such provocations, is something which surpasses human
nature.

13. Reflect, that the matter now for your consideration is not respecting
this city only, but is one that concerns your own glory; or rather, one that
affects the cause of Christianity in general. Even now the Gentiles, and
Jews, and the whole empire as well as the barbarians, (for these last have
also heard of these events,) are eagerly looking to you, and waiting to see
what sentence you will pronounce with regard to these transactions. And
should you decree a humane and merciful one; all will applaud the
decision, and glorify God, and say one to another, "Heavens! how great is

the power of Christianity, that it restrains and bridles a man who has no
equal upon earth; a sovereign, powerful enough to destroy and devastate
all things; and teaches him to practice such philosophy as one in a private
station had not been likely to display! Great indeed must be the God of
the Christians, who makes angels out of men, and renders them superior to
all the constraining force of our nature!"

14. Nor ought you, assuredly, to entertain that idle fear; nor to bear with
those who say that other cites will become worse, and grow more
contemptuous of authority, if this city goes unpunished. For if you were
unable to take vengeance; and they, after doing these things, had forcibly
defied you; and the power on each side was equally matched; then
reasonably enough might such suspicions be entertained. But if, terrified
and half dead with fear, they run to cast themselves at your feet, through
me; and expect daily nothing else but the pit of slaughter, and are engaged
in common supplications; looking up to heaven and calling upon God to
come to their aid, and to favor this our embassy; and have each given
charge about his private affairs, as if they were at their last gasp; how can
such a fear be otherwise than superfluous? If they had been ordered to be
put to death, they would not have suffered as much as they do now, living
as they have done so many days in fear and trembling; and when the
evening approaches, not expecting to behold the morning; nor when the
day arrives, hoping to reach the evening! Many too have fallen in with
wild beasts, while pursuing their way through desert places, and removing
to untrodden spots; and not men only, but also little children and women;
free born, and of good condition; hiding themselves many days and nights
in caves, and ravines, and holes of the desert! A new mode of captivity
hath indeed befallen the city. Whilst the buildings and walls are standing,
they suffer heavier calamities than when cities have been set on fire!
Whilst no barbarian foe is present, whilst no enemy appears, they are
more wretchedly situated than if actually taken; and the rustling only of a
leaf scares them all every day! And these are matters which are universally
known; so that if all men had seen the city razed to the ground, they
would not have been taught such a lesson of sobriety, as by hearing of the
calamities which have now befallen it. Suppose not, therefore, that other
cities will be made worse in future! Not even if you had overturned other
cities, would you have so effectually corrected them, as now, by this

suspense concerning their fate, having chastised them more severely than
by any punishment!

15. Do not, then, carry this calamity any father; but allow them henceforth
to take breath again. For to punish the guilty, and to exact the penalty for
these deeds, were easy and open to any one; but to spare those who have
insulted you, and to pardon those who have committed offenses
undeserving of pardon, is an act of which only some one or two are
capable; and especially so, where the person treated with indignity is the
Emperor. It is an easy matter to place the city under the subjection of fear;
but to dispose all to be loving subjects; and to persuade them to hold
themselves well affected towards your government; and to offer not only
their common, but individual prayers for your empire; is a work of
difficulty. A monarch might expend his treasures, or put innumerable
troops in motion, or do what else he pleased, but still he would not be able
to draw the affections of so many men towards himself as may now very
easily be done. For they who have been kindly dealt with, and those who
hear of it too, will be well affected towards you, even as the recipients of
the benefit. How much money, how many labors would you not have
expended to win over to yourself the whole world in a short space of time;
and to be able to persuade all those men who are now in existence, as well
as all future generations, to invoke upon your head the same blessings
which they pray for on behalf of their own children! And if you will
receive such a reward from men, how much greater will you have from
God! And this, not merely from the events which are now taking place,
but from those good deeds which shall be performed by others in time to
come. For if ever it should be that an event similar to what has now
occurred should take place, (which God forbid!) and any of those who
have been treated with indignity, should then be consulting about
prosecuting measures against the rioters; your gentleness and moral
wisdom will serve them instead of all other teaching and admonition; and
they will blush and be ashamed, having such an example of wisdom, to
appear inferior. So that in this way you will be an instructor to all
posterity; and you will obtain the palm amongst them, even although they
should attain to the highest point of moral wisdom! For it is not the same
thing for a person to set the first example of such meekness him-sell and
by looking at others, to imitate the good actions they have performed. On

this account, whatever philanthropy, or meekness, those who come after
you may display, you will enjoy the reward along with them; for he who
provides the root, must be considered the source of the fruits. For this
reason, no one can possibly now share with you the reward that will
follow your generosity, since the good deed hath been entirely your own.
But you will share the reward of all those who shall come after, if any
such persons should make their appearance; and it will be in your power
to have an equal share in the merit of the good work along with them, and
to carry off a portion as great as teachers have with scholars. And
supposing that no such person should come into being, the tribute of
commendation and applause will be accumulating to you throughout every
age.

16. For consider, what it is for all posterity to hear it reported, that when
so great a city had become obnoxious to punishment and vengeance, that
when all were terrified, when its generals, its magistrates and judges, were
all in horror and alarm, and did not dare to utter a word on behalf of the
wretched people; a single old man, invested with the priesthood of God,
came and moved the heart of the Monarch by his mere aspect and
intercourse; and that the favor which he bestowed upon no other of his
subjects, he granted to this one old man, being actuated by a reverence for
God's laws! For in this very thing, O Emperor, that I have been sent
hither on this embassy, the city hath done you no small honor; for they
have thus pronounced the best and the most honorable judgment on you,
which is, that you respect the priests of God, however insignificant they
may be, more than any office placed under your authority!

17. But at the present time I have come not from these only, but rather
from One who is the common Lord of angels and men, to address these
words to your most merciful and most gentle soul, "if ye forgive men their
debts, your heavenly Father will forgive you your trespasses." Remember
then that Day when we shall all give an account of our actions! Consider
that if you have sinned in any respect, you will be able to wipe away all
offenses by this sentence and by this determination, and that without
difficulty and without toil. Some when they go on an embassy, bring gold,
and silver, and other gifts of that kind. But I am come into your royal
presence with the sacred laws; and instead of all other gifts, I present
these; and I exhort you to imitate your Lord, who whilst He is daily

insulted by us, unceasingly ministers His blessings to all! And do not
confound our hopes, nor defeat our promises. For I wish you withal to
understand, that if it be your resolution to be reconciled, and to restore
your former kindness to the city, and to remit this just displeasure, I shall
go back with great confidence. But if you determine to cast off the city, I
shall not only never return to it, nor see its soil again, but I shall in future
utterly disown it, and enroll myself a member of some other city; for God
forbid that I should ever belong to that country, which you, the most mild
and merciful of all men, refuse to admit to peace and reconciliation!

18. Having said this, and much more to the same effect, he so overcame the
Emperor, that the same thing occurred which once happened to Joseph.
For just as he, when he beheld his brethren, longed to shed tears, but
restrained his feeling, in order that he might not spoil the part which he
was playing; even so did the Emperor mentally weep, but did not let it be
seen, for the sake of those who were present. He was not, however, able
to conceal the feeling at the close of the conference; but betrayed himself,
though against his will. For after this speech was finished, no further
words were necessary, but he gave utterance to one only sentiment, which
did him much more honor than the diadem. And what was that? "How,"
said he, "can it be any thing wonderful or great, that we should remit our
anger against those who have treated us with indignity; we, who ourselves
are but men; when the Lord of the universe, having come as He did on
earth, and having been made a servant for us, and crucified by those who
had experienced His kindness, besought the Father on behalf of His
crucifiers, saying, "Forgive them, for they know not what they do? "
What marvel, then, if we also should forgive our fellow-servants! And that
these words were not a pretense was proved by all that followed. And not
the least, that particular circumstance which I am now about to mention;
for this our priest, when he would have remained there, and celebrated the
feast together with himself, he urged, though contrary to what he would
have wished, - to use all speed, and diligence, to present himself to his
fellow-citizens. "I know," said he, "that their souls are still agitated; and
that there are many relics of the calamity left. Go, give them consolation!
If they see the helmsman, they will no longer remember the storm that has
passed away; but all recollection of these sorrowful events will be
effaced!" And when the Priest was urgent, entreating him to send his own

son, he, wishing to give the most satisfactory proof of his having entirely
blotted out from his soul every wrathful feeling, answered; "Pray that
these hindrances may be taken out of the way; that these wars may be put
an end to; and then I will certainly come myself."

19. What could be gentler than such a soul? Let the Gentiles henceforward
be ashamed; or rather, instead of being ashamed, let them be instructed;
and leaving their native error, let them come back to the strength of
Christianity, having learned what our philosophy is, from the example of
the Emperor and of the Priest! For our most pious Emperor stayed not at
this point; but when the Bishop had left the city, and come over the sea,
he dispatched thither also certain persons, being most solicitous and
painstaking to prevent any waste of time lest the city should be thus
deprived of half its pleasure, whilst the bishop was celebrating the feast
beyond its walls. Where is the gracious father that would have so busied
himself on behalf of those who had insulted him? But I must mention
another circumstance that redounds to the praise of the just man. For
when he had accomplished this, he did not make it his endeavor, as any
one else might have done, who was fond of glory, to deliver those letters
himself, which were to set us free from the state of dejection in which we
were; but since he was journeying at too slow a rate for this, he thought
proper to send forward another person in his stead; one among those who
were skilled in horsemanship, to be the bearer of the good news to the
city; lest its sadness should be prolonged by the tardiness of his arrive.
For the only thing he earnestly coveted was this; not that he might come
himself, bringing these favorable tidings, so full of all that is delightful, but
that our country might as soon as possible breathe freely again.

20. What therefore ye then did, in decking the forum with garlands; lighting
lamps, spreading couches of green leaves before the shops, and keeping
high festival, as if the city had just come into being, this do ye, although in
another manner, throughout all time; - being crowned, not with flowers,
but with virtue; - kindling in your souls the light which comes from good
works; rejoicing with a spiritual gladness. And let us never fail to give God
thanks continually for all these things, not only that he hath freed us from
these calamities, but that he also pertained them to happen; and let us
acknowledge his abundant goodness! for by both these has He adorned our
city. Now all these things according to the prophetic saying, "Declare ye

to your children; and let your children tell their children; and their children
again another generation." So that all who shall be hereafter, even to the
consummation, learning this act of God's lovingkindness towards the city,
may call us blessed, in having enjoyed such a favor; - may marvel at our
Sovereign, who raised up the city when it was so grievously falling; - and
may themselves be profited, being stimulated to piety by means of all
which has happened! For the history of what has lately happened to us,
will have power to profit not only ourselves, if we constantly remember
it, but also those who shall come after us. All these things then being
considered, let us always give thanks to God who loveth man; not merely
for our deliverance from these fearful evils, but for their being permitted to
overtake us, - learning this from the divine Scriptures, as well as from the
late events that have befallen us; that He ever disposes all things for our
advantage, with that lovingkindness which is His attribute, which God
grant, that we may continually enjoy, and so may obtain the kingdom of
heaven, in Christ Jesus our Lord; to whom be glory and dominion for ever
and ever. Amen.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE DIGITAL LIBRARY?
The Library consists of books and other literature of enduring value to the
Christian community. Our goal since the beginning has been to "make the
words of the wise available to all -inexpensively." We have had in mind
the student, teacher, pastor, missionary, evangelist and church worker who
needs a high quality reference library, one that is portable, practical and
low in cost.

ON WHAT BASIS WERE THEY S ELECTED?
Volumes in the Library have been added based on several criteria:
usefulness, user request, breadth of content or reputation. This has meant
that the collection is eclectic and may include works that contain positions
with which we at AGES Software do not agree. This paradox is consistent
with our design, however: any useful library consists of books on a wide
variety of subjects and sometimes includes information for reference
purposes only. The AGES Digital Library hopefully will reflect - as its
components are released - the necessary breadth and depth for a solid
personal library.

HOW WERE THESE VOLUMES PREPARED?
Most of the books and documents have been scanned or typed from
works that have entered the public domain. Some have been reproduced by
special arrangement with the current publisher or holder of the copyright.
They have been put in a format that can be readily used by computer
users everywhere.

ARE THESE EXACT COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL WORKS?
Usually not. In the process of preparing the Library, we at AGES
Software have taken the liberty to make certain edits to the text. As we
discovered errors in spelling, certain archaic forms, typographical mistakes
or omissions in the original we have done our best to correct them. Our
intention has been to remove anything that might obscure the meaning or

otherwise detract from the usefulness of a book for the modern reader. We
have, however, attempted to retain the essential content and thoughts of
the original - even when we found ourselves in disagreement.

WHY IS THE DIGITAL LIBRARY COPYRIGHTED?
While much of the content is in the public domain, the transcription, form
and edits of these works took many people many hours to accomplish.
We ask each purchaser to respect this labor and refrain from giving away
copies of this or any volume of the Library without written permission
from AGES Software. Our policy, however, is to work with each
individual or organization to see that the price of Digital Library volumes
not be a hindrance in their reaching the hands of those who need them. If
price is an obstacle, please contact us at the address above and present
your situation.
