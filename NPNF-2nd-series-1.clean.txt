THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

TRANSLATED WITH PROLEGOMENA AND NOTES

By

THE REV. ARTHUR CUSHMAN McGIFFERT, PH.D.,

PROFESSOR OF CHURCH HISTORY IN LANE THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY, ciNcINNAT1.

PRE FA C E.

THE present translation of the Church History of Eusebius has been made from Heinichen's
second edition of the Greek text, but variant readings have been adopted without hesitation
whenever they have approved themselves to my judgment.
In all such cases the variation from
Heinichen's text has been indicated in the notes. A simple revision of Cruse's English version
was originally proposed, but a brief examination of it was sufficient to convince me that a satis
factory revision would be an almost hopeless task, and that nothing short of a new and indepen
dent translation ought to be undertaken.
In the preparation of that translation invaluable
assistance has been rendered by my father, the Rev. Joseph N. McGiffert, D.D., for whose help
and counsel I desire thus publicly to give expression to my profound gratitude. The entire
translation has been examined by him and owes much to his timely suggestions and criticisms;
while the translation itself of a considerable portion of the work (Bks. V-VIII. and the Martyrs
of Palestine) is from his hand. The part thus rendered by him I have carefully revised for the
purpose of securing uniformity in style and expression throughout the entire work, and I there
As to the
fore hold myself alone responsible for it as well as for the earlier and later books.
principle upon which the translation has been made, little need be said. The constant endeavor
has been to reproduce as nearly as possible, both the substance and form of the original, and
in view of the peculiar need of accuracy in such a work as the present, it has seemed better in
doubtful cases to run the risk of erring in the direction of over-literalness rather than in that of
undue license.

A word of explanation in regard to the notes which accompany the text may not be out of
place.
In view of the popular character of the series of which the present volume forms a part, it
seemed important that the notes should contain much supplementary information in regard to
persons, places, and events mentioned in the text which might be quite superfluous to the profes
sional historian as well as to the student enjoying access to libraries rich in historical and biblio
graphical material, and I have therefore not felt justified in confining myself to such questions as
might interest only the critical scholar.
Requested by the general editor to make the work in
some sense a general history of, or historical commentary upon, the first three centuries of the
Christian Church, I have ventured to devote considerable space to a fuller presentation of various
subjects but briefly touched upon or merely referred to by Eusebius.
At the same time my chief
endeavor has been, by a careful study of difficult and disputed points, to do all that I could for
their elucidation, and thus to perform as faithfully as possible the paramount duty of a commen
tator. The number and fulness of the notes needed in such a work must of course be matter of
dispute, but annoyed as I have repeatedly been by the fragmentary character of the annotations
in the existing editions of the work, I have been anxious to avoid that defect, and have there
fore passed by no passage which seemed to me to need discussion, nor consciously evaded any
difficulty.
Working with historical students constantly in mind I have felt it due to them to for
tify all my statements by references to the authorities upon which they have been based, and to
indicate at the same time with sufficient fullness the sources whose examination a fuller investi

cial reference at this point to Smith and Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography which has
been constantly at my side, and to the first and second volumes of Schaff's Church History,
whose bibliographies have been especially serviceable. Many of Walesius' notes have been found
very suggestive and must always remain valuable in spite of the great advance made in historical
knowledge since his day.
Richardson's
Bibliographical Synopsis, published as a supplement to the Ante-Nicene Library, did not come
into my hands until the greater part of the work was completed.
In the preparation of the notes
upon the latter portion it proved helpful, and its existence has enabled me throughout the work
to omit extended lists of books which it would otherwise have been necessary to give.

For the commentary of Heinichen less can be said.

It was my privilege some three years ago to study portions of the fourth and fifth books of
Eusebius' Church History with Professor Adolf Harnack in his Seminar at Marburg.
Especial
thanks are due for the help and inspiration gained from that eminent scholar, and for the light
thrown by him upon many difficult passages in those portions of the work.

It gives me pleasure also to express my obligation to Dr. Isaac G. Hall, of New York, and to
Dr. E. C. Richardson, of Hartford, for information furnished by them in regard to certain edi
tions of the History, also to the Rev. Charles R. Gillett, Librarian of Union Theological Seminary,
and to the Rev. J. H. Dulles, Librarian of Princeton Theological Seminary, for their kindness
in granting me the privileges of the libraries under their charge, and for their unfailing cour
tesy shown me in many ways. To Mr. James McDonald, of Shelbyville, Ky., my thanks are due
for his translation of the Testimonies for and against Eusebius, printed at the close of the Pro
legomena, and to Mr. F. E. Moore, of New Albany, Ind., for assistance rendered in connection
with the preparation of the indexes.

CHAPTER I.

THE LIFE of Eusebius.

§ 1.

Sources and Literature.

AcAcius, the pupil and successor of Eusebius in the bishopric of Caesarea, wrote a life of the latter (Socr.
A. E. II. 4) which is unfortunately lost. He was a man of ability (Sozomen H. E. III. 2, IV. 23) and had
exceptional opportunities for producing a full and accurate account of Eusebius' life; the disappearance of his
work is therefore deeply to be regretted.

Numerous notices of Eusebius are found in the works of Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, Athanasius, Jerome,
and other writers of his own and subsequent ages, to many of which references will be made in the following
pages.
A collection of these notices, made by Walesius, is found in English translation on p. 57 sq. of this
volume. The chief source for a knowledge of Eusebius' life and character is to be found in his own works. These
will be discussed below, on p. 26 sq. Of the numerous modern works which treat at greater or less length of
the life of Eusebius I shall mention here only those which I have found most valuable.

the best and most exhaustive treatment of the life and writings of Eusebius that has been written.

The student may be referred finally to all the larger histories of the Church (e.g. Schaff, vol. III. 871 sqq. and

1034 sq.), which contain more or less extended accounts of Eusebius.

§ 2.

Eusebius' Birth and Training.

His Life in Caesarea until the Outbreak of the

Persecution.

Our author was commonly known among the ancients as Eusebius of Caesarea or Eusebius
Pamphili. The former designation arose from the fact that he was bishop of the church in
Caesarea for many years; the latter from the fact that he was the intimate friend and devoted
admirer of Pamphilus, a presbyter of Caesarea and a martyr. Some such specific appellation was
B 2.

PROLEGOMENA.

necessary to distinguish him from others of the same name.
Smith and Wace's Dictionary of
Christian Biography mentions 137 men of the first eight centuries who bore the name Eusebius,
and of these at least forty were contemporaries of our author. The best known among them
were Eusebius of Nicomedia (called by Arius the brother of Eusebius of Caesarea), Eusebius of
Emesa, and Eusebius of Samosata.

His birthplace cannot be determined with certainty.

The exact date of our author's birth is unknown to us, but his socc/esiastica/ History contains

attempted to revive again in his day (kaff juás) the heresy of Artemon.
But Paul of Samosata was
deposed from the episcopate of Antioch in 272, and was condemned as a heretic at least as early
as 268, so that Eusebius must have been born before the latter date, if his words are to be strictly

time (kaff juás).
But Dionysius was bishop from 247 or 248 to 265, and therefore if Eusebius'
words are to be interpreted strictly here as in the former case, he must have been born before
265. On the other hand, inasmuch as his death occurred about 340, we cannot throw his birth

conclusively that Eusebius was alive in their day, for his words may have been used in a loose
sense.
But in H. E. VII. 26, just before proceeding to give an account of Paul of Samosata, he

and we shall consequently be safe in concluding that Eusebius was born not far from the year
26o A.D.
The fact that he is called
"Eusebius the Palestinian" by Marcellus (Euse'. Jih. adv. Marce//, I. 4), Basil (Lib. ad. Amphis.
de Soir. Sancto, c. 29), and others, does not prove that he was a Palestinian by birth; for the
epithet may be used to indicate merely his place of residence (he was bishop of Caesarea in
Palestine for many years).
Moreover, the argument urged by Stein and Lightfoot in support of
his Palestinian birth, namely, that it was customary to elect to the episcopate of any church
a native of the city in preference to a native of some other place, does not count for much.
All
that seems to have been demanded was that a man should have been already a member of the
particular church over which he was to be made bishop, and even this rule was not universal (see
Bingham's Antiquities, II. Io, 2 and 3). The fact that he was bishop of Caesarea therefore would
at most warrant us in concluding only that he had made his residence in Caesarea for some time
Nevertheless, although neither of these arguments proves
previous to his election to that office.
his Palestinian birth, it is very probable that he was a native of that country, or at least of that
section. He was acquainted with Syriac as well as with Greek, which circumstance taken in con
nection with his ignorance of Latin (see below, p. 47) points to the region of Syria as his birth
Moreover, we learn from his own testimony that he was in Caesarea while still a youth
place.
(Piła Constantini, I. 19), and in his epistle to the church of Caesarea (see below, p. 16) he says
that he was taught the creed of the Caesarean church in his childhood (or at least at the begin
ning of his Christian life: év to karmy fore), and that he accepted it at baptism.
It would seem
therefore that he must have lived while still a child either in Caesarea itself, or in the neighbor
Although no one therefore (except Theodorus Metochita of
hood, where its creed was in use.
the fourteenth century, in his Cap. Misce//, 17; Migne, Patr. Zaf. CXLIV. 949) directly states
that Eusebius was a Palestinian by birth, we have every reason to suppose him such.

His parents are entirely unknown.

Nicephorus Callistus (//. F. VI. 37) reports that his

it is extremely unlikely, in the face of the silence of Eusebius himself and of all other writers,
It is far more probable that the relationship was later assumed to account for the
that it is true.
Arius, in an epistle addressed to Eusebius of Nicomedia (con
close intimacy of the two men.
It is
tained in Theodoret's Hist. Eccles. I. 5), calls Eusebius of Caesarea the latter's brother.
objected to this that Eusebius of Nicomedia refers to Eusebius of Caesarea on one occasion as his

"master" (roi Öeoritórow pov, in his epistle to Paulinus contained in Theodoret's Hist. Eccles.
I. 6), and that on the other hand Eusebius of Caesarea calls Eusebius of Nicomedia, "the great
Eusebius " (AEuses. Zió. ado. A/arce/. I. 4), both of which expressions seem inconsistent with
brotherhood.
Lightfoot justly remarks that neither the argument itself nor the objections carry
much weight. The term đêeAbós may well have been used to indicate merely theological or
ecclesiastical association, while on the other hand, brotherhood would not exclude the form of
expression employed by each in speaking of the other. Of more weight is the fact that neither
Eusebius himself nor any historian of that period refers to such a relationship, and also the
unlikelihood that two members of one family should bear the same name.

From Eusebius' works we gather that he must have received an extensive education both in
Although his immense erudition was
secular philosophy and in Biblical and theological science.
doubtless the result of wide and varied reading continued throughout life, it is highly probable
that he acquired the taste for such reading in his youth. Who his early instructors were we do
not know, and therefore cannot estimate the degree of their influence over him.
As he was a
man, however, who cherished deep admiration for those whom he regarded as great and good
men, and as he possessed an unusually acquisitive mind and a pliant disposition, we should
naturally suppose that his instructors must have possessed considerable influence over him, and
that his methods of study in later years must have been largely molded by their example and
precept. We see this exemplified in a remarkable degree in the influence exerted over him by
Pamphilus, his dearest friend, and at the same time the preceptor, as it were, of his early man
hood.
Certainly this great bibliopholist must have done much to strengthen Eusebius' natural
taste for omnivorous reading, and the opportunities afforded by his grand library for the cultiva
tion of such a taste were not lost. To the influence of Pamphilus, the devoted admirer and

Eusebius showed for that illustrious Father, a respect to which we owe one of the most delightful

Lightfoot and others are apparently inclined to accept his conclusion.
But, as Stroth remarks
(Eusebii Kirchengeschichte, p. xix), all that Eusebius says is that he had heard Dorotheus
expound the Scriptures in the church (rotorov perptos ràs ypadās étri tiss ékkAmorias buryoupévov
karmkoúrapev), that is, that he had heard him preach. To conclude from this statement that
he was a pupil of Dorotheus is certainly quite unwarranted.

Stroth's suggestion that he probably enjoyed the instruction of Meletius for seven years during
the persecution rests upon no good ground, for the passage which he relies upon to sustain his
opinion (H. E. VII. 32. 28) says only that Eusebius "observed Meletius well" (karevojoapsev)
during those seven years.

In Caesarea Eusebius was at one time a presbyter of the church, as we may gather from his
words in the epistle to that church already referred to, where, in speaking of the creed, he says,

train of the Emperor Diocletian.

time that Eusebius first saw Constantine in Caesarea, when he was either on his way to Egypt, or
on his way back (see Tillemont's Hist, des Emp., IV. p. 34).

During these years of quiet, before the great persecution of Diocletian, which broke out in
303 A.D., Eusebius' life must have been a very pleasant one.
Pamphilus' house seems to have
been a sort of rendezvous for Christian scholars, perhaps a regular divinity school; for we learn
from Eusebius' Martyrs in Palestine (Cureton's edition, pp. 13 and 14) that he and a number of
others, including the martyr Apphianus, were living together in one house at the time of the
persecution, and that the latter was instructed in the Scriptures by Pamphilus and acquired from
him virtuous habits and conduct. The great library of Pamphilus would make his house a
natural center for theological study, and the immense amount of work which was done by him,
or under his direction, in the reproduction of copies of the Holy Scriptures, of Origen's works
(see Jerome's de vir. ill. 75 and 81, and contra Rus. I. 9), and in other literary employments of
the same kind, makes it probable that he had gathered about him a large circle of friends and
students who assisted him in his labors and profited by his counsel and instruction.
Amidst
these associations Eusebius passed his early manhood, and the intellectual stimulus thus given
him doubtless had much to do with his future career. He was above all a literary man, and
remained such to the end of his life. The pleasant companionships of these days, and the mutual
interest and sympathy which must have bound those fellow-students and fellow-disciples of
Pamphilus very close together, perhaps had much to do with that broad-minded spirit of sym
pathy and tolerance which so characterized Eusebius in later years. He was always as far as
possible from the character of a recluse. He seems ever to have been bound by very strong ties
to the world itself and to his fellow-men. Had his earlier days been filled with trials and hard
ships, with the bitterness of disappointed hopes and unfulfilled ambitions, with harsh experiences
of others' selfishness and treachery, who shall say that the whole course of his life might not have
been changed, and his writings have exhibited an entirely different spirit from that which is now
one of their greatest charms? Certainly he had during these early years in Caesarea large
opportunities for cultivating that natural trait of admiration for other men, which was often so
strong as to blind him even to their faults, and that natural kindness which led him to see good
wherever it existed in his Christian brethren. At the same time these associations must have had
considerable influence in fostering the apologetic temper. The pursuits of the little circle were
apparently exclusively Christian, and in that day when Christianity stood always on its defense,
it would naturally become to them a sacred duty to contribute to that defense and to employ
all their energies in the task.
It has been remarked that the apologetic temper is very noticeable

with this habit of thought, but certainly those years with Pamphilus and his friends in Caesarea
must have emphasized and developed it.

Another characteristic which Pamphilus and the circle that surrounded him doubtless did
something to develop in our author was a certain superiority to the trammels of mere traditionalism,
or we might perhaps better say that they in some measure checked the opposite tendency of

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF EUSEBIUS.

slavishness to the traditional which seems to have been natural to him.
Pamphilus' deep rever
ence for Origen proclaims him at once superior to that kind of narrow conservatism which led
many men as learned and doubtless as conscientious as himself to pass severe and unconditional
condemnation upon Origen and all his teaching. The effect of championing his cause must have
fostered in this little circle, which was a very hotbed of Origenism, a contempt for the narrow
and unfair judgments of mere traditionalists, and must have led them to seek in some degree the
truth solely for its own sake, and to become in a measure careless of its relation to the views of
any school or church.
It could hardly be otherwise than that the free and fearless spirit of
Origen should leave its impress through his writings upon a circle of followers so devoted to him
as were these Caesarean students. Upon the impressionable Eusebius these influences necessarily
operated. And yet he brought to them no keen speculative powers, no deep originality such as
His was essentially an acquisitive, not a productive mind, and hence
Origen himself possessed.
it was out of the question that he should become a second Origen.
It was quite certain that
Origen's influence over him would weaken somewhat his confidence in the traditional as such, -
a confidence which is naturally great in such minds as his, - but at the same time would do
little to lessen the real power of the past over him. He continued to get his truth from others,
from the great men of the past with whom he had lived and upon whose thought he had feasted.
All that he believed he had drawn from them ; he produced nothing new for himself, and his
creed was a traditional creed. And yet he had at the same time imbibed from his surroundings
the habit of questioning and even criticising the past, and, in spite of his abiding respect for it,
had learned to feel that the voice of the many is not always the voice of truth, and that the
widely and anciently accepted is sometimes to be corrected by the clearer sight of a single man.
Though he therefore depended for all he believed so completely upon the past, his associations
had helped to free him from a slavish adherence to all that a particular school had accepted, and
had made him in some small measure an eclectic in his relations to doctrines and opinions of
earlier generations. A notable instance of this eclecticism on his part is seen in his treatment of
the Apocalypse of John. He felt the force of an almost universal tradition in favor of its apos
tolic origin, and yet in the face of that he could listen to the doubts of Dionysius, and could be
led by his example, in a case where his own dissatisfaction with the book acted as an incentive,
almost, if not quite, to reject it and to ascribe it to another John.
Instances of a similar mode of
conduct on his part are quite numerous.
While he is always a staunch apologist for Christianity,
he seldom, if ever, degenerates into a mere partisan of any particular school or sect.

One thing in fact which is particularly noticeable in Eusebius' works is the comparatively
small amount of time and space which he devotes to heretics.
With his wide and varied learn
ing and his extensive acquaintance with the past, he had opportunities for successful heresy

hunting such as few possessed, and yet he never was a heresy hunter in any sense.
prising when we remember what a fascination this employment had for so many scholars of his
own age, and when we realize that his historical tastes and talents would seem to mark him out
as just the man for that kind of work. May it not be that the lofty spirit of Origen, animating
that Caesarean school, had something to do with the happy fact that he became an apologist
instead of a mere polemic, that he chose the honorable task of writing a history of the Church
instead of anticipating Epiphanius' Panarium ?

It was not that he was not alive to the evils of heresy. He shared with nearly all good church
men of his age an intense aversion for those who, as he believed, had corrupted the true Gospel of

they to see any good in a man whom he looked upon as a real heretic, or to do justice in any degree
to the error which he taught.
His condemnations of heretics in his Church History are most
severe.
Language is hardly strong enough to express his aversion for them. And yet, although
he is thus most thoroughly the child of his age, the difference between him and most of his
contemporaries is very apparent. He mentions these heretics only to dismiss them with dis

approval or condemnation. He seldom, if ever, discusses and refutes their views. His interests
lie evidently in other directions; he is concerned with higher things. A still more strongly
marked difference between himself and many churchmen of his age lies in his large liberality
towards those of his own day who differed with him in minor points of faith, and his comparative
indifference to the divergence of views between the various parties in the Church.
In all this we
believe is to be seen not simply the inherent nature of the man, but that nature as trained in the
school of Pamphilus, the disciple of Origen.

§ 3.

The Persecution of Diocletian.

In this delightful circle and engaged in such congenial tasks, the time must have passed very
happily for Eusebius, until, in 303, the terrible persecution of Diocletian broke upon the Church
almost like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. The causes of the sudden change of policy on
Diocletian's part, and the terrible havoc wrought in the Church, it is not my intention to discuss
here (see below, Bk. VIII. chap. 2, note 3 sq.). We are concerned with the persecution only in
so far as it bears upon the present subject.
In the first year of the persecution Procopius, the
first martyr of Palestine, was put to death at Caesarea (Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine, Cureton's
ed. p. 4), and from that time on that city, which was an important Christian center, was the
scene of a tempest which raged with greater or less violence, and with occasional cessations, for
Eusebius himself was an eyewitness of many martyrdoms there, of which he gives
seven years.
us an account in his Martyrs of Palestine. The little circle which surrounded Pamphilus did not
escape.
In the third year of the persecution (Mars of Pal. p. 12 sq.) a youth named Apphianus,
or Epiphanius (the former is given in the Greek text, the latter in the Syriac), who "resided in
the same house with us, confirming himself in godly doctrine, and being instructed by that per
fect martyr, Pamphilus " (as Eusebius says), committed an act of fanatical daring which caused
his arrest and martyrdom.
It seems that without the knowledge of his friends, concealing his
design even from those who dwelt in the same house with him, he laid hold of the hand of the
governor, Arbanus, who was upon the point of sacrificing, and endeavored to dissuade him from
His arrest was of course the natural consequence,
offering to "lifeless idols and wicked devils."
and he had the glory of witnessing a good profession and suffering a triumphant death.
Although
Eusebius speaks with such admiration of his conduct, it is quite significant of the attitude of him
self, and of most of the circle of which he was one, that Apphianus felt obliged to conceal his
purpose from them. He doubtless feared that they would not permit him to perform the rash
act which he meditated, and we may conclude from that, that the circle in the main was gov
erned by the precepts of good common sense, and avoided that fanaticism which so frequently

is true that he speaks with admiration of
Apphianus' conduct, and in H. E. VIII. 5, of the equally rash procedure of a Nicomedian Chris
tian ; but that does not imply that he considered their course the wisest one, and that he would
not rather recommend the employment of all proper and honorable precautions for the preserva
tion of life.
Indeed, in H. E. IV. 15, he speaks with evident approval of the prudent course pur

sion, and with manifest disapproval of the rash act of the Phrygian Quintus, who presumptuously

sound Christian sense to advocate any such fanaticism, or to practice it himself, as is plain enough
from the fact that he was not arrested until the fifth year of the persecution.
This unhealthy
temper of mind in the midst of persecution was indeed almost universally condemned by the
wisest men of the Church, and yet the boldness and the very rashness of those who thus voluntarily
and needlessly threw their lives away excited widespread admiration and too often a degree

It

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF EUSEBIU.S.

of commendation which served only to promote a wider growth of the same unhealthy senti
ment.

In the fifth year of the persecution Pamphilus was arrested and thrown into prison, where he
remained for two years, when he finally, in the seventh year of the persecution, suffered martyr
dom with eleven others, some of whom were his disciples and members of his own household.
(Pal. Mart. Cureton's ed. p. 36 sq.; H. E. App. chap. 11.)
During the two years of Pam
philus' imprisonment Eusebius spent a great deal of time with him, and the two together com
posed five books of an Apology for Origen, to which Eusebius afterward added a sixth (see below,
p. 36).
Danz (p. 37) assumes that Eusebius was imprisoned with Pamphilus, which is not an
unnatural supposition when we consider how much they must have been together to compose the

Apology as they did.
in the face of Eusebius' own silence it is safer perhaps to assume (with most historians) that he
simply visited Pamphilus in his prison. How it happened that Pamphilus and so many of his
followers were imprisoned and martyred, while Eusebius escaped, we cannot tell.
In his Martyrs
of Palestine, chap. 11, he states that Pamphilus was the only one of the company of twelve martyrs
that was a presbyter of the Caesarean church; and from the fact that he nowhere mentions the
martyrdom of others of the presbyters, we may conclude that they all escaped.
It is not sur
prising, therefore, that Eusebius should have done the same.
Nevertheless, it is somewhat
difficult to understand how he could come and go so frequently without being arrested and

authorities whose influence procured his safety.
This supposition finds some support in the fact
that he had made the acquaintance of Constantine (the Greek in Vita Const. I. 19 has tyvouev,
which implies, as Danz remarks, that he not only saw, but that he became acquainted with Con
stantine) some years before in Caesarea. He could hardly have made his acquaintance unless
he had some friend among the high officials of the city.
Influential family connections may
account in part also for the position of prominence which he later acquired at the imperial court

the faith during the terrible persecution, or that he committed some other questionable and com
promising act of concession, and thus escaped martyrdom.
In support of this is urged the fact
that in 335, at the council of Tyre, Potamo, bishop of Heraclea, in Egypt, addressed Eusebius in
the following words: "Dost thou sit as judge, O Eusebius; and is Athanasius, innocent as he

during the persecution? And I lost an eye in behalf of the truth, but thou appearest to have
received no bodily injury, neither hast thou suffered martyrdom, but thou hast remained alive
with no mutilation. How wast thou released from prison unless thou didst promise those that
put upon us the pressure of persecution to do that which is unlawful, or didst actually do it?" .
Eusebius, it seems, did not deny the charge, but simply rose in anger and dismissed the council
with the words, "If ye come hither and make such accusations against us, then do your accusers

speak the truth.
It must be noticed, however, that Potamo does not directly charge Eusebius
Haer. LXVIII. 8).
with dishonorable conduct, he simply conjectures that he must have acted dishonorably in order
to escape punishment; as if every one who was imprisoned with Potamo must have suffered as
he did
As Stroth suggests, it is quite possible that his peculiarly excitable and violent tempera
ment was one of the causes of his own loss. He evidently in any case had no knowledge of
unworthy conduct on Eusebius' part, nor had any one else so far as we can judge.
For in that
age of bitter controversy, when men's characters were drawn by their opponents in the blackest
lines, Eusebius must have suffered at the hands of the Athanasian party if it had been known
Athanasius himself refers to this incident
that he had acted a cowardly part in the persecution.
(Contra Arian. VIII. 1), but he only says that Eusebius was "accused of sacrificing," he does

IO

PROLEGOMENA.

not venture to affirm that he did sacrifice; and thus it is evident that he knew nothing of such
an act.
Moreover, he never calls Eusebius "the sacrificer," as he does Asterius, and as he
would have been sure to do had he possessed evidence which warranted him in making the
accusation (cf. Lightfoot, p. 311).
Still further, Eusebius' subsequent election to the epis
copate of Caesarea, where his character and his conduct during the persecution must have
been well known, and his appointment in later life to the important see of Antioch, forbid the
supposition that he had ever acted a cowardly part in time of persecution. And finally, it is
psychologically impossible that Eusebius could have written works so full of comfort for, and
sympathy with, the suffering confessors, and could have spoken so openly and in such strong
terms of condemnation of the numerous defections that occurred during the persecution, if he

protected him without any act of compromise on his part; or, supposing him to have been
imprisoned with Potamo, it may be, as Lightfoot suggests, that the close of the persecution
brought him his release as it did so many others.
For it would seem natural to refer that
imprisonment to the latter part of the persecution, when in all probability he visited Egypt, which
was the home of Potamo. We must in any case vindicate Eusebius from the unfounded charge
of cowardice and apostasy; and we ask, with Cave, "If every accusation against any man at any
time were to be believed, who would be guiltless?"

From his History and his Martyrs in Palestine we learn that Eusebius was for much of the
time in the very thick of the fight, and was an eyewitness of numerous martyrdoms not only in
Palestine, but also in Tyre and in Egypt.

o

The date of his visits to the latter places (H. E. VIII. 7, 9) cannot be determined with
exactness. They are described in connection with what seem to be the earlier events of the
persecution, and yet it is by no means certain that chronological order has been observed in the
narratives.
The mutilation of prisoners-such as Potamo suffered-seems to have become
common only in the year 308 and thereafter (see Mason's Persecution of Diocletian, p. 281), and
hence if Eusebius was imprisoned with Potamo during his visit to Egypt, as seems most probable,
In con
there would be some reason for assigning that visit to the later years of the persecution.
firmation of this might be urged the improbability that he would leave Caesarea while Pamphilus
was still alive, either before or after the latter's imprisonment, and still further his own state
ment in H. E. VII. 32, that he had observed Meletius escaping the fury of the persecution for
seven years in Palestine.
It is therefore likely that Eusebius did not make his journey to Egypt,
which must have occupied some time, until toward the very end of the persecution, when it raged
there with exceeding fierceness during the brief outburst of the infamous Maximin.

-

§ 4. Eusebius' Accession to the Bishopric of Caesarea.

Not long after the close of the persecution, Eusebius became bishop of Caesarea in Pales
tine, his own home, and held the position until his death. The exact date of his accession cannot
be ascertained, indeed we cannot say that it did not take place even before the close of the perse
cution, but that is hardly probable ; in fact, we know of no historian who places it earlier than
313.
His immediate predecessor in the episcopate was Agapius, whom he mentions in terms of
praise in H. E. VII. 32. Some writers have interpolated a bishop Agricolaus between Agapius
and Eusebius (see e.g. Tillemont, Hist. Ecc/es. VII. 42), on the ground that his name appears in
one of the lists of those present at the Council of Ancyra (c. 314), as bishop of Caesarea in
But, as Hefele shows (Concisiengesch. I. 220),
Palestine (see Labbei et Cossartii Conc. I. 1475).
this list is of late date and not to be relied upon. On the other hand, as Lightfoot points out, in
the Libellus Synodicus (Conc. I. 1480), where Agricolaus is said to have been present at the
Council of Ancyra, he is called bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia; and this statement is confirmed
by a Syriac list given in Cowper's Miscellanies, p. 41. Though perhaps no great reliance is to be

placed upon the correctness of any of these lists, the last two may at any rate be set over
against the first, and we may conclude that there exists no ground for assuming that Agapius,

likely, in view of Eusebius' silence on the subject.
It would seem more likely that he outlived
the persecution.

sentence of the preceding chapter makes it evident that the speaker was a bishop : "Every one
of the rulers (épxávrov) present delivered panegyric discourses." The date of the dedication of
this church is a unatter of dispute, though it is commonly put in the year 315.
It is plain from
Eusebius' speech that it was uttered before Licinius had begun to persecute the Christians, and
also, as Görres remarks, at a time when Constantine and Licinius were at least outwardly at peace
with each other.
In the year 314 the two emperors went to war, and consequently, if the perse
cution of Licinius began soon after that event, as it is commonly supposed to have done, the
address must have been delivered before hostilities opened; that is, at least as early as 314,
and this is the year in which Görres places it (Kritische Untersuchungen ueber die /icinianische
Christenwerfolgung, p. 8).
But if Görres' date (319 A.D.) for the commencement of the perse
cution be accepted (and though he can hardly be said to have proved it, he has urged some
strong grounds in support of it), then the address may have been delivered at almost any time
between 315 and 319, for, as Görres himself shows, Licinius and Constantine were outwardly at
peace during the greater part of that time (ib. p. 14 sq.).
There is nothing in the speech itself
which prevents this later date, nor is it intrinsically improbable that the great basilica reached
completion only in 315 or later.
In fact, it must be admitted that Eusebius may have become
bishop at any time between about 311 and 318.

The persecution of Licinius, which continued until his defeat by Constantine, in 323, was but
local, and seems never to have been very severe.
Indeed, it did not bear the character of a
bloody persecution, though a few bishops appear to have met their death on one ground or
another. Palestine and Egypt seem not to have suffered to any great extent (see Görres, ib. p. 32 sq.).

§ 5. The Outbreak of the Arian Controversy.

The Attitude of Eusebius.

About the year 318, while Alexander was bishop of Alexandria, the Arian controversy broke
out in that city, and the whole Eastern Church was soon involved in the strife. We cannot enter
here into a discussion of Arius' views; but in order to understand the rapidity with which the
Arian party grew, and the strong hold which it possessed from the very start in Syria and Asia
Minor, we must remember that Arius was not himself the author of that system which we know as
Arianism, but that he learned the essentials of it from his instructor Lucian. The latter was one
of the most learned men of his age in the Oriental Church, and founded an exegetico-theological
school in Antioch, which for a number of years stood outside of the communion of the orthodox
Church in that city, but shortly before the martyrdom of Lucian himself (which took place in 31 1
or 312) made its peace with the Church, and was recognized by it. He was held in the highest
reverence by his disciples, and exerted a great influence over them even after his death. Among
them were such men as Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia, Asterius, and others who were afterward
known as staunch Arianists. According to Harnack the chief points in the system of Lucian and
his disciples were the creation of the Son, the denial of his co-eternity with the Father, and his

combine the elements given by Lucian in a more complete and well-ordered system, and then to
bring that system forward clearly and publicly, and endeavor to make it the faith of the Church
at large.
His christology was essentially opposed to the Alexandrian, and it was natural that he
should soon come into conflict with that church, of which he was a presbyter (upon Lucian's
teaching and its relation to Arianism, see Harnack's Dogmengeschichse, II. p. 183 sq.).

Socrates (H. E. I. 5 sq.), Sozomen (H. E. I. 15) and Theodoret (H. E. I. 2 sq.), all of whom
give accounts of the rise of Arianism, differ as to the immediate occasion of the controversy, but
agree that Arius was excommunicated by a council convened at Alexandria, and that both he and
the bishop Alexander sent letters to other churches, the latter defending his own course, the former
complaining of his harsh treatment, and endeavoring to secure adherents to his doctrine.
Eusebius of Nicomedia at once became his firm supporter, and was one of the leading figures on
the Arian side throughout the entire controversy.

the imperial residence, and later of Constantinople, was of great advantage to the Arian cause,
especially toward the close of Constantine's reign.
From a letter addressed by this Eusebius to
Paulinus of Tyre (Theodoret, H. E. I. 6) we learn that Eusebius of Caesarea was quite zealous in
behalf of the Arian cause. The exact date of the letter we do not know, but it must have been
Arius himself, in an epistle addressed to Eusebius of
written at an early stage of the controversy.
Nicomedia (Theodoret, H. E. I. 5), claims Eusebius of Caesarea among others as accepting at least
one of his fundamental doctrines ("And since Eusebius, your brother in Caesarea, and Theodotus,
and Paulinus, and Athanasius, and Gregory, and Aetius, and all the bishops of the East say that
More than this, Sozomen
God existed before the Son, they have been condemned," etc.).
(H. E. I. 15) informs us that Eusebius of Caesarea and two other bishops, having been appealed
to by Arius for "permission for himself and his adherents, as he had already attained the rank of
presbyter, to form the people who were with them into a church," concurred with others "who
were assembled in Palestine," in granting the petition of Arius, and permitting him to assemble
the people as before ; but they "enjoined submission to Alexander, and commanded Arius to
strive incessantly to be restored to peace and communion with him." The addition of the last
sentence is noticeable, as showing that they did not care to support a presbyter in open and per
sistent rebellion against his bishop. A fragment of a letter written by our Eusebius to Alexander
is still extant, and is preserved in the proceedings of the Second Council of Nicaea, Act. VI.
In this epistle Eusebius strongly remon

strates with Alexander for having misrepresented the views of Arius.
Still further, in his epistle
to Alexander of Constantinople, Alexander of Alexandria (Theodoret, H. E. I. 4) complains of
three Syrian bishops "who side with them [i.e. the Arians] and excite them to plunge deeper
and deeper into iniquity."
The reference here is commonly supposed to be to Eusebius of
Caesarea, and his two friends Paulinus of Tyre and Theodotus of Laodicea, who are known to
have shown favor to Arius.

may be seen by examining the testimonies quoted below on p. 67 sq.
In agreement with these
early Fathers, many modern historians have attacked Eusebius with great severity, and have
endeavored to show that the opinion that he was an Arian is supported by his own writings.
Among those who have judged him most harshly are Baronius (ad ann. 340, c. 38 sq.), Petavius

On the other hand, as may be seen from the testimonies in Eusebius' favor, quoted below on
p. 57 sq., many of the Fathers, who were themselves orthodox, looked upon Eusebius as likewise
sound on the subject of the Trinity. He has been defended in modern times against the charge
of Arianism by a great many prominent scholars; among others by Walesius in his Life of Euse

widespread belief that he was an Arian be explained by admitting that he was for a time the per
sonal friend of Arius, but denying that he accepted, or in any way sympathized with his views (cf.
Newman's Arians, p. 262).
There are in fact certain fragments of epistles extant, which are, to
say the least, decidedly Arianistic in their modes of expression, and these must be reckoned with
in forming an opinion of Eusebius' views; for there is no reason to deny, as Lee does, that they
are from Eusebius' own hand. On the other hand, to maintain, with some of the Fathers and
many of the moderns, that Eusebius was and continued through life a genuine Arian, will not do
in the face of the facts that contemporary and later Fathers were divided as to his orthodoxy,
that he was honored highly by the Church of subsequent centuries, except at certain periods, and
was even canonized (see Lightfoot's article, p. 348), that he solemnly signed the Nicene Creed,
which contained an express condemnation of the distinctive doctrines of Arius, and finally that at
least in his later works he is thoroughly orthodox in his expressions, and is explicit in his rejection
of the two main theses of the Arians, - that there was a time when the Son of God was not, and

such passages in Eusebius' works as bear upon the subject under dispute.
Lee has considered
many of them at great length, and the reader may be referred to him for further information.

A careful examination of them will, I believe, serve to convince the candid student that there
is a distinction to be drawn between those works written before the rise of Arius, those written
between that time and the Council of Nicaea, and those written after the latter.
It has been very
common to draw a distinction between those works written before and those written after the
Council, but no one, so far as I know, has distinguished those productions of Eusebius' pen which
appeared between 318 and 325, and which were caused by the controversy itself, from all his
other writings. And yet such a distinction seems to furnish the key to the problem.
Eusebius'
opponents have drawn their strongest arguments from the epistles which Eusebius wrote to
Alexander and to Euphration; his defenders have drawn their arguments chiefly from the
works which he produced subsequent to the year 325; while the exact bearing of the expressions
used in his works produced before the controversy broke out has always been a matter of sharp
dispute.
Lee has abundantly shown his Contra Marce/, his De Ecc/. Theo/, his 7% cophania
(which was written after the Council of Nicaea, and not, as Lee supposes, before it), and other
later works, to be thoroughly orthodox and to contain nothing which a trinitarian might not have

PROLEGOMENA.

although we find some expressions employed which it would not have been possible for an
orthodox trinitarian to use after the Council of Nicaea, at least without careful limitation to guard
against misapprehension, there is nothing even in these works which requires us to believe that
he accepted the doctrines of Arius' predecessor, Lucian of Antioch; that is, there is nothing dis
tinctly and positively Arianistic about them, although there are occasional expressions which might
lead the reader to expect that the writer would become an Arian if he ever learned of Arius'

doctrines.
lack of clearness in the conception of the nature of that divinity, it must be remembered that
there was at this time no especial reason for emphasizing and defining it, but there was on the
contrary very good reason for laying particular stress upon the subordination of the Son over
against Sabellianism, which was so widely prevalent during the third century, and which was exert
ing an influence even over many orthodox theologians who did not consciously accept Sabellian
istic tenets. That Eusebius was a decided subordinationist must be plain to every one that reads
his works with care, especially his earlier ones.
It would be surprising if he had not been, for he
was born at a time when Sabellianism (monarchianism) was felt to be the greatest danger to
which orthodox christology was exposed, and he was trained under the influence of the followers
of Origen, who had made it one of his chief aims to emphasize the subordination of the Son over
against that very monarchianism." The same subordinationism may be clearly seen in the writings
of Dionysius of Alexandria and of Gregory Thaumaturgus, two of Origen's greatest disciples.
It
must not be forgotten that at the beginning of the fourth century the problem of how to preserve
the Godhood of Christ and at the same time his subordination to the Father (in opposition to the
monarchianists) had not been solved.
Eusebius in his earlier writings shows that he holds both
(he cannot be convicted of denying Christ's divinity), but that he is as far from a solution of the
problèm, and is just as uncertain in regard to the exact relation of Father and Son, as Tertullian,
Hippolytus, Origen, Dionysius, and Gregory Thaumaturgus were ;
is just as inconsistent in his
modes of expression as they, and yet no more so (see Harnack's Dogmengeschichte, I. pp. 628 sq.
and 634 sq., for an exposition of the opinions of these other Fathers on the subject).
Eusebius,
with the same immature and undeveloped views which were held all through the third century,
wrote those earlier works which have given rise to so much dispute between those who accuse
him of Arianism and those who defend him against the charge. When he wrote them he was
neither Arian nor Athanasian, and for that reason passages may be found in them which if
written after the Council of Nicaea might prove him an Arian, and other passages which might as
truly prove him an Athanasian, just as in the writings of Origen were found by both parties
passages to support their views, and in Gregory Thaumaturgus passages apparently teaching
Arianism, and others teaching its opposite, Sabellianism (see Harnack, ib. p. 646).

Let us suppose now that Eusebius, holding fast to the divinity of Christ, and yet convinced
just as firmly of his subordination to the Father, becomes acquainted through Arius, or other like
minded disciples of Lucian of Antioch, with a doctrine which seems to preserve the Godhood,
while at the same time emphasizing strongly the subordination of the Son, and which formulates

* It is interesting to notice that the creed of the Caesarean
church which Eusebius presented at the Council of Nice contains a
clause which certainly looks as if it had been composed in opposition
to the familiar formula of the Sabellians: "The same one is the
Father, the same one the Son, the same one the Holy Spirit" (row
avrov elva warápa, Tov abrov etva,

made in the same section, that the Sabellians taught that God acts
in three forms: in the form of the Father, as creator and law
giver; in the form of the Son, as redeemer; and in the form of essential divinity of all three persons.

the Spirit, as life-giver, etc.). The clause of the Caesarean creed
referred to runs as follows: "That the Father is truly
Father,
the Son truly Son, and the Holy Spirit truly Holy Spirit" (marépa
&Ambos rarépa, Kai viov &Ambos viov, xai movedua aytov dam 00s aytov).
It is significant that in the revised creed adopted by the Council
these words are omitted, evidently because the occasion for them
no longer existed, since not Sabellianism but Arianism was the her
esy combated; and because, more than that, the use of them would
but weaken the emphasis which the Council wished to put upon the

right in claiming him as a supporter.
There is that in the epistles which is to be found nowhere
in his previous writings, and which distinctly separates him from the orthodox party. How then
are we to explain the fact that a few years later he signed the Nicene creed and anathematized
Before we can understand his conduct, it is necessary to examine care
the doctrines of Arius P.
fully the two epistles in question.
Such an examination will show us that what Eusebius is
defending in them is not genuine Arianism. He evidently thinks that it is, evidently supposes
that he and Arius are in complete agreement upon the subjects under discussion; but he is mis
taken. The extant fragments of the two epistles are given below on p. 70.
It will be seen that
Eusebius in them defends the Arian doctrine that there was a time when the Son of God was not.
It will be seen also that he finds fault with Alexander for representing the Arians as teaching that
the "Son of God was made out of nothing, like all creatures," and contends that Arius teaches
that the Son of God was begotten, and that he was not produced like all creatures. We know
that the Arians very commonly applied the word "begotten" to Christ, using it in such cases as
synonymous with "created," and thus not implying, as the Athanasians did when they used the
word, that he was of one substance with the Father (compare, for instance, the explanation of the
meaning of the term given by Eusebius of Nicomedia in his epistle to Paulinus; Theod. H. E.
I. 6).
It is evident that the use of this word had deceived our Eusebius, and that he was led by
it to think that they taught that the Son was of the Father in a peculiar sense, and did in reality
partake in some way of essential Godhood. And indeed it is not at all surprising that the words
of Arius, in his epistle to Alexander of Alexandria (see Athan. Ep. de conc. Arim. et Seleuc.,
chap. II. § 3 ; Oxford edition of Athanasius' Tracts against Arianism, p. 97), quoted by
Eusebius in his epistle to the same Alexander, should give Eusebius that impression. The words
are as follows: "The God of the law, and of the prophets, and of the New Testament before
eternal ages begat an only-begotten Son, through whom also He made the ages and the universe.
And He begat him not in appearance, but in truth, and subjected him to his own will, unchange.
able and immutable, a perfect creature of God, but not as one of the creatures."
Arius' use here
of the word "begat," and his qualification of the word "creature" by the adjective "perfect," and
by the statement that he was "not as one of the creatures" naturally tended to make Eusebius
think that Arius acknowledged a real divinity of the Son, and that appeared to him to be all that
was necessary.
Meanwhile Alexander in his epistle to Alexander of Constantinople (Theod.
H. E. I. 4) had, as Eusebius says, misstated Arius' opinion, or at least had attributed to him the
belief that Christ was "made like all other men that have ever been born," whereas Arius

result to which the other views of Arius must lead ; but Eusebius did not think so, and felt him
self called upon to remonstrate with Alexander for what seemed to him the latter's unfairness in
the matter.

When we examine the Caesarean creed' which Eusebius presented to the Council as a fair
statement of his belief, we find nothing in it inconsistent with the acceptance of the kind of
Arianism which he defends in his epistle to Alexander, and which he evidently supposed to be

the Son is himself God, but not true God."
But we have no right to interpret these words, torn
as they are from the context which might make their meaning perfectly plain, without due regard
to Eusebius' belief expressed elsewhere in this epistle, and in his epistle to Alexander which was

the real divinity of the Son, while in the other fragment of his epistle to Euphration he dwells
upon the subordination of the Son and approves the Arian opinion, which he had defended also
in the other epistle, that the "Father was before the Son." The expression, "not true God" (a
very common Arian expression; see Athan. Orat. c. Arian. I. 6) seems therefore to have been

PROLEGOMENA.

used by Eusebius to express a belief, not that the Son did not possess real divinity (as the genuine
Arians used it), but that he was not equal to the Father, who, to Eusebius' thought, was "true
God." He indeed expressly calls the Son 6eós, which shows - when the sense in which he else
where uses the word is considered - that he certainly did believe him to partake of Godhood,
though, in some mysterious way, in a smaller degree, or in a less complete manner than the Father.
That Eusebius misunderstood Arius, and did not perceive that he actually denied all real deity
to the Son, was due doubtless in part to his lack of theological insight (Eusebius was never a great
theologian), in part to his habitual dread of Sabellianism (of which Arius had accused Alexander,
and toward which Eusebius evidently thought that the latter was tending), which led him to look
with great favor upon the pronounced subordinationism of Arius, and thus to overlook the dan
gerous extreme to which Arius carried that subordinationism.

We are now, the writer hopes, prepared to admit that Eusebius, after the breaking out of the
Arian controversy, became an Arian, as he understood Arianism, and supported that party with
considerable vigor ; and that not as a result of mere personal friendship, but of theological con
viction.
At the same time, he was then, as always, a peace-loving man, and while lending Arius
his approval and support, he united with other Palestinian bishops in enjoining upon him submis
sion to his bishop (Sozomen, H. E. I. 15).
As an Arian, then, and yet possessed with the desire
of securing, if it were possible, peace and harmony between the two factions, Eusebius appeared at
the Council of Nicaea, and there signed a creed containing Athanasian doctrine and anathematizing
the chief tenets of Arius. How are we to explain his conduct? We shall, perhaps, do best to let

and declared to be good and unexceptionable, ran thus : -

born of every creature, before all the ages, begotten from the Father, by whom also all things were made; who

"On this faith being publicly put forth by us, no room for contradiction appeared ; but our
most pious Emperor, before any one else, testified that it comprised most orthodox statements.
He confessed, moreover, that such were his own sentiments; and he advised all present to agree
to it, and to subscribe its articles and to assent to them, with the insertion of the single word,
‘One in substance' (Öpool'ortos), which, moreover, he interpreted as not in the sense of the affec
tions of bodies, nor as if the Son subsisted from the Father, in the way of division, or any sever

ance ; for that the immaterial and intellectual and incorporeal nature could not be the subject of
any corporeal affection, but that it became us to conceive of such things in a divine and ineffable
manner. And such were the theological remarks of our most wise and most religious Emperor;
but they, with a view to the addition of ‘One in substance,' drew up the following formula :-

"‘We believe in One God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible: - And in One
Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father, Only-begotten, that is, from the Substance of the
Father; God from God, Light from Light, very God from very God, begotten, not made, One in substance with the
Father, by whom all things were made, both things in heaven and things in earth; who for us men and for our
salvation came down and was made flesh, was made man, suffered, and rose again the third day, ascended into
heaven, and cometh to judge quick and dead.

"‘And in the Holy Ghost.

But those who say, "Once He was not," and "Before His generation He was
not," and "He came to be from nothing," or those who pretend that the Son of God is "Of other subsistence or
substance," or "created," or "alterable," or "mutable," the Catholic Church anathematizes."

"On their dictating this formula, we did not let it pass without inquiry in what sense they
introduced ‘of the substance of the Father,' and ‘one in substance with the Father." Accord
ingly questions and explanations took place, and the meaning of the words underwent the scrutiny
of reason. And they professed that the phrase " of the substance was indicative of the Son's
being indeed from the Father, yet without being as if a part of Him. And with this understand
ing we thought good to assent to the sense of such religious doctrine, teaching, as it did, that the
Son was from the Father, not, however, a part of His substance. On this account we assented to
the sense ourselves, without declining even the term "One in substance,' peace being the object
which we set before us, and steadfastness in the orthodox view.
In the same way we also
admitted ‘begotten, not made '; since the Council alleged that "made was an appellative com
mon to the other creatures which came to be through the Son, to whom the Son had no likeness.
Wherefore, said they, He was not a work resembling the things which through Him came to be,
but was of a substance which is too high for the level of any work, and which the Divine oracles
teach to have been generated from the Father, the mode of generation being inscrutable and
incalculable to every generated nature. And so, too, on examination there are grounds for say.
ing that the Son is ‘one in substance' with the Father; not in the way of bodies, nor like mortal
beings, for He is not such by division of substance, or by severance; no, nor by any affection, or
alteration, or changing of the Father's substance and power (since from all such the ingenerate
nature of the Father is alien), but because ‘one in substance with the Father' suggests that the
Son of God bears no resemblance to the generated creatures, but that to His Father alone who
begat Him is He in every way assimilated, and that He is not of any other subsistence and sub
stance, but from the Father.

"To which term also, thus interpreted, it appeared well to assent ; since we were aware that,
even among the ancients, some learned and illustrious Bishops and writers have used the term
‘one in substance' in their theological teaching concerning the Father and Son.

self, and justified by the fore-mentioned considerations. And as to the anathematism published
by them at the end of the Faith, it did not pain us, because it forbade to use words not in Scrip
ture, from which almost all the confusion and disorder of the Church have come.
Since, then,
no divinely inspired Scripture has used the phrases, "out of nothing' and once He was not,' and
the rest which follow, there appeared no ground for using or teaching them ; to which also we
assented as a good decision, since it had not been our custom hitherto to use these terms.
Moreover, to anathematize ‘Before His generation He was not
did not seem preposterous, in
that it is confessed by all that the Son of God was before the generation according to the flesh.

in energy, He was in virtue with the Father ingenerately, the Father being always Father, as King
always and Saviour always, having all things in virtue, and being always in the same respects and
in the same way.
This we have been forced to transmit to you, Beloved, as making clear to you
the deliberation of our inquiry and assent, and how reasonably we resisted even to the last minute,
as long as we were offended at statements which differed from our own, but received without
contention what no longer pained us, as soon as, on a candid examination of the sense of the
words, they appeared to us to coincide with what we ourselves have professed in the faith which
we have already published.""

-

It will be seen that while the expressions "of the substance of the Father," "begotten, not
made," and "One in substance," or "consubstantial with the Father," are all explicitly anti-Arian
istic, yet none of them contradicts the doctrines held by Eusebius before the Council, so far as we
can learn them from his epistles to Alexander and Euphration and from the Caesarean creed.
His
own explanation of those expressions, which it is to be observed was the explanation given by the
Council itself, and which therefore he was fully warranted in accepting, - even though it may not
have been so rigid as to satisfy an Athanasius, - shows us how this is. He had believed before
that the Son partook of the Godhood in very truth, that He was "begotten," and therefore "not
made," if "made" implied something different from "begotten," as the Nicene Fathers held
that it did ; and he had believed before that the "Son of God has no resemblance to created
things, but is in every respect like the Father only who begat him, and that He is of no other
substance or essence than the Father," and therefore if that was what the word "Consubstantial"
(§uootorios) meant he could not do otherwise than accept that too.

It is clear that the dread of Sabellianism was still before the eyes of Eusebius, and was the
cause of his hesitation in assenting to the various changes, especially to the use of the word
āpool'ortos, which had been a Sabellian word and had been rejected on that account by the Synod
of Antioch, at which Paul of Samosata had been condemned some sixty years before.

It still remains to explain Eusebius' sanction of the anathemas attached to the creed which
expressly condemn at least one of the beliefs which he had himself formerly held, viz.: that the
"Father was before the Son," or as he puts it elsewhere, that "He who is begat him who was
not." The knot might of course be simply cut by supposing an act of hypocrisy on his part, but
the writer is convinced that such a conclusion does violence to all that we know of Eusebius and
of his subsequent treatment of the questions involved in this discussion.
It is quite possible to
suppose that a real change of opinion on his part took place during the sessions of the Council.
Indeed when we realize how imperfect and incorrect a conception of Arianism he had before
the Council began, and how clearly its true bearing was there brought out by its enemies, we
can see that he could not do otherwise than change; that he must have become either an out
and-out Arian, or an opponent of Arianism as he did. When he learned, and learned for the first
time, that Arianism meant the denial of all essential divinity to Christ, and when he saw that it
involved the ascription of mutability and of other finite attributes to him, he must either change
entirely his views on those points or he must leave the Arian party. To him who with all his
subordinationism had laid in all his writings so much stress on the divinity of the Word (even
though he had not realized exactly what that divinity involved) it would have been a revolution

not surprising that he should become convinced that the Arian formula-"there was a time when

It is not surprising, moreover, that they should have succeeded in explaining to him at least

Eusebius apparently based his knowledge of the system, use those expressions, although he too
teaches the same doctrine. The fact is that in that epistle Arius studiously avoids such favorite
Arian phrases as might emphasize the differences between himself and Alexander, and Eusebius
seems to have avoided them for the same reason. We conclude then that Eusebius was not an
Arian (nor an adherent of Lucian) before 318, that soon after that date he became an Arian

of the strongest of Athanasius' colleagues.
In his contest with him it was again anti-Sabellianistic
polemics which absorbed him and increased his distaste for Spooortov and minimized his emphasis
upon the distinctively anti-Arianistic doctrines formulated at Nicaea.
For any except the very
wisest minds it was a matter of enormous difficulty to steer between the two extremes in those
times of strife; and while combating Sabellianism not to fall into Arianism, and while combating
the latter not to be engulfed in the former. That Eusebius under the constant pressure of the

years, can hardly be cited as an evidence either of wrong heart or of weak head. An Athanasius

§ 6.

The Council of Mica'a.

At the Council of Nicaea, which met pursuant to an imperial summons in the year 325 A.D.,
Eusebius played a very prominent part. A description of the opening scenes of the Council is
given in his Visa Constantini, III. Io sq.
After the Emperor had entered in pomp and had taken
his seat, a bishop who sat next to him upon his right arose and delivered in his honor the open

this bishop was our Eusebius. Sozomen (H. E. I. 19) states it directly; and Eusebius, although
he does not name the speaker, yet refers to him, as he had referred to the orator at the dedication
of Paulinus' church at Tyre, in such a way as to make it clear that it was himself; and moreover
in his Vita Constantini, I. 1, he mentions the fact that he had in the midst of an assembly of the
servants of God addressed an oration to the Emperor on the occasion of the latter's vicemnasia,
i.e. in 325 A.D. On the other hand, however, Theodoret (H. E. I. 7) states that this opening
oration was delivered by Eustathius, bishop of Antioch ; while Theodore of Mopsuestia and Phi
lostorgius (according to Nicetas Choniates, Zhes. de orthod. fia. V. 7) assign it to Alexander of
Alexandria. As Lightfoot suggests, it is possible to explain the discrepancy in the reports by

C 2

2O

PRO LEGOMENA.

supposing that Eustathius and Alexander, the two great patriarchs, first addressed a few words
to the Emperor and that then Eusebius delivered the regular oration.
This supposition is not at
all unlikely, for it would be quite proper for the two highest ecclesiastics present to welcome the
Emperor formally in behalf of the assembled prelates, before the regular oration was delivered
by Eusebius.
At the same time, the supposition that one or the other of the two great patriarchs
must have delivered the opening address was such a natural one that it may have been adopted
by Theodoret and the other writers referred to without any historical basis.
It is in any case
certain that the regular oration was delivered by Eusebius himself (see the convincing arguments
adduced by Stroth, p. xxvii. sq.).
This oration is no longer extant, but an idea of its character
may be formed from the address delivered by Eusebius at the Emperor's tricennalia (which is
still extant under the title De /audibus Constantini; see below, p. 43) and from the general tone
It was avowedly a panegyric, and undoubtedly as fulsome as it was
of his Life of Constantine.
possible to make it, and his powers in that direction were by no means slight.

That Eusebius, instead of the bishop of some more prominent church, should have been
selected to deliver the opening address, may have been in part owing to his recognized standing
as the most learned man and the most famous writer in the Church, in part to the fact that he
was not as pronounced a partisan as some of his distinguished brethren ; for instance, Alexander
of Alexandria, and Eusebius of Nicomedia; and finally in some measure to his intimate relations
with the Emperor. How and when his intimacy with the latter grew up we do not know. As
already remarked, he seems to have become personally acquainted with him many years before,
when Constantine passed through Caesarea in the train of Diocletian, and it may be that a mutual
friendship, which was so marked in later years, began at that time.
However that may be,
Eusebius seems to have possessed special advantages of one kind or another, enabling him to
come into personal contact with official circles, and once introduced to imperial notice, his wide
learning, sound common sense, genial temper and broad charity would insure him the friendship
of the Emperor himself, or of any other worthy officer of state. We have no record of an
intimacy between Constantine and Eusebius before the Council of Nicaea, but many clear intima
tions of it after that time.
In fact, it is evident that during the last decade at least of the
Emperor's life, few, if any, bishops stood higher in his esteem or enjoyed a larger measure of his
confidence. Compare for instance the records of their conversations (contained in the Visa
Constantini, I. 28 and II. 9), of their correspondence (ib. II. 46, III. 61, IV. 35 and 36), and
the words of Constantine himself (ib. III. 60). The marked attention paid by him to the
speeches delivered by Eusebius in his presence (ib. IV. 33 and 46) is also to be noticed.
Eusebius' intimacy with the imperial family is shown likewise in the tone of the letter which he
wrote to Constantia, the sister of Constantine and wife of Licinius, in regard to a likeness of
Christ which she had asked him to send her. The frankness and freedom with which he remon
strates with her for what he considers mistaken zeal on her part, reveal a degree of familiarity
which could have come only from long and cordial relations between himself and his royal
correspondent.
Whatever other reasons therefore may have combined to indicate Eusebius as
the most fitting person to deliver the oration in honor of the Emperor at the Council of Nicaea,
there can be little doubt that Constantine's personal friendship for him had much to do with
his selection. The action of the Council on the subject of Arianism, and Eusebius' conduct in
the matter, have already been discussed. Of the bishops assembled at the Council, not far from
three hundred in number (the reports of eye-witnesses vary from two hundred and fifty to three
hundred and eighteen), all but two signed the Nicene creed as adopted by the Council.
These
two, both of them Egyptians, were banished with Arius to Illyria, while Eusebius of Nicomedia,
and Theognis of Nicaea, who subscribed the creed itself but refused to assent to its anathemas,
were also banished for a time, but soon yielded, and were restored to their churches.

sary to enter here. We have no record of the part which Eusebius took in these transactions.
Lightfoot has abundantly shown (p. 31.3 sq.) that the common supposition that Eusebius was the
author of the paschal cycle of nineteen years is false, and that there is no reason to suppose that
he had anything particular to do with the decision of the paschal question at this Council.

§ 7. Continuance of the Arian Controversy. A usebius' A'elations to the 7 wo Parties.

The Council of Nicaea did not bring the Arian controversy to an end. The orthodox party
was victorious, it is true, but the Arians were still determined, and could not give up their enmity
against the opponents of Arius, and their hope that they might in the end turn the tables on their
Meanwhile, within a few years after the Council, a quarrel broke out between our
antagonists.
Eusebius and Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, a resolute supporter of Nicene orthodoxy.
Accord
ing to Socrates (H. E. I. 23) and Sozomen (AH. E. II. 18) Eustathius accused Eusebius of
perverting the Nicene doctrines, while Eusebius denied the charge, and in turn taxed Eustathius
with Sabellianism. The quarrel finally became so serious that it was deemed necessary to sum
mon a Council for the investigation of Eustathius' orthodoxy and the settlement of the dispute.
This Council met in Antioch in 330 A.D. (see Tillemont, VII. p. 65.1 sq., for a discussion of the
date), and was made up chiefly of bishops of Arian or semi-Arian tendencies.
This fact, however,
brings no discredit upon Eusebius. The Council was held in another province, and he can have
had nothing to do with its composition.
In fact, convened, as it was, in Eustathius' own city, it
must have been legally organized ; and indeed Eustathius himself acknowledged its jurisdiction
by appearing before it to answer the charges made against him.
Theodoret's absurd account of
the origin of the synod and of the accusations brought against Eustathius (H. E. I. 21) bears
upon its face the stamp of falsehood, and is, as Hefele has shown (Conciliengeschichte, I. 451),
hopelessly in error in its chronology.
It is therefore to be rejected as quite worthless. The
decision of the Council doubtless fairly represented the views of the majority of the bishops of
that section, for we know that Arianism had a very strong hold there. To think of a packed Council
and of illegal methods of procedure in procuring the verdict against Eustathius is both unnecessary
and unwarrantable. The result of the Council was the deposition of Eustathius from his bishopric
and his banishment by the Emperor to Illyria, where he afterward died. There is a division of
opinion among our sources in regard to the immediate successor of Eustathius.
All of them
agree that Eusebius was asked to become bishop of Antioch, but that he refused the honor, and
that Euphronius was chosen in his stead.
Socrates and Sozomen, however, inform us that the
election of Eusebius took place immediately after the deposition of Eustathius, while Theodoret
(H. E. I. 22) names Eulalius as Eustathius' immediate successor, and states that he lived but a
Theodoret is supported by
short time, and that Eusebius was then asked to succeed him.
Jerome (Chron., year of Abr. 2345) and by Philostorgius (H. E. III. 15), both of whom insert
a bishop Eulalius between Eustathius and Euphronius.
It is easier to suppose that Socrates and
Sozomen may have omitted so unimportant a name at this point than that the other three witnesses
Socrates indeed implies in the same chapter that his knowledge of
inserted it without warrant.
these affairs is limited, and it is not surprising that Eusebius' election, which caused a great stir,
should have been connected in the mind of later writers immediately with Eustathius' deposi
tion, and the intermediate steps forgotten.
It seems probable, therefore, that immediately
after the condemnation of Eustathius, Eulalius was appointed in his place, perhaps by the same
Council, and that after his death, a few months later, Eusebius, who had meanwhile gone back to
Caesarea, was elected in due order by another Council of neighboring bishops summoned for
the purpose, and that he was supported by a large party of citizens.
It is noticeable that the
letter written by the Emperor to the Council, which wished to transfer Eusebius to Antioch (see
Vita Const. III. 62), mentions in its salutation the names of five bishops, but among them is
only one (Theodotus who is elsewhere named as present at the Council which deposed Eusta

seems to point to a different council.

It is greatly to Eusebius' credit that he refused the call extended to him. Had he been
governed simply by selfish ambition he would certainly have accepted it, for the patriarchate
of Antioch stood at that time next to Alexandria in point of honor in the Eastern Church.
The Emperor commended him very highly for his decision, in his epistles to the people of
Antioch and to the Council (Vita Const. III. 60, 62), and in that to Eusebius himself (ib. III. 61).
He saw in it a desire on Eusebius' part to observe the ancient canon of the Church, which
forbade the transfer of a bishop from one see to another.
But that in itself can hardly have been
sufficient to deter the latter from accepting the high honor offered him, for it was broken without
scruple on all sides.
It is more probable that he saw that the schism of the Antiochenes would
be embittered by the induction into the bishopric of that church of Eustathius' chief opponent,
and that he did not feel that he had a right so to divide the Church of God.
Eusebius' general
character, as known to us, justifies us in supposing that this high motive had much to do with
his decision. We may suppose also that so difficult a place can have had no very great attractions
for a man of his age and of his peace-loving disposition and scholarly tastes.

of quarrels and seditions of all kinds, and would have been obliged to devote his entire attention
to the performance of his official duties.
His own tastes therefore must have conspired with his
sense of duty to lead him to reject the proffered call and to remain in the somewhat humbler
station which he already occupied.

Not long after the deposition of Eustathius, the Arians and their sympathizers began to work
more energetically to accomplish the ruin of Athanasius, their greatest foe. He had become
Alexander's successor as bishop of Alexandria in the year 326, and was the acknowledged head of
the orthodox party.
If he could be brought into discredit, there might be hopes of restoring
Arius to his position in Alexandria, and of securing for Arianism a recognition, and finally a
dominating influence in the church at large. To the overthrow of Athanasius therefore all good
Arians bent their energies. They found ready accomplices in the schismatical Meletians of

must be framed of another sort, and of a sort to stir up the anger of the Emperor against him.
The Arians therefore and the Meletians began to spread the most vile and at the same time
absurd stories about Athanasius (see especially the latter's Apol. c. Arian. $ 59 sq.).
These at
last became so notorious that the Emperor summoned Athanasius to appear and make his defense
before a council of bishops to be held in Caesarea (Sozomen, H. E. II, 25; Theodoret, H. E.
I. 28).
Athanasius, however, fearing that the Council would be composed wholly of his enemies,
and that it would therefore be impossible to secure fair play, excused himself and remained away.
But in the following year (see Sozomen, H. E. II, 25) he received from the Emperor a summons
to appear before a council at Tyre. The summons was too peremptory to admit of a refusal,
and Athanasius therefore attended, accompanied by many of his devoted adherents (see Sozomen,
ið... Theodoret, H. E. I. 30 ; Socrates, H. E. I. 28 ; Athanasius, Apol. c. Arian. $ 71 sq.;
Eusebius, Visa Const. IV. 41 sq., and Epiphanius, Haer. LXVIII. 8).
After a time, perceiving
that he had no chance of receiving fair play, he suddenly withdrew from the Council and proceeded
directly to Constantinople, in order to lay his case before the Emperor himself, and to induce the
latter to allow him to meet his accusers in his presence, and plead his cause before him.

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF EUSEBIUS.

Caesarea the previous year was made an important item of the prosecution.
It was during this
Council that Potamo flung at Eusebius the taunt of cowardice, to which reference was made above,
and which doubtless did much to confirm Eusebius' distrust of and hostility to the Athanasian party.
Whether Eusebius of Caesarea, as is commonly supposed, or Eusebius of Nicomedia, or some
other bishop, presided at this Council we are not able to determine. The account of Epiphanius
seems to imply that the former was presiding at the time that Potamo made his untimely accusa

tion.
of Nicomedia is named by some of them, but which they are I have not been able to discover.
We learn from Socrates (H. E. I. 28), as well as from other sources, that this Synod of Tyre was
held in the thirtieth year of Constantine's reign, that is, between July, 334, and July, 335.
As
the Council was closed only in time for the bishops to reach Jerusalem by July, 335, it is probable
that it was convened in 335 rather than in 334.
From Sozomen (H. E. II. 25) we learn also
that the Synod of Caesarea had been held the preceding year, therefore in 333 or 334 (the latter
being the date commonly given by historians).
While the Council of Tyre was still in session,
the bishops were commanded by Constantine to proceed immediately to Jerusalem to take part in
the approaching festival to be held there on the occasion of his tricenna/ia. The scene was one
of great splendor.
Bishops were present from all parts of the world, and the occasion was
marked by the dedication of the new and magnificent basilica which Constantine had erected upon
the site of Calvary (Theodoret, I. 31 ; Socrates, I. 28 and 33; Sozomen, II. 26; Eusebius, Vita
Const. IV. 41 and 43). The bishops gathered in Jerusalem at this time held another synod
before separating.
In this they completed the work begun at Tyre, by re-admitting Arius and
his adherents to the communion of the Church (see Socrates, I. 33 and Sozomen, II. 27). Accord
ing to Sozomen the Emperor, having been induced to recall Arius from banishment in order to
reconsider his case, was presented by the latter with a confession of faith, which was so worded
as to convince Constantine of his orthodoxy.
He therefore sent Arius and his companion
Euzoius to the bishops assembled in Jerusalem with the request that they would examine the
confession, and if they were satisfied with its orthodoxy would re-admit them to communion.
The Council, which was composed largely of Arius' friends and sympathizers, was only too glad
to accede to the Emperor's request.

Meanwhile Athanasius had induced Constantine, out of a sense of justice, to summon the
bishops that had condemned him at Tyre to give an account of their proceedings before the

Emperor himself at Constantinople.
summons came while the bishops were at Jerusalem, and the majority of them at once returned
home in alarm, while only a few answered the call and repaired to Constantinople. Among these
were Eusebius of Nicomedia, Theognis of Nicaea, Patrophilus of Scythopolis, and other prominent
Arians, and with them our Eusebius (Athanasius, Apos. c. Arian. §§ 86 and 87; Socrates, I. 3335; Sozomen, II. 28). The accusers of Athanasius said nothing on this occasion in regard to
his alleged immoralities, for which he had been condemned at Tyre, but made another equally
trivial accusation against him, and the result was his banishment to Gaul.
Whether Constantine
banished him because he believed the charge brought against him, or because he wished to pre
serve him from the machinations of his enemies (as asserted by his son Constantine, and appar
ently believed by Athanasius himself; see his Apol. c. Arian. $ 87), or because he thought that
Athanasius' absence would allay the troubles in the Alexandrian church we do not know. The
latter supposition seems most probable.
In any case he was not recalled from banishment until
after Constantine's death. Our Eusebius has been severely condemned by many historians for
the part taken by him in the Eustathian controversy and especially in the war against Athanasius.
In justice to him a word or two must be spoken in his defense.

Eustathius are concerned, it is to be noticed that the latter commenced the controversy by

self, and in doing so he could not do otherwise than accuse Eustathius of Sabellianism ; for if
the latter was not satisfied with Eusebius' orthodoxy, which Eusebius himself believed to be

by unworthy motives, or by a desire for revenge, is evinced by his rejection of the proffered call to
Antioch, the acceptance of which would have given him so good an opportunity to triumph over
his fallen enemy.
It must be admitted, in fact, that Eusebius comes out of this controversy with
out a stain of any kind upon his character. He honestly believed Eustathius to be a Sabellian,
and he acted accordingly.

Eusebius has been blamed still more severely for his treatment of Athanasius.

But again the
facts must be looked at impartially.
It is necessary always to remember that Sabellianism was in
the beginning and remained throughout his life the heresy which he most dreaded, and which
he had perhaps most reason to dread.
He must, even at the Council of Nicaea, have suspected
Athanasius, who laid so much stress upon the unity of essence on the part of Father and Son, of
a leaning toward Sabellianistic principles; and this suspicion must have been increased when he
discovered, as he believed, that Athanasius' most staunch supporter, Eustathius, was a genuine

all the other leading Arians, had signed the Nicene creed and had proclaimed themselves thor
oughly in sympathy with its teaching.
Our Eusebius, knowing the change that had taken place
in his own mind upon the controverted points, may well have believed that their views had under
gone even a greater change, and that they were perfectly honest in their protestations of ortho
doxy. And finally, when Arius himself presented a confession of faith which led the Emperor,
who had had a personal interview with him, to believe that he had altered his views and was in
complete harmony with the Nicene faith, it is not surprising that our Eusebius, who was naturally
unsuspicious, conciliatory and peace-loving, should think the same thing, and be glad to receive
Arius back into communion, while at the same time remaining perfectly loyal to the orthodoxy

being in large measure allayed, and his distrust of the orthodoxy of Athanasius and of his adhe
rents being increased by the course of events, it was only natural that he should lend more or less
credence to the calumnies which were so industriously circulated against Athanasius. To charge
him with dishonesty for being influenced by these reports, which seem to us so absurd and pal
pably calumnious, is quite unwarranted.
Constantine, who was, if not a theologian, at least a
clear-headed and sharp-sighted man, believed them, and why should Eusebius not have done the
same? The incident which took place at the Council of Tyre in connection with Potamo and
himself was important; for whatever doubts he may have had up to that time as to the truth of
the accusations made against Athanasius and his adherents, Potamo's conduct convinced him that
the charges of tyranny and high-handed dealing brought against the whole party were quite true.

the minor combatants, although his position and his learning would have entitled him to take the
most prominent position in the whole affair, if he had cared to. He was but true to his general
character in shrinking from such a controversy, and in taking part in it only in so far as his con
science compelled him to. We may suspect indeed that he would not have made one of the
small party that repaired to Constantinople in response to the Emperor's imperious summons had
it not been for the celebration of Constantine's tricemnasia, which was taking place there at the
time, and at which he delivered, on the special invitation of the Emperor and in his presence, one
of his greatest orations.
Certain it is, from the account which he gives in his Vita Constantini,
that both in Constantinople and in Jerusalem the festival of the tricemnasia, with its attendant cere
monies, interested him much more than did the condemnation of Athanasius.

§ 8.

Eusebit/s and Marce/lus.

It was during this visit to Constantinople that another synod was held, at which Eusebius was
present, and the result of which was the condemnation and deposition of the bishop Marcellus
of Ancyra (see Socrates, I. 36; Sozomen, II. 33 ; Eusebius, Contra Marc. II. 4). The attitude
of our Eusebius toward Marcellus is again significant of his theological tendencies.
Marcellus
had written a book against Asterius, a prominent Arian, in which, in his zeal for the Nicene ortho
doxy, he had laid himself open to the charge of Sabellianism. On this account he was deposed
by the Constantinopolitan Synod, and our Eusebius was urged to write a work exposing his errors
and defending the action of the Council. As a consequence he composed his two works against
Marcellus which will be described later.
That Eusebius, if not in the case of Athanasius and
possibly not in that of Eustathius, had at least in the present case good ground for the belief that
Marcellus was a Sabellian, or Sabellianistic in tendency, is abundantly proved by the citations which
he makes from Marcellus' own works; and, moreover, his judgment and that of the Synod was
later confirmed even by Athanasius himself. Though not suspecting Marcellus for some time,
Athanasius finally became convinced that he had deviated from the path of orthodoxy, and, as
Newman has shown (in his introduction to Athanasius' fourth discourse against the Arians, Oxford
Zibrary of the Fathers, vol. 19, p. 503 sq.), directed that discourse against his errors and those
of his followers.

The controversy with Marcellus seems to have been the last in which Eusebius was engaged,
and it was opposition to the dreaded heresy of Sabellius which moved him here as in all the
other cases.
It is important to emphasize, however, what is often overlooked, that though Euse.
bius during these years was so continuously engaged in controversy with one or another of the
members of the anti-Arian party, there is no evidence that he ever deviated from the doctrinal
position which he took at the Council of Nicaea.
After that date it was never Arianism which

he consciously supported ; it was never the Nicene orthodoxy which he opposed.
ported those members of the old Arian party who had signed the Nicene creed and protested
that they accepted its teaching, against those members of the opposite party whom he believed
to be drifting toward Sabellianism, or acting tyrannously and unjustly toward their opponents.
The anti-Sabellianistic interest influenced him all the time, but his post-Nicene writings contain
no evidence that he had fallen back into the Arianizing position which he had held before 325.
They reveal, on the contrary, a fair type of orthodoxy, colored only by its decidedly anti
Sabellian emphasis.

The Death of Eusebius.

In less than two years after the celebration of his tricemnasia, on May 22, 337 A.D., the great
Constantine breathed his last, in Nicomedia, his former Capital.

produced a lasting testimonial of his own unbounded affection and admiration for the first Chris

advanced age of nearly, if not quite, eighty years. The exact date of his death is unknown, but
it can be fixed approximately. We know from Sozomen (H. E. III. 5) that in the summer of
341, when a council was held at Antioch (on the date of the Council, which we are able to fix
with great exactness, see Hefele, Concillengesch. I. p. 502 sq.) Acacius, Eusebius' successor, was
already bishop of Caesarea.
Socrates (H. E. II.4) and Sozomen (H. E. III. 2) both mention
the death of Eusebius and place it shortly before the death of Constantine the younger, which
took place early in 340 (see Tillemont's Hist, des Em/. IV. p. 327 sq.), and after the intrigues
had begun which resulted in Athanasius' second banishment. We are thus led to place Eusebius'
death late in the year 339, or early in the year 34o (cf. Lightfoot's article, p. 318).

CHAPTER II.

THE WRITINGS OF EUSEBIUS.

§ 1.

Eusebius as a Writer.

EUSEBIUS was one of the most voluminous writers of antiquity, and his labors covered almost

every field of theological learning.

modern scholars have been prone to do, his invaluable productions in other departments.
Light
foot passes a very just judgment upon the importance of his works in the following words: "If
the permanent utility of an author's labors may be taken as a test of literary excellence, Eusebius
will hold a very high place indeed. The Ecclesiastical History is absolutely unique and indis
pensable. The Chronicle is the vast storehouse of information relating to the ancient monarchies
of the world. The Preparation and Demonstration are the most important contributions to
theology in their own province.
Even the minor works, such as the Martyrs of Palestine, the
Zife of Constantine, the Questions addressed to Stephanus and to Marinus, and others, would
leave an irreparable blank, if they were obliterated. And the same permanent value attaches also
to his more technical treatises. The Canons and Sections have never yet been superseded for
their particular purpose. The Zopography of Palestine is the most important contribution to our

under heavier obligations."

If we look in Eusebius' works for evidences of brilliant genius we shall be disappointed. He

upon his vast erudition and his sterling sense.
His powers of acquisition were remarkable and
his diligence in study unwearied. He had at his command undoubtedly more acquired material
than any man of his age, and he possessed that true literary and historical instinct which enabled
him to select from his vast stores of knowledge those things which it was most worth his while to
tell to the world.
His writings therefore remain valuable while the works of many others, perhaps
no less richly equipped than himself for the mission of adding to the sum of human knowledge,
are entirely forgotten. He thus had the ability to do more than acquire; he had the ability
to impart to others the very best of that which he acquired, and to make it useful to them. There

which marks his works almost without exception, and raises them above the commonplace.
His
exegesis is superior to that of most of his contemporaries, and his apologetics is marked by

permanent value.
His wide acquaintance, too, with other systems than his own, and with the
products of Pagan as well as Christian thought, enabled him to see things in their proper relations
and to furnish a treatment of the great themes of Christianity adapted to the wants of those who
had looked beyond the confines of a single school.
At the same time it must be acknowledged
that he was not always equal to the grand opportunities which his acquaintance with the works
and lives of other men and other peoples opened before him. He does not always reveal the
possession of that high quality of genius which is able to interpret the most various forces and to
discover the higher principles of unity which alone make them intelligible; indeed, he often loses
himself completely in a wilderness of thoughts and notions which have come to him from other
men and other ages, and the result is dire confusion.

We shall be disappointed, too, if we seek in the works of Eusebius for evidences of a refined
literary taste, or for any of the charms which attach to the writings of a great master of compo
sition.
His style is, as a rule, involved and obscure, often painfully rambling and incoherent.
This quality is due in large part to the desultoriness of his thinking. He did not often enough
clearly define and draw the boundaries of his subject before beginning to write upon it. He
apparently did much of his thinking after he had taken pen in hand, and did not subject what
he had thus produced to a sufficiently careful revision, if to any revision at all.
Thoughts and
suggestions poured in upon him while he was writing; and he was not always able to resist the
temptation to insert them as they came, often to the utter perversion of his train of thought, and
to the ruin of the coherency and perspicuity of his style.
It must be acknowledged, too, that his
literary taste was, on the whole, decidedly vicious. Whenever a flight of eloquence is attempted
by him, as it is altogether too often, his style becomes hopelessly turgid and pretentious.
At such
times his skill in mixing metaphors is something astounding (compare, for instance, H. E. II. 14).
This is especially true
On the other hand, his works contain not a few passages of real beauty.
of his Martyrs of Palestine, where his enthusiastic admiration for and deep sympathy with the
heroes of the faith cause him often to forget himself and to describe their sufferings in language
of genuine fire or pathos.
At times, too, when he has a sharply defined and absorbing aim in
mind, and when the subject with which he is dealing does not seem to him to demand rhetorical
adornment, he is simple and direct enough in his language, showing in such cases that his
commonly defective style is not so much the consequence of an inadequate command of the
Greek tongue as of desultory thinking and vicious literary taste.

But while we find much to criticise in Eusebius' writings, we ought not to fail to give him
due credit for the conscientiousness and faithfulness with which he did his work. He wrote often,
it is true, too rapidly for the good of his style, and he did not always revise his works as care
fully as he should have done; but we seldom detect undue haste in the collection of materials or
carelessness and negligence in the use of them. He seems to have felt constantly the responsi
bilities which rested upon him as a scholar and writer, and to have done his best to meet those
responsibilities.
It is impossible to avoid contrasting him in this respect with the most learned
man of the ancient Latin Church, St. Jerome. The haste and carelessness with which the latter
composed his De Viris Illustribus, and with which he translated and continued Eusebius' Chronic/e,
remain an everlasting disgrace to him. An examination of those and of some others of Jerome's
works must tend to raise Eusebius greatly in our esteem. He was at least conscientious and
honest in his work, and never allowed himself to palm off ignorance as knowledge, or to deceive
his readers by sophistries, misstatements, and pure inventions. He aimed to put the reader into
possession of the knowledge which he had himself acquired, but was always conscientious enough
to stop there, and not attempt to make fancy play the rôle of fact.

One other point, which was mentioned some pages back, and to which Lightfoot calls particular
attention, should be referred to here, because of its bearing upon the character of Eusebius'
writings. He was, above all things, an apologist; and the apologetic aim governed both the
selection of his subjects and method of his treatment. He composed none of his works with a

PRO LEGOMENA.

purely scientific aim. He thought always of the practical result to be attained, and his selection of
material and his choice of method were governed by that. And yet we must recognize the fact that
this aim was never narrowing in its effects. He took a broad view of apologetics, and in his lofty
conception of the Christian religion he believed that every field of knowledge might be laid under
tribute to it. He was bold enough to be confident that history, philosophy, and science all con
tribute to our understanding and appreciation of divine truth; and so history and philosophy and
science were studied and handled by him freely and fearlessly. He did not feel the need of
distorting truth of any kind because it might work injury to the religion which he professed. On
the contrary, he had a sublime faith which led him to believe that all truth must have its place
and its mission, and that the cause of Christianity will be benefited by its discovery and diffusion.
As an apologist, therefore, all fields of knowledge had an interest for him ; and he was saved that
pettiness of mind and narrowness of outlook which are sometimes characteristic of those who
write with a purely practical motive.

Eusebius himself
refers to this work in four passages (H. E. VI. 32, VII. 32, VIII. 13, and Mars. Pal. c. 11).
In the last he informs us that it consisted of three books. The work is mentioned also more than
once by Jerome (De vir. is/. 81 ; Ep. ad Marces/am, Migne's ed. Ep. 34; Contra Aof. I. 9), who
speaks of it in terms of praise, and in the last passage gives a brief extract from the third book,
which is, so far as known, the only extant fragment of the work. The date of its composition can
be fixed within comparatively narrow limits.
It must of course have been written before the shorter
recension of the Martyrs of Palestine, which contains a reference to it (on its relation to the

as early as 313 A.D. (?), see below, p. 45). On the other hand, it was written after Pamphilus'
death (see H. E. VII. 32, 25), which occurred in 31o.

Martyrs of Palestine (trepi rôv čv IIa)\atorrivil paprupmorávrov).

This work is extant in two
recensions, a longer and a shorter. The longer has been preserved entire only in a Syriac version,
which was published, with English translation and notes, by Cureton in 1861. A fragment of the
original Greek of this work as preserved by Simeon Metaphrastes had previously been published
by Papebroch in the Acta Sanctorum (June, tom. I. p. 64; reprinted by Fabricius, Hippolytus,
II. p. 217), but had been erroneously regarded as an extract from Eusebius' Life of Pamphilus.
Cureton's publication of the Syriac version of the Martyrs of Palestine showed that it was a part
of the original of that work. There are extant also, in Latin, the Acts of St. Procopius, which were
published by Walesius (in his edition of Eusebius' Hist. Eccles. in a note on the first chapter of
the Mars. Pas.; reprinted by Cureton, Mart. Pal. p. 50 sq.).
Moreover, according to Cureton,
Assemani's Acta S.S. Martyrum Orient. et Occidentalium, part II. p. 169 sq. (Romae, 1748)
contains another Syriac version of considerable portions of this same work. The Syriac version
published by Cureton was made within less than a century after the composition of the original
work (the manuscript of it dates from 411 A.D.; see Cureton, ió., preface, p. i.), perhaps within
a few years after it, and there is every reason to suppose that it represents that original with

considerable exactness.
In addition to this longer recension there is extant in Greek a shorter form of the same work
which is found attached to the Ecclesiastica/ History in most MSS. of the latter.
In some of
them it is placed between the eighth and ninth books, in others at the close of the tenth book,
while one MS. inserts it in the middle of VIII. 13.
In some of the most important MSS. it is

eighth book.
In the present volume the
translation of it is given as an appendix to the eighth book, on p. 342 sq.

Migne gives it separately in Opera, II. 1457 sq.

There can be no doubt that the shorter form is younger than the longer. The mention of the
Life of Pamphilus which is contained in the shorter, but is not found in the corresponding passage
of the longer form would seem to indicate that the former was a remodeling of the latter rather
than the latter of the former (see below, p. 30).
Moreover, as Cureton and Lightfoot both
point out, the difference between the two works both in substange and in method is such as to
make it clear that the shorter form is a revised abridgment of the longer.
That Eusebius himself
was the author of the shorter as well as of the longer form is shown by the fact that not only in
the passages common to both recensions, but also in those peculiar to the shorter one, the author
speaks in the same person and as an eye-witness of many of the events which he records. And
still further, in Chap. 11 he speaks of having himself written the Life of Pamphilus in three books,

formed "part of a larger work, in which the sufferings of the martyrs were set off against the
deaths of the persecutors," and he is inclined to see in the brief appendix to the eighth book of
the History (translated below on p. 340) "a fragment of the second part of the treatise of which
the Martyrs of Palestine in the shorter recension formed the first." The suggestion is, to say the
least, very plausible.
If it be true, the attachment of the shorter form of the Martyrs of Pases/ime
to the Aecclesiastica/ //issory was probably the work, not of Eusebius himself, but of some copyist
or copyists, and the disagreement among the various MSS. as to its position in the //issory is more
easily explained on this supposition than on Cureton's theory that it was attached to a later edition
of the latter work by Eusebius himself.

3O

PROLEGOMENA.

The date at which the Martyrs of Pa/estine was composed cannot be determined with cer
tainty.
It was at any rate not published until after the first nine books of the Ecclesiastical History
(i.e. not before 313, see below, p. 45), for it is referred to as a projected work in H. E. VIII.
13. 7. On the other hand, the accounts contained in the longer recension bear many marks of
having been composed on the spot, while the impressions left by the martyrdoms witnessed by the
author were still fresh upon him.
Moreover, it is noticeable that in connection with the account
of Pamphilus' martyrdom, given in the shorter recension, reference is made to the Life of
Pumphilus as a book already published, while in the corresponding account in the longer recen
This would seem to indicate that the Life of Pamphisus was

written after the longer, but before the shorter recension of the Martyrs.
But on the other hand
the Life was written before the Ecclesiastical //istory (see above, p. 29), and consequently before
the publication of either recension of the Martyrs. May it not be that the accounts of the various
martyrdoms were written, at least some of them, during the persecution, but that they were not
arranged, completed, and published until 313, or later?
If this be admitted we may suppose
that the account of Pamphilus' martyrdom was written soon after his death and before the Life
was begun. When it was later embodied with the other accounts in the one work On the Martyrs
of Palestine it may have been left just as it was, and it may not have occurred to the author to
insert a reference to the Life of Pamphilus which had meanwhile been published.
But when he
came to abridge and in part rewrite for a new edition the accounts of the various martyrdoms
contained in the work On Martyrs he would quite naturally refer the reader to the Zise for fuller
particulars.

-

If we then suppose that the greater part of the longer recension of the Martyrs was already
complete before the end of the persecution, it is natural to conclude that the whole work was
published at an early date, probably as soon as possible after the first edition of the History.
How much later the abridgment was made we cannot tell."

The differences between the two recensions lie chiefly in the greater fullness of detail on the
part of the longer one. The arrangement and general mode of treatment is the same in both.
They contain accounts of the Martyrs that suffered in Palestine during the years 303-31 o, most
of whom Eusebius himself saw.

dom of Pamphilus and others at Smyrna, of the persecution in Lyons and Vienne, and of the
defense of Apollonius in Rome, which Eusebius inserts in his Ecc/esiastica/Asistory (IV. 15, V. 1,
V. 21), are taken, as he informs us, from this collection.
As to the time of compilation, we can
say only that it antedates the composition of the earlier books of the History (on whose date,
see below, p. 45).

Chronicle (xpovukoi kavóves).

Eusebius refers to this work in his Church History (I. 1), in
his Praeparatio Evang. X. 9, and at the beginning of his Ecsoga prophetica.
It is divided into
two books, the first of which consists of an epitome of universal history drawn from various
sources, the second of chronological tables, which "exhibit in parallel columns the succession
of the rulers of different nations in such a way that the reader can see at a glance with whom any
given monarch was contemporary." The tables "are accompanied by notes, marking the years
of some of the more remarkable historical events, these notes also constituting an epitome of
Eusebius was not the first Christian writer to compose a work on universal chronology.
history."
Julius Africanus had published a similar work early in the third century, and from that Eusebius
drew his model and a large part of the material for his own work.
At the same time his Chronicle
is more than a simple revision of Africanus' work, and contains the result of much independent
investigation on his own part. The work of Africanus is no longer extant, and that of Eusebius
was likewise lost for a great many centuries, being superseded by a revised Latin edition, issued
by Jerome.
Jerome's edition, which comprises only the second book of Eusebius' Chronicle, is
a translation of the original work, enlarged by notices taken from various writers concerning
This,

together with numerous Greek fragments preserved by various ancient writers, constituted our
only source for a knowledge of the original work, until late in the last century an Armenian trans
lation of the whole work was discovered and published in two volumes by J. B. Aucher: Venice,
1818. The Armenian translation contains a great many errors and not a few lacunae, but it is
our most valuable source for a knowledge of the original work.

The aim of the Chronic/e was, above all, apologetic, the author wishing to prove by means
of it that the Jewish religion, of which the Christian was the legitimate continuation, was older
than the oldest of heathen cults, and thus deprive pagan opponents of their taunt of novelty, so

had emphasized the antiquity of Judaism ; but Julius Africanus was the first to devote to the
matter scientific study, and it was with the same idea that Eusebius followed in his footsteps.
The Chronology, in spite of its errors, is invaluable for the light it throws on many otherwise dark
periods of history, and for the numerous extracts it contains from works no longer extant.

There are good and sufficient reasons (as is pointed out by Salmon in his article in Smith and
Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography) for supposing that two editions of the Chronicle were
published by Eusebius.
But two of these reasons need be stated here : first, the chronology of
the Armenian version differs from that of Jerome's edition in many important particulars, diver
gencies which can be satisfactorily accounted for only on the supposition of a difference in the
sources from which they respectively drew; secondly, Jerome states directly that the work was
brought down to the vicemnasia of Constantine, - that is, to the year 325, - but the Chronicle is
referred to as an already published work in the Ec/oga prophetica (I. 1), and in the Prasaratio
Evang. (X. 9), both of which were written before 313. We may conclude, then, that a first
edition of the work was published during, or more probably before, the great persecution, and
that a second and revised edition was issued probably in 325, or soon thereafter.

For further particulars in regard to the Chronic/e see especially the article of Salmon already
referred to. The work has been issued separately a great many times. We may refer here to
the edition of Scaliger, which was published in 1606 (2d ed. 1658), in which he attempted

APOLOGETIC WORKS.

Against Hieroc/es (mpos roës orép 'Amrox\ovsov too rvavéos ‘Iepokxéous Aóyous, as Photius calls

persecution, and afterwards governor of Egypt.
In both places he treated the Christians with
great severity, carrying out the edicts of the emperors to the fullest extent, and even making use
of the most terrible and loathsome forms of persecution (see Lactantius, De Mort. Pers. 16, and
Eusebius, Mart. Pal. 5, Cureton's ed. p. 18). He was at the same time a Neo-Platonic philoso
pher, exceedingly well versed in the Scriptures and doctrines of the Christians.
In a work
against the Christians entitled Aéyos boaX;6ms "pos rows Xptortuvoss, he brought forward many
scriptural difficulties and alleged contradictions, and also instituted a comparison between Christ
and Apollonius of Tyana, with the intention of disparaging the former.
Eusebius feels called upon
to answer the work, but confines himself entirely to that part of it which concerned Christ and
Apollonius, leaving to some future time a refutation of the remainder of the work, which indeed,
he says, as a mere reproduction of the arguments of Celsus, had been already virtually answered
by Origen (see chap. 1).
Eusebius admits that Apollonius was a good man, but refuses to con
cede that he was anything more, or that he can be compared with Christ. He endeavors to show
that the account of Apollonius given by Philostratus is full of contradictions and does not rest
upon trustworthy evidence. The tone of the book is mild, and the arguments in the main sound
and well presented.
It is impossible to fix the date of the work with any degree of certainty.
Valesius assigns it to the later years of the persecution, when Eusebius visited Egypt; Stein says
that it may have been written about 312 or 313, or even earlier; while Lightfoot simply remarks,
There is no ground for putting it at
"It was probably one of the earliest works of Eusebius."
one time rather than another except the intrinsic probability that it was written soon after the
work to which it was intended to be a reply.
In fact, had a number of years elapsed after the
publication of Hierocles' attack, Eusebius would doubtless, if writing against it at all, have given
a fuller and more complete refutation of it, such as he suggests in the first chapter that he may
yet give. The work of Hierocles, meanwhile, must have been written at any rate some time
before the end of the persecution, for it is mentioned in Lactantius' Div. Ins/. V. 2.

Eusebius' work has been published by Gaisford : /ouse/ii Prm/h. contra //ieroc/em et Mar
cellum sibri, Oxon. 1852; and also in various editions of the works of Philostratus. Migne, Opera
IV. 795 sq., reprints it from Olearius' edition of Philostratus' works (Lips. 1709).

Against Porphyry (kata IIop puptov).

Porphyry, the celebrated Neo-Platonic philosopher,
regarded by the early Fathers as the bitterest and most dangerous enemy of the Church, wrote
toward the end of the third century a work against Christianity in fifteen books, which was
looked upon as the most powerful attack that had ever been made, and which called forth refu
tations from some of the greatest Fathers of the age : from Methodius of Tyre, Eusebius of
Caesarea, and Apollinaris of Laodicea ; and even as late as the end of the fourth or beginning
of the fifth century the historian Philostorgius thought it necessary to write another reply to it

dictions in the Gospel records, and suggested difficulties which are still favorite weapons in
the hands of skeptics.
Like the work of Porphyry, and all the other refutations of it, the
It is mentioned by Jerome (de vir, ill. 81 and
Apology of Eusebius has entirely perished.
Ep. ad Magnum, $ 3, Migne's ed. Ep. 70), by Socrates (H. E. III. 23), and by Phi
lostorgius (H. E. VIII. 14).
There is some dispute as to the number of books it contained.
In his Ep. ad Magn. Jerome says that "Eusebius et Apollinaris viginti quinque, et triginta
volumina condiderunt," which implies that it was composed of twenty-five books; while in his
de vir. ill. 81, he speaks of thirty books, of which he had seen only twenty.
Vallarsi says,
however, that all his MSS. agree in reading "twenty-five" instead of "thirty" in the latter
passage, so that it would seem that the vulgar text is incorrect.

It is impossible to form an accurate notion of the nature and quality of Eusebius' refutation.
Socrates speaks of it in terms of moderate praise ("which [i.e. the work of Porphyry] has been
ably answered by Eusebius"), and Jerome does the same in his Ep. ad Magnum ("Alteri
[i.e. Porphyry] Methodius, Eusebius, et Apollinaris fortissime responderunt").
At the same
time the fact that Apollinaris and others still thought it necessary to write against Porphyry
would seem to show that Eusebius' refutation was not entirely satisfactory.
In truth, Jerome
(Ep. ad Pammachium et Oceanum, § 2, Migne's ed. Ep. 84) appears to rank the work of Apol
linaris above that of Eusebius, and Philostorgius expressly states that the former far surpassed the
latter (ěri troAi Kparely jyovuoruévov "Evore/3(9 kar' auros). The date of Eusebius' work cannot be
determined. The fact that he never refers to it, although he mentions the work of Porphyry a
number of times, has been urged by Valesius and others as proof that he did not write it until
after 325 A.D.; but it is quite possible to explain his silence, as Lardner does, by supposing that his
work was written in his earlier years, and that afterward he felt its inferiority and did not care to

questions connected with it.

On the Mumerous Progeny of the Ancients (trepi

rijs róv traXawów divöpóv troMutatóias). This
work is mentioned by Eusebius in his Praep. Evang. VII. 8. 20 (Migne, Opera, III. 525), but
by no one else, unless it be the book to which Basil refers in his De Soir. Sancto, 29, as
Difficulties respecting the Polygamy of the Ancients. The work is no longer extant, but we can
gather from the connection in which it is mentioned in the Praparatio, that it aimed at account
ing for the polygamy of the Patriarchs and reconciling it with the ascetic ideal of the Christian life
which prevailed in the Church of Eusebius' lifetime.
It would therefore seem to have been
written with an apologetic purpose.

Praeparatio Evangelica (irporapaorkevil elayyeMukij) and Demonstratio Evangelica ("EvayyeXux)
dróðaðis).
These two treatises together constitute Eusebius' greatest apologetic work. The
former is directed against heathen, and aims to show that the Christians are justified in accepting
the sacred books of the Hebrews and in rejecting the religion and philosophy of the Greeks.
The latter endeavors to prove from the sacred books of the Hebrews themselves that the Chris
tians do right in going beyond the Jews, in accepting Jesus as their Messiah, and in adopting
another mode of life. The former is therefore in a way a preparation for the latter, and the two
together constitute a defense of Christianity against all the world, Jews as well as heathen.
In
grandeur of conception, in comprehensiveness of treatment, and in breadth of learning, this
apology undoubtedly surpasses all other apologetic works of antiquity.
Lightfoot justly says,
"This great apologetic work exhibits the same merits and defects which we find elsewhere in
Eusebius.
There is the same greatness of conception marred by the same inadequacy of execu
...tion, the same profusion of learning combined with the same inability to control his materials,
which we have seen in his History. The divisions are not kept distinct; the topics start up

writings of the second century; it falls far short of the thoughtfulness and penetration which
give a permanent value to Origen's treatise against Celsus as a defense of the faith; it lags
behind the Latin apologists in rhetorical vigor and expression.
But the forcible and true
conceptions which it exhibits from time to time, more especially bearing on the theme which
may be briefly designated "God in history,' arrest our attention now, and must have impressed
his contemporaries still more strongly ; while in learning and comprehensiveness it is without a
rival." The wide acquaintance with classical literature exhibited by Eusebius in the Praparatio
is very remarkable.
Many writers are referred to whose names are known to us from no other
source, and many extracts are given which constitute our only fragments of works otherwise
totally lost. The Praparatio thus does for classical much what the History does for Christian
literature.

-

A very satisfactory summary of the contents of the Praeparatio is given at the beginning of
the fifteenth book.
In the first, second, and third books, the author exposes the absurdities of
heathen mythology, and attacks the allegorical theology of the Neo-Platonists; in the fourth and
fifth books he discusses the heathen oracles; in the sixth he refutes the doctrine of fate; in
the seventh he passes over to the Hebrews, devoting the next seven books to an exposition of
the excellence of their system, and to a demonstration of the proposition that Moses and the
prophets lived before the greatest Greek writers, and that the latter drew their knowledge from
the former ; in the fourteenth and fifteenth books he exposes the contradictions among Greek
philosophers and the vital errors in their systems, especially in that of the Peripatetics. The
Praeparatio is complete in fifteen books, all of which are still extant.

The Demonstratio consisted originally of twenty books (see Jerome's de zir. is/. 81, and
Photius' Bib/. Io). Of these only ten are extant, and even in the time of Nicephorus Callistus
no more were known, for he gives the number of the books as ten (H. E. VI. 37). There
exists also a fragment of the fifteenth book, which was discovered and printed by Mai (Script.
ves. nova coll. I. 2, p. 173).
In the first book, which is introductory, Eusebius shows why the
Christians pursue a mode of life different from that of the Jews, drawing a distinction between
Hebraism, the religion of all pious men from the beginning, and Judaism, the special system of
the Jews, and pointing out that Christianity is a continuation of the former, but a rejection of

of the Gentiles and the repudiation of the Jews are foretold in Scripture.
In books three to nine
he discusses the humanity, divinity, incarnation, and earthly life of the Saviour, showing that all
were revealed in the prophets.
In the remainder of the work we may assume that the same
general plan was followed, and that Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, and the spread of
his Church, were the subjects discussed in this as in nearly all works of the kind.

There is much dispute as to the date of these two works.

two passages in the History Eusebius has been commonly supposed to refer to the Demonstratio
(H. E. I. 2 and 6), but it is probable that the first, and quite likely the second also, refers to
the Eclogae Proph. We can, therefore, base no argument upon those passages.
But in Prap.
Zwang. XII. Io (Opera, III. 969) there is a reference to the persecution, which seems clearly
to imply that it was still continuing ; and in the Demons/ratio (III. 5 and IV. 6; Opera, IV.
213 and 307), which was written after the Prasarasio, are still more distinct indications of the
continuance of the persecution. On the other hand, in V. 3 and VI. 20 (Opera, IV. 364 and

The Praeparatio and Demonstratio are found in Migne's edition of the Opera, III. and IV.
9 sq. A more recent text is that of Dindorf in Teubner's series, 1867. The Praeparatio has been
published separately by Heinichen, 2 vols., Lips. 1842, and by Gaisford, 4 vols., Oxon. 1843.
The latter contains a full critical apparatus with Latin translation and notes, and is the most
useful edition which we have.

Seguier in 1846 published a French translation with notes.

The Demonstratio was also published by Gaisford in 2 vols., Oxon. 1852, with critical appa

from Photius' reference to it in Bib/. I I, of the latter from his mention of it in Bih/, 12.

Araparatio Aecc/esiastica

Lightfoot says that the latter is referred to also in the Jous Graeco-Romanum (lib. IV. p. 295;
ed. Leunclav.). We know nothing about the works (except that the first according to Photius
contained extracts), and should be tempted to think them identical with the Praparatio and
Demonstratio Evang, were it not that Photius expressly mentions the two latter in another part

suggests that those portions of the Theo/hania (Book IV.) which relate to the foundation of the
Church may have been adopted from the Dem. Ecc/esiastica, as other portions of the work (Book
V.) are adopted from the Dem. Evang.

-

If there is a reference in the Pop. Evang. I. 3 (Opera, III. 33) to the Demonstratio Eccles.,
as Lightfoot thinks there may be, and as is quite possible, the latter work, and consequently in
all probability the Praes. Eccles. also, must have been written before 313 A.D.

Two Books of Objection and Defense ('EAéyxov kai 'AroMoysas Aéyot Soo).

These are no
longer extant, but are mentioned by Photius in his Bibl. 13. We gather from Photius' language
that two editions of the work were extant in his time. The books, as Photius clearly indicates,
contained an apology for Christianity against the attacks of the heathen, and not, as Cave supposed,
a defense of the author against the charge of Arianism.
The tract mentioned by Gelasius of
Cyzicus (see below, p. 64) is therefore not to be identified with this work, as Cave imagined
that it might be.

Theophania or Divine Manifestation (beosbáveta). A Syriac version of this work is extant in
the same MS. which contains the Martyrs of Pr/essine, and was first published by Lee in 1842.
In 1843 the same editor issued an English translation with notes and extended prolegomena
(Cambridge, 1 vol.). The original work is no longer extant in its entirety, but numerous Greek
fragments were collected and published by Mai in 1831 and 1833 (Script. oes
I.
and VIII.), and again with additions in 1847 (Bib/. Mora Pr/rt/m, IV. I Io and 3 Io; reprinted
by Migne, Opera, VI. 607-690.
Migne does not give the Syriac version). The manuscript
which contains the Syriac version was written in 411, and Lee thinks that the translation itself
may have been made even during the lifetime of Eusebius.
At any rate it is very old and, so
far as it is possible to judge, seems to have reproduced the sense of the original with comparative
accuracy. The subject of the work is the manifestation of God in the incarnation of the Word.
It aims to give, with an apologetic purpose, a brief exposition of the divine authority and influ
ence of Christianity.
It is divided into five books which handle successively the subject and
the recipients of the revelation, that is, the Logos on the one hand, and man on the other; the
necessity of the revelation; the proof of it drawn frym its effects; the proof of it drawn from
its fulfillment of prophecy; finally, the common objections brought by the heathen against Christ's

particularly of its Divine authority, and amazing influence, it has perhaps never been surpassed."
"When we consider the very extensive range of inquiry occupied by our author, the great variety
both of argument and information which it contains, and the small space which it occupies; we
cannot, I think, avoid coming to the conclusion, that it is a very extraordinary work, and one
which is as suitable to our own times as it was to those for which it was written.
Its chief
excellency is, that it is argumentative, and that its arguments are well grounded, and logically
conducted."

The Theophania contains much that is found also in other works of Eusebius.

Large portions
of the first, second, and third books are contained in the Oratio de Laudibus Constantini, nearly
the whole of the fifth book is given in the Dem. Evang., while many passages occur in the Praes.
Evang.

These coincidences assist us in determining the date of the work.

That it was written after
persecution had ceased and peace was restored to the Church, is clear from II. 76, III. 20, 79,
V. 52.
Lee decided that it was composed very soon after the close of the Diocletian persecution,
but Lightfoot has shown conclusively (p. 333) from the nature of the parallels between it and other
writings of Eusebius, that it must have been written toward the end of his life, certainly later than
the De Laud. Const. (335 A.D.), and indeed it is not improbable that it remained unfinished at
the time of his death.

-

III. POLEMIC WORKS.

Defense of Origen ('Ato\oysa intop 'Qptyévows).

This was the joint work of Eusebius and
Pamphilus, as is distinctly stated by Eusebius himself in his H. E. VI. 33, by Socrates, H. E. III. 7, by
the anonymous collector of the Synodica/. Epistles (Ep. 198), and by Photius, Bibl. 1 18. The last
writer informs us that the work consisted of six books, the first five of which were written by Euse
bius and Pamphilus while the latter was in prison, the last book being added by the former after
Pamphilus' death (see above, p. 9). There is no reason to doubt the statement of Photius, and we
may therefore assign the first five books to the years 307-309, and assume that the sixth was written
soon afterward. The Defense has perished, with the exception of the first book, which was
translated by Rufinus (Aousin. ad Hieron. I. 582), and is still extant in his Latin version.
Rufinus
ascribed this book expressly to Pamphilus, and Pamphilus' name alone appears in the translation.
Jerome (Contra Ruf. I. 8; II. 15, 23; III. 12) maintains that the whole work was written by
Eusebius, not by Pamphilus, and accuses Rufinus of having deliberately substituted the name of
the martyr Pamphilus for that of the Arianizing Eusebius in his translation of the work, in order
Jerome's unfairness and
to secure more favorable acceptance for the teachings of Origen.
dishonesty in this matter have been pointed out by Lightfoot (p. 340).
In spite of his endeavor
to saddle the whole work upon Eusebius, it is certain that Pamphilus was a joint author of it, and
it is quite probable that Rufinus was true to his original in ascribing to Pamphilus all the explan
ations which introduce and connect the extracts from Origen, which latter constitute the greater

The work was intended as a defense of Origen against the attacks of his opponents (see

Eusebius' H. E. VI. 33, and the Preface to the Defense itself).
Of these
VI. 13), Methodius, Eustathius, Apollinaris, and Theophilus all wrote against Origen.
only Methodius had written before the composition of the Defense, and he was expressly at
tacked in the sixth book of that work, according to Jerome (Contra Ruf. I. 11).
The wide
opposition aroused against Origen was chiefly in consequence not of his personal character, but
of his theological views. The Apology, therefore, seems to have been devoted in the main to
a defense of those views over against the attacks of the men that held and taught opposite
opinions, and may thus be regarded as in some sense a regular polemic. The extant book is
devoted principally to a discussion of Origen's views on the Trinity and the Incarnation.

was condemned.
It aims simply to expose his errors, exegetical as well as theological. The

Epiphanius (//ar. LXVI. 21) mentions, among other refutations
of the Manicheans, one by our Eusebius. The work is referred to nowhere else, and it is possible
that Epiphanius was mistaken in his reference, or that the refutation he has in mind formed only
a part of some other work, but we are hardly justified in asserting, as Lightfoot does, that the
work cannot have existed.

IV.

DOGMATIC WORKS.

General Elementary Introduction (‘H ka06Aou o'rotxeità8ms eiorayoys).

This work consisted
of ten books, as we learn from a reference to it in the Eclogae Propheticae, IV. 35.
It was
apparently a general introduction to the study of theology, and covered a great variety of
subjects.
Five brief fragments have been preserved, all of them apparently from the first book,
which must have dealt largely with general principles of ethics. The fragments were published
by Mai (Bibl. Mova Patrum, IV. 316), and are reprinted by Migne (Opera, IV. 1271 sq.).
In
addition to these fragments, the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth books of the work are extant
under the title:

Arophetical Extracts (IIpooporukai Ek\oyat).

Although this formed a part of the larger
work, it is complete in itself, and circulated independently of the rest of the Introduction.
It contains extracts of prophetical passages from the Old Testament relating to the person and
work of Christ, accompanied by explanatory notes.
It is divided into four books, the first
containing extracts from the historical Scriptures, the second from the Psalms, the third from
the other poetical books and from the prophets, the fourth from Isaiah alone. The personality
of the Logos is the main topic of the work, which is thus essentially dogmatic, rather than
apologetic, as it might at first glance seem to be.
It was composed during the persecution,
which is clearly referred to in Book I. chap. 8 as still raging; it must have been written there
fore between 303 and 313. The date of these books, of course, fixes the date of the Genera/
Introduction, of which they formed a part. The Eclogae are referred to in the History, I. 2. On
the other hand, they mention the Chronicle as a work already written (I. 1 : Opera, p. 1023);
a reference which goes to prove that there were two editions of the Chronicle (see above, p. 31).
The four books of the Prophetica/ Extracts were first published by Gaisford in 1842 (Oxford)
from a Vienna MS. The MS. is mutilated in many places, and the beginning, including the title
of the work, is wanting.

Migne has reprinted Gaisford's edition in the Opera, IV. 1017 sq.

On the Pascha/ Festival (repi ris roo rāorxa tépriss).

This work, as Eusebius informs us in
his Vita Const. IV. 34, was addressed to the Emperor Constantine, who commends it very highly

over, that the work had been translated into Latin.
It is no longer extant in its entirety, but
a considerable fragment of it was discovered by Mai in Nicetas' Casena on Luke, and pub
lished by him in his Bih/, Aoza Patrum, IV. p. 208 sq. The extant portion of it contains twelve
chapters, devoted partly to a discussion of the nature of the Passover and its typical significance,
partly to an account of the settlement of the paschal question at the Council of Nicaea, and partly
to an argument against the necessity of celebrating the paschal feast at the time of the Jewish Pass
over, based on the ground that Christ himself did not keep the Passover on the same day as the Jews.
Jerome, although he does not mention this work in his catalogue of Eusebius' writings (de vir.
is/. 81), elsewhere (ib. 61) states that Eusebius composed a paschäl canon with a cycle of nine

under discussion. The date of the work cannot be determined with exactness.
It was written
after the Council of Nicaea, and, as would seem from the connection in which it is mentioned in
the Vita Constantini, before the Emperor's tricennasia (335 A.D.), but not very long before.
The extant fragment, as published by Mai, is reprinted by Migne in the Opera, VI. 693-706.

V. CRITICAL AND EXEGETICAL WORKS.

Biblical Texts. We learn from Jerome (Praes, in librum Paralip.) that Eusebius and
Pamphilus published a number of copies of Origen's edition of the LXX., that is, of the fifth
column of the Hexapla. A colophon found in a Vatican MS., and given in fac-simile in Migne's
Opera, IV. 875, contains the following account of their labors (the translation is Lightfoot's): "It
was transcribed from the editions of the Hexapla, and was corrected from the Tetrapla of Origen
himself, which also had been corrected and furnished with scholia in his own handwriting ;
whence I, Eusebius, added the scholia, Pamphilus and Eusebius corrected [this copy]."
Compare also Field's //exas/a, I. p. xcix.

Taylor, in the Dictionary of Christian Biography, III, p. 21, says: "The whole work [i.e.
the Hexapla] was too massive for multiplication; but many copies of its fifth column alone
were issued from Caesarea under the direction of Pamphilus the martyr and Eusebius, and
this recension of the LXX. came into common use. Some of the copies issued contained also
marginal scholia, which gave inter asia a selection of readings from the remaining versions in the
Hexapla. The oldest extant MS. of this recension is the Leiden Codex Sarravianus of the fourth
or fifth century." These editions of the LXX. must have been issued before the year 309, when
Pamphilus suffered martyrdom, and in all probability before 307, when he was imprisoned (see
Lardner's Credibility, Part II. chap. 72.

In later years we find Eusebius again engaged in the publication of copies of the Scriptures.
According to the Visa Conso. IV. 36, 37, the Emperor wrote to Eusebius, asking him to prepare
fifty sumptuous copies of the Scriptures for use in his new Constantinopolitan churches. The
commission was carefully executed, and the MSS. prepared at great cost.
It has been thought
that among our extant MSS. may be some of these copies which were produced under Eusebius'
supervision, but this is extremely improbable (see Lightfoot, p. 334).

Zen Evange/ica/ Canons, with the Zeffer to Caspiani's presived (kavoves 6éka ; Camomes decem
harmoniae evangeliorum praemissa ad Carpianum epissosa). Ammonius of Alexandria early in
the third century had constructed a harmony of the Gospels, in which, taking Matthew as the
standard, he placed alongside of that Gospel the parallel passages from the three others.
Eusebius' work was suggested by this Harmony, as he tells us in his epistle to Carpianus.
An inconvenient feature of Ammonius' work was that only the Gospel of Matthew could
be read continuously, the sequence of the other Gospels being broken in order to bring
their parallel sections into the order followed by Matthew.
Eusebius, desiring to remedy this
defect, constructed his work on a different principle. He made a table of ten canons, each
containing a list of passages as follows: Canon I. passages common to all four Gospels; II, those
common to Matthew, Mark, and Luke ; III. those common to Matt., Luke, and John ; IV. those

common to Matt., Mark, and John ; V. those common to Matthew and Luke: VI. those com
mon to Matt. and Mark; VII. those common to Matt. and John ; VIII. those common to Luke
and Mark; IX, those common to Luke and John ; X, those peculiar to each Gospel: first to
Matthew, second to Mark, third to Luke, and fourth to John.

-

Each Gospel was then divided into sections, which were numbered continuously. The length
of the section was determined, not by the sense, but by the table of canons, each section com
prising a passage common to four, to three, to two Gospels, or peculiar to itself, as the case might
be. A single section therefore might comprise even less than a verse, or it might cover more
than a chapter. The sections were numbered in black, and below each number was placed a
second figure in red, indicating the canon to which the section belonged. Upon glancing at that
canon the reader would find at once the numbers of the parallel sections in the other Gospels,
and could turn to them readily. The following is a specimen of a few lines of the first canon : -

MT.

tot

MP.

A.
{

U.

t

t

IQ.

s
us?
w8

Thus, opposite a certain passage in John, the reader finds us? (12) written, and beneath it, A
(1). He therefore turns to the first canon (A) and finds that sections wa (11) in Matthew, 8 (4) in
Mark, and t (Io) in Luke are parallel with up in John. The advantage and convenience of such
a system are obvious, and the invention of it shows great ingenuity.
It has indeed never been
superseded, and the sections and canons are still indicated in the margins of many of our best
Greek Testaments (e.g., in those of Tregelles and of Tischendorf). The date of the construction
of these canons it is quite impossible to determine.
For further particulars in regard to them,
see Lightfoot's article on Eusebius, p. 334 sq., and Scrivener's Introduction to the Criticism of the
Mew 7estament, 2d ed. p. 54 sq. The canons, with the letter to Carpianus prefixed, are given
by Migne, Opera, IV. 1275-1292.

Gospel Questions and So/usions.

This work consists of two parts, or of two separate works
combined. The first bears the title Gospe/ Questions and So/w/ions addressed to Stephanus
(rpos Xrépavov trept rôv év ei'ayyeMots {nrmudrov kai Aitoreov), and is referred to by Eusebius in
his Dem. Evang. VII. 3, as Questions and So/utions on the Genealogy of our Saviour (rów els
rov yeweaxoysav roi ororipos jusov (mrmudirov kai Attoreov). The second part is entitled Gospe/
Questions and So/utions addressed to Marin/s (Tpos Maplvov). The first work consisted of two
books, as we learn from the opening of the second work.
In that passage, referring to the
previous work, Eusebius says that having discussed there the difficulties which beset the
beginning of the Gospels, he will now proceed to consider questions concerning the latter part
of them, the intermediate portions being omitted. He thus seems to regard the two works as
in a sense forming parts of one whole.
In his de vir. is/. 81, Jerome mentions among the
writings of Eusebius one On the /)iscrepancy of the Gospe/s (De Evange/iorum Diaphonia), and
in his Comm. in Mass. chap. I. vers. 16, he refers to Eusebius' /i/ri öuadovias elayyektov. Ebed
jesu also remarks, "Eusebius Caesariensis composuit librum solutionis contradictionum evangelii."
In the sixteenth century there were found in Sicily, according to the announcement of Latino
Latini, "libri tres Eusebii Caesariensis de Evangeliorum diaphonia," but nothing more has been
heard or seen of this Sicilian MS. There can be no doubt that the work referred to under
the title De Evangeliorum Diaphonia is identical with the Gos/c/ Questions and So/utions,
for the discrepancies in the Gospels occupy a considerable space in the Questions and So/usions
as we have it, and the word Sudbová, occurs frequently. The three books mentioned by Latino
Latini were therefore the two books addressed to Stephanus which Eusebius himself refers to, and
the one book addressed to Marinus. The complete work is no longer extant, but an epitome of

PRO LEGOMENA.

it was discovered and published by Mai, together with numerous fragments of the unabridged
work, two of them in Syriac (Bib/. Moza Patrum, IV. 217 sq.; reprinted by Migne, Opera, IV.
In the epitome the work addressed to Stephanus consists of sixteen chapters, and
879-1016).
the division into two books is not retained. The work addressed to Marinus consists of only
four chapters.

The work purports to have been written in answer to questions and difficulties suggested by
Stephanus and Marinus, who are addressed by Eusebius in terms of affection and respect. The
first work is devoted chiefly to a discussion of the genealogies of Christ, as given by Matthew and
Luke ; the second work deals with the apparent discrepancies between the accounts of the resur
rection as given by the different evangelists.
Eusebius does not always reach a solution of the
difficulties, but his work is suggestive and interesting. The question as to the date of the work is
complicated by the fact that there is in the Dem. Evang. VII. 3 a reference to the Questions and
Solutions addressed to Stephanus, while in the epitome of the latter work (Quaest. VII. § 7)
there is a distinct reference to the Demonstratio Evang.
This can be satisfactorily explained
only by supposing, with Lightfoot, that the Epitome was made at a later date than the original
work, and that then Eusebius inserted this reference to the Demonstratio. We are thus led to
assume two editions of this work, as of others of Eusebius' writings, the second edition being a
revised abridgment of the first. The first edition, at least of the Quaestiones ad Stephanum,
must have been published before the Demonstratio Evangelica. We cannot fix the date of the
epitome, nor of the Quaestiones ad Marinum.

Commentary on the Psalms (eis rows laxplois).

This commentary is extant entire as far as
the 118th psalm, but from that point to the end only fragments of it have been preserved.
It
was first published in 1707, by Montfaucon, who, however, knew nothing of the fragments of the

latter part of the work.
Patrum, IV. 65 sq.), and the entire extant work, including these fragments, is printed by Migne,
Opera, V. and VI. 9-76.
According to Lightfoot, notices of extant Syriac extracts from it are
found in Wright's Catal. Syr. MSS. Brit. Mus. pp. 35 sq. and 125. Jerome (de vir. isl. 96
and Ep. ad Vigilantium, $ 2 ; Migne's ed. Ep. 61) informs us that Eusebius of Vercellae trans

extant. The commentary had a high reputation among the Fathers, and justly so.
It is distin
guished for its learning, industry, and critical acumen. The Hexapla is used with great diligence,
and the author frequently corrects the received LXX. text of his day upon the authority of one
of the other versions. The work betrays an acquaintance with Hebrew, uncommon among the
Fathers, but by no means extensive or exact.
Eusebius devotes considerable attention to the
historical relations of the Psalms, and exhibits an unusual degree of good judgment in their treat
ment, but the allegorical method of the school of Origen is conspicuous, and leads him into the
mystical extravagances so common to patristic exegesis.

The work must have been written after the close of the persecution and the death of the
persecutors (in Psal. XXXVI. 12).
In another passage (in Pas. LXXXVII. 11) there seems to
be a reference to the discovery of the site of the Holy Sepulchre and the erection of Constantine's
basilica upon it (see Visa Const. III. 28, 3o, &c.). The basilica was dedicated in the year 335
(see above, p. 24), and the site of the sepulchre was not discovered until the year 326, or later
(see Lightfoot, p. 336). The commentary must have been written apparently after the basilica
was begun, and probably after its completion.
If so, it is to be placed among the very latest of
Eusebius' works.

Commentary on Isaiah (tropovijuara els "Horațav).

This work is also extant almost entire, and
was first published in 1706, by Montfaucon (Col/ Nova Patrum et Script. Grace. II. ; reprinted
by Migne, Opera, VI. 77-526).
In his de vir. is/. 81 Jerome refers to it as containing ten books
(in Isaiam libri decem), but in the preface to his Comment. in Isaiam he speaks of it as com
posed of fifteen (Eusebius quoque Pamphili juxta historicam explanationem quindecim ediait

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF EU SEBIUS.

4 I

zo/umina).
In its present form there is no trace of a division into books. The commentary is
marked by the same characteristics which were noticed in connection with the one on the Psalms,
though it does not seem to have acquired among the ancients so great a reputation as that work.
It must have been written after the close of the persecution (in Is. XLIV. 5), and apparently
after the accession of Constantine to sole power (in Is. XLIX. 23 compared with Pita Const.
IV. 28).
If the commentary on the Psalms was written toward the close of Eusebius' life, as
assumed above, it is natural to conclude that the present work preceded that.

Commentary on Luke (eis rô karū Aoukāv ei'ayyéAtov).

This work is no longer extant, but
considerable fragments of it exist and have been published by Mai (Bib/. Nova Patrum, IV.
159 sq.; reprinted by Migne, Opera, VI. 529-606).
Although the fragments are all drawn from
Catenae on Luke, there are many passages which seem to have been taken from a commentary
on Matthew (see the notes of the editor). A number of extracts from the work are found in
Eusebius' Theophania (see Mai's introduction to his fragments of the latter work).

The date of the commentary cannot be fixed with certainty, but I am inclined to place it
before the persecution of Diocletian, for the reason that there appears in the work, so far as I have
discovered, no hint of a persecution, although the passages expounded offer many opportunities
for such a reference, which it is difficult to see how the author could have avoided making if a
persecution were in progress while he was writing; and further, because in discussing Christ's
prophecies of victory and dominion over the whole world, no reference is made to the triumph
gained by the Church in the victories of Constantine. A confirmation of this early date may be
found in the extreme simplicity of the exegesis, which displays neither the wide learning, nor the
profound study that mark the commentaries on the Psalms and on Isaiah.

Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians.

This work is no longer extant, and we
know of it only from a reference in Jerome's Ep. ad Pammachium, $ 3 (Migne's ed. Ep.
49) : "Origenes, Dionysius, Pierius, Eusebius Caesariensis, Didymus, Apollinaris latissime hanc
Epistolam interpretati sunt."
Fxegetical Fragments.

Mai has published brief fragments containing expositions of passages
from Proverbs (Bibl. Mova Patrum, IV. 316; reprinted by Migne, Opera, VI. 75-78), from
Daniel (ib. p. 314 ; Migne, VI. 525-528), and from the Epistle so the Hebrews (ib. p. 207; Migne,
VI. 605).
Fabricius mentions also fragments from a commentary on the Song of Songs as
published by Meursius, and says that other commentaries are referred to by Montfaucon in his
Epistola de Therapeutis, p. 151. We have no references in the works of the ancients to any such
commentaries, so far as I am aware, and it is quite possible that the various fragments given by
Mai, as well as those referred to by Fabricius may have been taken not from continuous commen
taries, but from Eusebius' Genera/E/ementary Introduction, or others of his lost works. Accord
ing to Migne (VI. 527) some Greek Catenae published by Cramer in Oxford in the year 1884 con
tain extensive fragments on Matthew and John, which, however, have been taken from Eusebius'
Quaest. Evang.
Other fragments in Catenae on the same Evangelists and on Mark, have been
taken, according to Migne, from the Quaessiones ad Stephanum, or from the Commensary on Luke.
It is, however, quite possible, as it seems to me, that Eusebius wrote a commentary on Daniel.
At any rate, the exegetical fragments which we have, taken with the extended discussions of certain
passages found in the Dem. Evang. VIII. 2 and in the Ec/ogae Pro/h. III. 40 sq., show that he
expounded at one time or another a considerable portion of the book.

VI. BIBLICAL DICTIONARIES.

No other ancient authority mentions the work so far as I am aware.

It is remarked by Fabricius that this work is evidently intended by Ebedjesu in his catalogue,
where he mentions among the writings of Eusebius a Librum de Figura Mundi (cf. Assemani's
Bis/. Orient. III. p. 18, note 7).

Both are published by Vallarsi in Hieronymi Opera, III.
Migne, in his edition of Eusebius' works, omits the 7opica and refers to his edition of
122 sq.
Jerome's works, where, however, he gives only Jerome's version, not the original Greek (III.
859-928). The best editions of the Greek text are by Larsow and Parthey (Euseb. Pamph. Episc.
Caes. Onomasticon, &c., Berolini, 1862), and by Lagarde (Onomastica Sacra, I. 207-304, Got
tingae, 1870). The work aims to give, in the original language, in alphabetical order, the names
of the cities, villages, mountains, rivers, &c., mentioned in the Scriptures, together with their
modern designations and brief descriptions of each. The work is thus of the same character as
a modern dictionary or Biblical geography. The other three works were narrower than this
one in their scope, but seem also to have been arranged somewhat on the dictionary plan. The
work is dedicated to Paulinus, a fact which leads us to place its composition before 325 A.D.,
when Paulinus was already dead (see below, p. 369).
Jerome, in the preface to his version,
says that Eusebius wrote the work after his History and Chronicle. We are to conclude, then,
either that the work was published in 324 or early in 325, within a very few months after the
//istory, or, what is more probable, that Jerome is mistaken in his statement. He is proverbially
careless and inaccurate, and Eusebius, neither in his preface - from which Jerome largely quotes
in his own-nor in the work itself, gives any hint of the fact that his History and Chronicle were
already written.

In his Visa Cons/. IV. 33 Eusebius informs us
that he delivered an oration on this subject (&plot too orotmotov povijuatos Aóyos) in the presence
of the Emperor at Constantinople.
In the same work, IV. 46, he says that he wrote a descrip

addressed to the Emperor (ěv oiketo ovyypáupart trapabóvres, airò Baoroet Tpoore®ovisorapev).
If
these two are identical, as has always been assumed, the Oration on the Sepulchre must have
been delivered in 335, when Eusebius went to Constantinople, just after the dedication of the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (see above, p. 23), and just before the Oratio de
/audibus Constantini (see ib. IV. 46). That the two are identical has always been assumed, and
seems most probable. At the same time it is worthy of notice that in IV. 33 Eusebius speaks as
if he returned to Caesarea immediately after delivering his oration, and gives no hint of the
delivery of his De laud. Const, at that time.
It is noticeable also that he speaks in IV. 46 of a
work (oréyypappa) not of an oration (Aóyos), and that in IV. 45 he mentions the fact that he has
described the splendid edifice and gifts of the Emperor in writing (8tà ypsippiaros), which
would seem to imply something else than an address.
Finally, it is to be observed that, whereas, in
IV. 46, he expressly refers to the church erected by Constantine and to his rich gifts in connection
with its construction, in IV. 33 he refers only to the sepulchre.
It appears to me, in fact, quite
possible that Eusebius may be referring to two entirely different compositions, the one an oration
delivered after the discovery of the sepulchre and before the Emperor had built the church
(perhaps containing the suggestion of such a building), the other a descriptive work written after
the completion of that edifice.
I present this only as a possibility, for I realize that against it
may be urged the unlikelihood that two separate works should have been composed by Eusebius
upon subjects so nearly, if not quite, identical, and also the probability that, if there were two,
both, and not one only, would have been attached to the end of the Vita Const, with the De
/aud Const. (see IV. 46).
Neither the Oration on the Sepulchre of the Saviour nor the IWork
on the Church and the Sepulchre (whether the two are the same or not) is now extant.

PROLEGOMENA.

VIII. EPISTLES.

To Alexander, bishop of Alexandria. The purpose and the character of this epistle have
been already discussed (see above, p. oo). A fragment of it has been preserved in the Proceed
ings of the Second Council of Nicaea, Act VI., Tom. V. (Jabbei et Cossarsii Conc. VII. col. 497).
For a translation of the epistle, see below, p. 7o.
This and the following epistle were written
after the outbreak of the Arian controversy, but before the Nicene Council.

To Euphrasion, bishop of Balaneae in Syria, likewise a strong opponent of the Arians (see
Athan. de Fuga, 3 ; His/. Ar. ad Mon. 5).
Athanasius states that this epistle declared plainly
that Christ is not God (Athan. de Synod. 17). A brief fragment of it has been preserved in the
Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea (/.c.), which probably contains the very passage to which
Athanasius refers. Upon the interpretation and significance of the fragment, see above, p. 15.

To Constantia Augusta, the sister of Constantine and wife of Licinius.

Constantia had written
to Eusebius requesting him to send her a certain likeness of Christ of which she had heard.
Eusebius, in this epistle, rebukes her, and speaks strongly against the use of such representations,

fragments of it have been discovered, so that we have it now almost entire.
It is printed in
Migne, Opera, II. 1545-1550. We have no means of ascertaining the date at which it was written.
This epistle was written from Nicaea in 325 A.D., during or
immediately after the Council.
Its purpose and character have been discussed above on p. 16 sq.,
where a translation of it is given. The epistle is preserved by Athanasius (de Decret. Syn. Mic.
app.); by Socrates, H. E. I. 8; by Theodoret, H. E. I. 11, and others.
It is printed by
Migne, Opera, II. 1535-1544.

To the Church of Caesarea.

In the Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea (/.c.) we find a mention of "all the epistles"
of Eusebius, as if many were at that time extant. We know, however, only of those which have
been mentioned above.

IX.

SPURIOUS OR DOUBTFUL WORKS.

Fourteen Latin opuscula were discovered and published by Sirmond in 1643, and have been
frequently reprinted (Migne, Opera, VI. 1047-1208). They are of a theological character, and
bear the following titles: -

De fide adv. Sabellium, libri duo.
De Resurrectione, /i/ri duo.
De Incorporali et invisibisi Deo.
De Incorporali.
De Incorporali Anima.
De Spiritali Cogitatu hominis.
De eo quod Deus Pater incorporalis ess, libri duo.
De co quod aif Dominus, Mon went pacem, etc.
De Mandato Domini, Quod ait, Quod dico vobis in aure, etc.
De operious bonis et malis.
De operious bonis, ex epist. II. ad Corinth.

Their authenticity is a matter of dispute.

Some of them may be genuine, but Lardner is
doubtless right in denying the genuineness of the two Against Sabellius, which are the most
important of all (see Lardner's Credibility, Part II. chap. 72).

-

Lightfoot states that a treatise, On the Star which appeared to the Magi, was published by
Wright in the Journal of Sacred Literature (1866) from a Syriac MS.
It is ascribed to Eusebius,
but its genuineness has been disputed, and good reasons have been given for supposing that it
was written originally in Syriac (see Lightfoot, p. 345).

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF EU SEBIUS.

Fabricius (Bio/. Gr. VI. 104) reports that the following works are extant in MS. : Fragmen
tum de Mensuris ac Ponderious (MSS. Is. Vossii, n. 179); De Morte Herodis (MS. in Bibl.
Basil.); Prasatio ad Canticum Mosis in Exodo (Lambec. III. p. 35).

CHAPTER III.

EUSEBIUS' CHURCH HISTORY.

§ 1.

Date of its Composition.

This gives a fixed terminus a quo.

THE work with which we are especially concerned at this time is the Church History, the
original Greek of which is still extant in numerous MSS.
It consists of ten books, to which is
added in most of the MSS. the shorter form of the Martyrs of Palestine (see above, p. 29).
The date of the work can be determined with considerable exactness.
It closes with a eulogy
of Constantine and his son Crispus; and since the latter was put to death by his father in
the summer of 326, the History must have been completed before that time. On the other hand,
in the same chapter Eusebius refers to the defeat of Licinius, which took place in the year
323 A.D.
It is not quite certain from Eusebius' words
whether the death of Licinius had already taken place at the time he wrote, but it seems probable
that it had, and if so, the completion of the work must be put as late as the summer of 324. On
the other hand, not the slightest reference is made to the Council of Nicaea, which met in the
summer of 325; and still further the tenth book is dedicated to Paulinus, at one time bishop of
Tyre and afterward bishop of Antioch (see Euseb. Contra Marc. I. 4, and Philost. H. A. III.
15), who was already dead in the summer of 325 : for at the Nicene Council, Zeno appears as
bishop of Tyre, and Eustathius as bishop of Antioch (see for further particulars Lightfoot, p. 322).
We are thus led to place the completion of the History in the year 324, or, to give the widest
possible limits, between the latter part of 323 and the early part of 325 A.D.

But the question has been raised whether the earlier books may not have been composed
some years before this.
Lightfoot (following Westcott) supposes that the first nine books were
completed not long after the edict of Milan and before the outbreak of the quarrel between Con
stantine and Licinius in 314.
There is considerable to be said in favor of this theory. The
language used in the dedication of the tenth book seems to imply that the nine books had been
completed some time before, and that the tenth is added as a sort of postscript. The close of
the ninth book strengthens that conclusion.
Moreover, it would seem from the last sentences
of that book that Constantine and Licinius were in perfect harmony at the time it was written,
a state of affairs which did not exist after 314. On the other hand, it must be noticed that in
Book IX. chap. 9 Licinius' "madness" is twice referred to as having "not yet" seized him (in
§ 1 outro pavévros tore, and in § 12 outro róre éð' jv to repov čkirétroke paviav, rijv Štávotav Krparéis).
It is necessary either to interpret both these clauses as later insertions (possibly by Eusebius' own
hand at the time when he added the tenth book; cf. also p. 30, above), or to throw the com

position of the ninth book down to the year 319 or later.
alternatives, but I am inclined on the whole to think that Westcott's theory is probably correct,
and that the two clauses can best be interpreted as later insertions. The very nature of his
History would at any rate lead us to think that Eusebius spent some years in the composition
of it, and that the earlier books, if not published, were at least completed long before the issue
of the ten books as a whole. The Chronicle is referred to as already written in I. 1 ; the Eclogae
Proph. (? see below, p. 85) in I. 2 and 6; the Collection of Ancient Martyrdoms in IV. 15,
V. preface, 4, and 22 ; the Defense of Origen in VI. 23, 33, and 36; the Zife of Pamphilus in
In VIII. 13 Eusebius speaks also of his intention of relating the

sufferings of the martyrs in another work (but see above, p. 30).

§ 2.

The Author's Design.

That the composition of a history of the Church was Eusebius' own idea, and was not due to
any suggestion from without, seems clear, both from the absence of reference to any one else as
prompting it, and from the lack of a dedication at the beginning of the work. The reasons which
led him to undertake its composition seem to have been both scientific and apologetic. He lived,
and he must have realized the fact, at the opening of a new age in the history of the Church.
He believed, as he frequently tells us, that the period of struggle had come to an end, and that
the Church was now about entering upon a new era of prosperity. He must have seen that it was
a peculiarly fitting time to put on record for the benefit of posterity the great events which had
taken place within the Church during the generations that were past, to sum up in one narrative
all the trials and triumphs which had now emerged in this final and greatest triumph, which he
was witnessing. He wrote, as any historian of the present day would write, for the information
and instruction of his contemporaries and of those who should come after, and yet there was in
his mind all the time the apologetic purpose, the desire to exhibit to the world the history of
Christianity as a proof of its divine origin and efficacy. The plan which he proposed to himself
is stated at the very beginning of his work: "It is my purpose to write an account of the succes
sions of the holy apostles, as well as of the times which have elapsed from the days of our Saviour
to our own ; and to relate how many and how important events are said to have occurred in the
history of the Church; and to mention those who have governed and presided over the Church
in the most prominent parishes, and those who in each generation have proclaimed the divine
word either orally or in writing.
It is my purpose also to give the names and the number and
the times of those who through love of innovation have run into the greatest errors, and pro
claiming themselves discoverers of knowledge, falsely so-called, have, like fierce wolves, unmer
cifully devastated the flock of Christ.
It is my intention, moreover, to recount the misfortunes
which immediately came upon the whole Jewish nation in consequence of their plots against our
Saviour, and to record the ways and the times in which the divine word has been attacked by the
Gentiles, and to describe the character of those who at various periods have contended for it in
the face of blood and tortures, as well as the confessions which have been made in our own days,
and finally the gracious and kindly succour which our Saviour afforded them all."
It will be seen
that Eusebius had a very comprehensive idea of what a history of the Church should comprise,
and that he was fully alive to its importance.

§ 3.

Eusebius as a Historian.

The Merits and Defects of his History.

The whole Christian world has reason to be thankful that there lived at the opening of the
fourth century a man who, with his life spanning one of the greatest epochs that has occurred
in the history of the Church, with an intimate experimental knowledge of the old and of the new
condition of things, was able to conceive so grand a plan and possessed the means and the ability
to carry it out.
Had he written nothing else, Eusebius' Church History would have made him
immortal; for if immortality be a fitting reward for large and lasting services, few possess a clearer
title to it than the author of that work. The value of the History to us lies not in its literary
merit, but in the wealth of the materials which it furnishes for a knowledge of the early Church.
How many prominent figures of the first three centuries are known to us only from the pages of
Eusebius; how many fragments, priceless on account of the light which they shed upon move
ments of momentous and far-reaching consequence, have been preserved by him alone; how
often a hint dropped, a casual statement made in passing, or the mention of some apparently
trifling event, gives the clue which enables us to unravel some perplexing labyrinth, or to fit into
one whole various disconnected and apparently unrelated elements, and thus to trace the steps
in the development of some important historical movement whose rise and whose bearing must

and Montanism, and little appreciation of their real nature, and yet our knowledge of their true
significance and of their place in history is due in considerable part to facts respecting the move.
ments or their leaders which Eusebius alone has recorded or preserved. To understand the
development of the Logos Christology we must comprehend the significance of the teaching of
Paul of Samosata, and how inadequate would our knowledge of the nature of that teaching be
without the epistle quoted in Book VII. chap. 30. How momentous were the consequences of the
paschal controversies, and how dark would they be were it not for the light shed upon them by
our author. How important, in spite of their tantalizing brevity and obscurity, the fragments
of Papias' writings; how interesting the extracts from the memoirs of Hegesippus ; how sugges
tive the meager notices from Dionysius of Corinth, from Victor of Rome, from Melito, from Caius;
how instructive the long and numerous quotations from the epistles of Dionysius of Alexandria
He may often fail to appreciate the significance of the events which he records, he may in many
cases draw unwarranted conclusions from the premises which he states, he may sometimes misin
terpret his documents and misunderstand men and movements, but in the majority of cases he
presents us with the material upon which to form our own judgments, and if we differ with him
we must at the same time thank him for the data which have enabled us independently to reach
other results.

But the value of Eusebius' Church History does not lie solely in the fact that it contains so
many original sources which would be otherwise unknown to us.
It is not merely a thesaurus, it
is a history in the truest sense, and it possesses an intrinsic value of its own, independent of its
quotations from other works.
Eusebius possessed extensive sources of knowledge no longer
accessible to us.
His History contains the results of his extended perusal of many works which
are now irrecoverably lost, of his wide acquaintance with the current traditions of his day, of his
familiar intercourse with many of the chief men of the age.
If we cut out all the documents
which he quotes, there still remains an extensive history whose loss would leave an irreparable
blank in our knowledge of the early Church. How invaluable, for instance, to mention but one
matter, are the researches of our author in regard to the circulation of the books of the New
Testament: his testimony to the condition of the canon in his own time, and to the more or less
widespread use of particular writings by the Fathers of preceding centuries.
Great as is the
value of the sources which Eusebius quotes, those that he does not give are still more extensive,
and it is the knowledge gained from them which he has transmitted to us.

The worth of these portions of his History must depend in the first place upon the extent and

reliability of his sources, and in the second place upon the use which he made of them.

A glance at the list of his authorities given in the index, reveals at once the immense
range of his materials. The number of books which he either quotes or refers to as read is
enormous. When to these are added the works employed by him in the composition of his
Praep. Evang., as well as the great number which he must have perused, but does not mention,
we are amazed at the extent of his reading. He must have been a voracious reader from his
earliest years, and he must have possessed extraordinary acquisitive powers.
It is safe to say
that there was among the Fathers, with the possible exception of Origen, no more learned man
than he. He thus possessed one of the primary qualifications of the historian. And yet even in
this respect he had his limitations. He seems to have taken no pains to acquaint himself with the
works of heretics, but to have been content to take his knowledge of them at second hand. And
still further, he was sadly ignorant of Latin literature and of the Latin Church in general (see
below, p. 106); in fact, we must not expect to glean from his History a very thorough or extended
knowledge of western Christendom.

But his sources were not confined to literary productions. He had a wide acquaintance with
the world, and he was enabled to pick up much from his intercourse with other men and with
different peoples that he could not have found upon the shelves of the Caesarean or of any other

PROLEGOMENA.

library.
Moreover, he had access to the archives of state, and gathered from them much informa
tion quite inaccessible to most men. He was thus peculiarly fitted, both by nature and by cir
cumstances, for the task of acquiring material, the first task of the genuine historian.

But the value of his work must depend in the second place upon the wisdom and honesty with
which he used his sources, and upon the faithfulness and accuracy with which he reproduced the
results thus reached. We are therefore led to enquire as to his qualifications for this part of his
work.

We notice, in the first place, that he was very diligent in the use of his sources. Nothing seems
to have escaped him that might in any way bear upon the particular subject in hand. When he
informs us that a certain author nowhere mentions a book or an event, he is, so far as I am
aware, never mistaken. When we realize how many works he read entirely through for the sake
of securing a single historical notice, and how many more he must have read without finding any
thing to his purpose, we are impressed with his untiring diligence.
To-day, with our convenient
indexes, and with the references at hand which have been made by many other men who have
studied the writings of the ancients, we hardly comprehend what an amount of labor the pro
duction of a History like Eusebius' must have cost him, a pioneer in that kind of work.

In the second place, we are compelled to admire the sagacity which our author displays in the
selection of his materials. He possessed the true instinct of the historian, which enabled him to
pick out the salient points and to present to the reader just that information which he most
desires. We shall be surprised upon examining his work to see how little it contains which it is
not of the utmost importance for the student of early Church history to know, and how shrewdly
the author has anticipated most of the questions which such a student must ask. He saw what
it was in the history of the first three centuries of the Church which posterity would most desire

to know, and he told them.
pared with the unwisdom of most of his successors, who filled their works with legends of saints
and martyrs, which, however fascinating they may have been to the readers of that age, possess
little either of interest or of value for us. When he wishes to give us a glimpse of the persecu
tions of those early days, his historical and literary instinct leads him to dwell especially upon two
thoroughly representative cases, - the martyrdom of Polycarp and the sufferings of the churches of
Lyons and Vienne, - and to preserve for posterity two of the noblest specimens of martyrological
literature which the ancient Church produced.
It is true that he sometimes erred in his judg
ment as to the wants of future readers; we could wish that he had been somewhat fuller and
clearer on many points, and that he had not so entirely neglected some others; but on the whole
I am of the opinion that few historical works, ancient or modern, have in the same compass
better fulfilled their mission in this respect.

In the third place, we can hardly fail to be impressed by the wisdom with which Eusebius
discriminated between reliable and unreliable sources. Judged by the modern standard he may
fall short as a literary critic, but judged by the standard of antiquity he must be given a very high
rank.
Few indeed are the historians of ancient times, secular or ecclesiastical, who can compare
with Eusebius for sound judgment in this matter. The general freedom of his work from the
fables and prodigies, and other improbable or impossible tales which disfigure the pages of the
great majority even of the soberest of ancient historians, is one of its most marked features. He
shows himself uncommonly particular in demanding good evidence for the circumstances which
he records, and uncommonly shrewd in detecting spurious and unreliable sources. When we
remember the great number of pseudonymous works which were current in his day we are
compelled to admire his care and his discrimination.
Not that he always succeeded in detecting
the false.
More than once he was sadly at fault (as for instance in regard to the Abgarus corre
spondence and Josephus' testimony to Christ), and has in consequence been severely denounced
or held up to unsparing ridicule by many modern writers.
But the wonder certainly is not that
he erred as often as he did, but that he did not err oftener; not that he was sometimes careless in

regard to the reliability of his sources, but that he was ever as careful as, in the majority of cases,

believe that emphasis should be laid upon this point for the reason that Eusebius' reputation has
often suffered sadly in consequence of the unjust imputations, and the violent accusations, which
it was for a long time the fashion to make against him, and which lead many still to treat his
statements with distrust, and his character with contempt.
Gibbon's estimate of his honesty is

these and other candid passages in his work, it is the sheerest injustice to charge him with dis
honesty and unfairness because he prefers, as almost any Christian historian must, to dwell with
greater fullness of detail upon the bright than upon the dark side of the picture.
Scientific,
Eusebius' method, in this respect, doubtless is not ; but dishonest, no one has a right to call it.
The most severe attack which has been made upon Eusebius in recent years is found in an article
by Jachmann (see below, p. 55). The evident animus which runs through his entire paper is
very unpleasant; the conclusions which he draws are, to say the least, strained.
I cannot enter
here into a consideration of his positions; most of them are examined below in the notes upon
the various passages which he discusses. The whole article, like most similar attacks, proceeds
upon the supposition that our author is guilty, and then undertakes simply to find evidence
of that which is already presupposed.
I submit that few writers could endure such an ordeal.
If Eusebius is tried according to the principles of common justice, and of sound literary criti
cism, I am convinced, after long and careful study, that his sincerity and honesty of purpose
cannot be impeached. The particular instances which have been urged as proving his dishonesty
will be discussed below in the notes upon the respective passages, and to those the reader is
referred (compare especially pp. 88, 98, Ioo, I I I, 1 12, 1 14, 127, 194).

Eusebius' critics are wont to condemn him severely for what they are pleased to call the

anything in it which leads me to entertain for a moment a suspicion of the author's honesty.
It
is true that Eusebius emphasizes the Emperor's good qualities, and fails to mention the darker
spots in his character; but so far as I am aware he misstates no facts, and does only what
those who eulogize deceased friends are accustomed to do the world over.
For a discussion
of this matter the reader is referred to the prolegomena of Dr. Richardson, pp. 467 sq. of this
volume.
I am pleased to learn from him that his study of the Vita has shown him nothing which
justifies the charge of dishonesty brought against Eusebius.

One of the most decisive marks of veracity upon the part of our author is the frankness with
which he confesses his lack of knowledge upon any subject (cf. IV. 5), and the care with which
he distinguishes between the different kinds of evidence upon which he bases his statements.
How frequently the phrases Aéyos oxes, bags, Aéyéral, &c., occur in connection with accounts which
a less scrupulous historian would not hesitate to record as undoubted fact.
How particular
he is to mention his sources for any unusual or startling event.

quite inadequate, he simply omits all reference to an occurrence which most of his con

material from which to form our own judgments.

He is often blamed by modern writers for what they are pleased to call his excessive
credulity. Those who accuse him thus seem to forget that he lived in the fourth, not in the
nineteenth century.

of a skepticism uncommon in his age than of an excessive and unusual credulity.
Gibbon
himself gives our author due credit in this respect, when he speaks of his character as "less
tinctured with credulity, and more practiced in the arts of courts, than that of almost any of his
contemporaries" (Decline and Fa//, chap. XVI.).

On the other hand, Eusebius as an historian had many very grave faults which it is not my
wish in the least to palliate or conceal. One of the most noticeable of these is his complete lack
of any conception of historiography as a fine art. His work is interesting and instructive because
of the facts which it records, but that interest is seldom if ever enhanced by his mode of presen
tation.
There is little effective grouping, almost no sense of perspective, utter ignorance of
the art of suggesting by a single line or phrase a finished picture of a man or of a movement.
He was not, in other words, a Thucydides or a Tacitus; but the world has seen not many such
as they.

A second and still more serious fault is our author's want of depth, if I may so express myself
his failure to look beneath the surface and to grasp the real significance of things, to trace the
influence of opinions and events. We feel this defect upon every page. We read the annals,
but we are conscious of no masterful mind behind them, digesting and comprehending them into

perhaps most clearly in his superficial and transcendental treatment of heretics and heresies,
his failure to appreciate their origin and their bearing upon the progress of Christian thought.
Of a development in theology, in fact, he knows nothing, and hence his work lacks utterly
that which we now look upon as the most instructive part of Church history, - the history
of doctrine.

In the third place, severe censure must be passed upon our author for his carelessness and
inaccuracy in matters of chronology. We should expect that one who had produced the most
extensive chronological work that had ever been given to the world, would be thoroughly at
home in that province, but in truth his chronology is the most defective feature of his work.
The difficulty is chiefly due to his inexcusable carelessness, we might almost say slovenliness, in
the use of different and often contradictory sources of information.
Instead of applying himself
to the discrepancies, and endeavoring to reach the truth by carefully weighing the respective
merits of the sources, or by testing their conclusions in so far as tests are possible, he adopts in
many cases the results of both, apparently quite unsuspicious of the confusion consequent upon
such a course.
In fact, the critical spirit which actuates him in dealing with many other matters
seems to leave him entirely when he is concerned with chronology; and instead of proceeding with
the care and circumspection of an historian, he accepts what he finds with the unquestioning faith

of a child. There is no case in which he can be convicted of disingenuousness, but at times his
obtuseness is almost beyond belief. An identity of names, or a resemblance between events
recorded by different authors, will often be enough to lead him all unconsciously to himself into
the most absurd and contradictory conclusions.
Instances of this may be seen in Book I. chap.
5, and in II. 1 1.
His confusion in regard to the various Antonines (see especially the note on the
preface to Book V.) is not at all unusual among the writers of his day, and in view of the frequent
and perplexing use of the same names by the different emperors, might be quite excusable in a
less scholarly man than Eusebius, but in his case it is evidence of unpardonable want of care.
This serious defect in our author's method is not peculiar to him. Many historians, critical
almost to a fault in most matters, accept the received chronology without question, and build

chapter.
The author does not confine himself as strictly as he should to the logical limits of the subject
which he is treating, but allows himself to be led away from the main point by the suggestions
that pour in upon him from all sides.
As Lightfoot remarks, "We have not unfrequently to pick
out from various parts of his work the notices bearing on one definite and limited subject. He
relates a fact, or quotes an authority bearing upon it, in season or out of season, according as
it is recalled to his memory by some accidental connexion."
This unfortunate habit of Eusebius'
is one into which men of wide learning are very apt to fall. The richness of their acquisitions
embarrasses them, and the immense number of facts in their possession renders a comprehension
of them all into one logical whole very difficult; and yet unless the facts be thus comprehended,
unless they be thoroughly digested and arranged, the result is confusion and obscurity.

as it is extensive, with a grasp as strong as its reach is wide, can accomplish it, and few are the
minds that are blessed with both qualities.
Few are the writers whose histories stand upon our
shelves that fail not sadly in the one or in the other; and in few perhaps does the failure seem
more marked than in our author.

And yet, though it is apparent that the value of Eusebius' work is greatly impaired by its
desultory method of treatment, I am confident that the defect is commonly exaggerated. The
paragraph which Lightfoot quotes from Westcott on this subject leaves a false impression.
Altogether too often our author introduces irrelevant matters, and repeats himself when repetition
"mars the symmetry of his work"; and yet on the whole he follows a fairly well ordered plan
with fairly good success. He endeavors to preserve a strictly chronological sequence in his
arrangement of the books, and he adheres for the most part to his purpose. Though there may
be disorder and confusion within the various periods, for instance within the apostolic age, the
age of Trajan, of Hadrian, of the Antonines, &c., yet the periods themselves are kept reasonably
distinct from one another, and having finished his account of one of them the author seldom
returns to it.

Editions and Versions.

-

The original Greek of Eusebius' History has been published in many editions. -
1. The editio princeps is that of Robert Stephanus, which appeared at Paris in 1544, and
again, with a few changes, and with the Latin translation of Christophorsonus and the notes of
Suffridus Petrus, at Geneva in 1612.

2. Henr. Valesius (de Valois) published his first edition of the Greek text,with a new Latin trans
lation and with copious critical and explanatory notes, at Paris in 1659.

edition was issued at Paris, which in 1695 was reprinted with some corrections at Amsterdam.
In 1720 Walesius' edition of Eusebius, together with his edition of Socrates, Sozomen, and the
other Greek historians, was republished at Cambridge by William Reading, in three folio volumes.

to Heinichen it is not as accurate as that of 1720.
For the elucidation of Eusebius' History
we owe more to Valesius than to any other man. His edition of the text was an immense advance
upon that of Stephanus, and has formed the basis of all subsequent editions, while his notes
are a perfect storehouse of information from which all annotators of Eusebius have extensively
drawn.

with a reprint of the entire commentary of Walesius, and with the addition of Variorum notes. The

the work.
Forty years later Heinichen published a second edition of the //istory in his Eusebii
Pamphisi Scripta Historica (Lips. 1868-1870, 3 vols.). The first volume contains the Greek text
of the History, with valuable prolegomena, copious critical apparatus and very useful indices; the
second volume contains the Visa Constantini, the Panegyricus or De laudibus Constantini, and
Constantine's Oratio as Sanctorum coefum, also accompanied with critical apparatus and indices;
the third volume contains an extensive commentary upon the works included in the first two
volumes, together with twenty-nine valuable excursuses.
This entirely supersedes the first, and
is on the whole the most complete and useful edition of the History which we have. The editor
made diligent use of the labors of his predecessors, especially of Laemmer's.
He did no inde

to Mr. Osborne Gordon of Christ Church. The same Press also in 1845 issued in a single
volume for the use of students, and again, in 1856, Burton's text alone, without the critical
apparatus.
Burton made large contributions to the criticism of the text, and had he lived to
superintend the issue of these successive editions, would perhaps have succeeded in giving us

inaccuracy of those who collated MSS. for him.
His text, however, has been reprinted at
Oxford, first in 1872, and again in 1881, under the careful supervision of Canon Bright, D.D.,
Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History.
The typography of these reprints is superb, and
the admirable plan is followed of discarding quotation marks and printing all citations in
smaller type, thus making plain to the eye at a glance what is Eusebius' own and what is
another's. The text is preceded by a very interesting and graphic life of the historian.
This
is a very handy edition, and for school use is unsurpassed.

9. Finally must be mentioned the text of Dindorf (Lips. 1871), which is published in the
Teubner series, and like most of the volumes of that series is handy and convenient, but of little
value to the critical student.

There are few writings of the Fathers which more sadly need and more richly deserve a new
critical edition than the History of Eusebius. The material for the formation of a reliable text is
extensive and accessible, but editors have contented themselves too much in the past with the
results of their predecessors' labors, and unfortunately those labors have not always been accurate
and thorough.
As a consequence a new and more careful collation of most of the MSS. of the
original, together with those of Rufinus' translation, must lie at the foundation of any new work
which is to be done in this line. The publication of the Syriac version will doubtless furnish much
valuable material which the next editor of the History will be able to use to advantage. Anything

be based upon extensive and independent labors, it will be little if any improvement upon
that of Heinichen.
It is to be hoped that a critical text, up to the standard of those of some
other patristic works which we already possess, may yet be issued, which shall give us this, one
of the noblest productions of the ancient Church, in a fitting and satisfactory form.

Translations of Eusebius' History are very numerous.

Probably the earliest of all is the ancient
Syriac version which is preserved in great part in two MSS., one of which is at St. Petersburg and
contains the entire History with the exception of Book VI. and large portions of Books V. and
VII. The MS. is dated 462 A.D. (see Wright's description of it in his Casa/ogue of the Syriac
A/S.S. in the British Museum acquired since the year 1838, Part III. p. xv. sq.). The second
MS. is in the British Museum, and contains Books I-V., with some mutilations at the beginning
of the first book. The MS. dates from the sixth century (see Wright's description of it in his
Catalogue, p. 1039). From these MSS. Wright was engaged in preparing an edition of the Syriac,

it can soon be issued by some one else I have not yet learned. The version was probably made
at a very early date, possibly within the lifetime of Eusebius himself, though of that we can have
no assurance.
I understand that it confirms in the main the Greek text as now printed in our
best editions.

PROLEGOMENA.

The original Latin version was made by Rufinus in the early years of the fifth century. He
translated only nine books, and added to them two of his own, in which he brought the history
down to the death of Theodosius the Great. He allowed himself his customary license in trans
lating, and yet, although his version is by no means exact, it is one of our best sources for a
knowledge of the true text of Eusebius, for it is possible, in many doubtful cases where our MSS.
are hopelessly divided, to ascertain from his rendering what stood in the original Greek.
The version of Rufinus had a large circulation, and became in the Western Church a substitute

for the original throughout the Middle Ages.
(ib. p. 59), in 1476 at Rome, afterward a great many times there and elsewhere". The first
critical edition, which still remains the best, is that of Cacciari (Rome, 1740), which has become
rare, and is very difficult to find. A new edition is a great desideratum. An important work
upon Rufinus' version is Kimmel's De Rufino Eusebii Interprete, Gerae, 1838.

A new Latin translation, by Wolfgang Musculus, was published in Basle, in 1549, and again

improvement upon all that had preceded it, and has been many times reprinted in other
editions of Eusebius as well as in his own.

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF EUSEBIUS.

A second German translation of the entire History (with the exception of the Martyrs of
Palestine, and the Oration on the Building of the Churches, X. 4), together with the Zife of
Constantine, was published by F. A. Stroth in Quedlinburg in 1777, in two volumes.
Stroth
prefaced the translation with a very valuable Life of Eusebius, and added a number of excellent
notes of his own. The translation is reasonably accurate.

A much more elegant German version (including the Oration, but omitting the Martyrs of

Pulestine) was published by Closs in Stuttgart in 1839, in one volume.

sometimes secured at the expense of faithfulness.
In fact the author has aimed to produce a
free, rather than a literal translation, and has occasionally allowed himself to depart too far
from the original. A few brief notes, most of them taken from Walesius or Stroth, accompany
the translation.

More recently a German translation has been published by Stigloher (Kempten, 188o) in the
Kempten Bibliothek der Kirchenväter.
It purports to be a new translation, but is practically
nothing more than a poorly revised edition of Closs' version. The changes which are made are
seldom improvements.

Fabricius mentions a French translation by Claudius Seysselius, but does not give the date of
it, and I have not myself seen it.
Dr. Richardson, however, informs me that he has a copy of
this translation (which is from the Latin, not from the Greek) bearing the following title: L'His

upon its predecessors, but is nevertheless very faulty and unsatisfactory. The translator is not
thoroughly at home in the English, and, moreover, his version is marred by many serious omis
sions and interpolations which reveal an inexcusable degree of carelessness on his part.

Literature.

Kestner, de Eusebii //istoria

The literature upon Eusebius' History is very extensive.

Many of the editions already
mentioned discuss, in their prolegomena, the History itself and Eusebius' character as a historian,
as do also all the lives of Eusebius referred to above, and all the larger histories of the Church.
In addition to these we have numerous important monographs and essays, of which the following
may be mentioned here: Möller, de Fide Eusebii in rebus christianis enarrandis, Havn. 1813;
This was mentioned in
Danz, de Eusebio Caesariensi Hist. Ecclesiastica. Scriptore, Jenae, 1815.

Its chief importance lies
in its treatment of the sources of the Church History, to which the author devotes the whole of

TESTIMONIES OF THE ANCIENTS IN FAVOR OF

EUSEBIUS."

Afrom Constantine's Letter to the Antiochians (in Eusebius' Life of Constantine, Book III.
chap. 60).

"I confess, then, that on reading your records I perceived, by the highly eulogistic testimony
which they bear to Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea (whom I have myself long well known and
esteemed for his learning and moderation), that you are strongly attached to him and desire to
appropriate him as your own prelate. What thoughts then do you suppose that I entertain on
this subject, desirous as I am to seek for and act on the strict principles of right? What anxiety
do you imagine this desire of yours has caused me? O holy faith, who givest us in our Saviour's
words and precepts a model, as it were, of what our life should be, how hardly wouldst thou
thyself resist the course of sin were it not that thou refusest to subserve the purposes of gain
In my own judgment, he whose first object is the maintenance of peace seems to be superior to
Victory herself; and where a right and honorable course lies open to one's choice, surely no one
would hesitate to adopt it.
I ask then, brethren, why do we so decide as to inflict an injury
on others by our choice? Why do we covet those objects which will destroy the credit of our
own character?
I myself highly esteem the individual whom ye judge worthy of your respect
and affection; notwithstanding, it cannot be right that those principles should be entirely disre
garded which should be authoritative and binding on all alike ; for example, that each should be
content with the limits assigned them, and that all should enjoy their proper privileges; nor can
it be right in considering the claims of rival candidates to suppose but that not one only, but many,
may appear worthy of comparison with this person.
For as long as no violence or harshness
are suffered to disturb the dignities of the Church, they continue to be on an equal footing, and
Nor is it reasonable that an enquiry into the
worthy of the same consideration everywhere.
qualifications of one person should be made to the detriment of others; since the judgment of
all churches, whether reckoned of greater importance in themselves, is equally capable of receiving
and maintaining the divine ordinances, so that one is in no way inferior to another (if we will but
boldly declare the truth), in regard to that standard of practice which is common to all.
If this
be so, we must say that you will be chargeable, not with retaining this prelate, but with wrongfully
removing him ; your conduct will be characterized rather by violence than justice ; and whatever
may be generally thought by others, I dare clearly and boldly affirm that this measure will furnish
ground of accusation against you, and will provoke factious disturbances of the most mischievous
kind; for even timid flocks can show the use and power of their teeth when the watchful care
of their shepherd declines, and they find themselves berest of his accustomed guidance.
If this
then be really so, if I am not deceived in my judgment, let this, brethren, be your first considera
tion (for many and important considerations will immediately present themselves, if you adopt
my advice), whether, should you persist in your intention, that mutual kindly feeling and affection
which should subsist among you will suffer no diminution?
In the next place remember that
Eusebius, who came among you for the purpose of offering disinterested counsel, now enjoys the
reward which is due to him in the judgment of heaven; for he has received no ordinary recom
pense in the high testimony you have borne to his equitable conduct.
Lastly, in accordance with
your usual sound judgment, do ye exhibit a becoming diligence in selecting the person of whom
you stand in need, carefully avoiding all factious and tumultuous clamor : for such clamor is
always wrong, and from the collision of discordant elements both sparks and flame will arise."

TESTIMONIES IN FAVOR OF EU SEBIUS.

From the Epistle of Eusebius of AWicomedia, to Paulinus, Bishop of Zyre (given by Theodoret in
his Eccles. Hist. I. 6).

"Neither has the zeal of my lord Eusebius concerning the truth, northy silence in this matter
been unknown, but has reached even us.
And, as was fitting, on the one hand we have rejoiced
on account of my lord Eusebius; but on the other, we are grieved on thy account, since we look
upon the silence of such a man as a condemnation of our cause."

From the Book of Basil, so Amphilochius, on the Holy Spirit (chap. 29).

"If to any one Eusebius of Palestine seem trustworthy on account of his great experience, we

give his own words in the Difficulties concerning the Po/gamy of the Ancients."

From the Book of Questions on the Old and Mew Testaments, which is published among the IWorks
of Augustine (chap. 125).

"We remember to have read in a certain pamphlet of Eusebius, a man formerly distinguished
among the rest of men, that not even the Holy Spirit knows the mystery of the nativity of our
Lord Jesus Christ; and I wonder that a man of so great learning should have imposed this stigma
upon the Holy Spirit."

From Jerome's Epistle to Pammachius and Oceanus (Ep. 65).

"Apollinarius wrote the very strongest books against Porphyry; Eusebius has excellently
composed his Ecc/esiastical History. Of these men, one taught an incomplete human nature
in Christ; the other was a most open defender of the heresy of Arius."

From the Apology of Jerome against Rufinus (Book I. chap. 8).
"As I have already said, Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, formerly leader of the Arian party, has
written six books in defense of Origen - a very extensive and elaborate work; with much evi
dence he has proved that Origen was, from his point of view, a Catholic, that is, from ours, an
Arian."

From the same book (chap. 9).

"I have praised Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History, in his Chronosogica/ Canons, in his

is an Arian P"

From Jerome's second book against Rufinus (chap. 16).

"Eusebius, a very learned man (I have said learned, not Catholic ; lest after the usual man
ner, even in this thing, thou heap calumny upon me), in six volumes does nothing else than show
Origen to be of his own faith; that is, of the Arian heresy."

From the Preface of Jerome's Book on Hebrew Topography.

"Eusebius, who took his surname from the blessed martyr Pamphilus, after the ten books of
his Ecclesiastical History, after his Chronological Canons, which we have published in the Latin
tongue, after his Mames of Various Mations, in which he showed how these were formerly, and
are now, called among the Hebrews; after his Topography of the Land of Judea, with she inheri
tances of the tribes; after his Jerusalem, also, and his Pan of the 7&mple, with a very brief ex//anation, - after all these he has finally in this little work labored that he might collect for us from
Holy Scripture the names of almost all the cities, mountains, rivers, villages, and divers places,
which either remain the same, or have since been changed, or else have become corrupted
from some source, wherefore we also, following the zeal of this admirable man," &c.

"Hippolytus, bishop of a certain church (I have not indeed been able to find out the name of
the city), wrote a reckoning of Easter, and chronological tables up to the first year of the Emperor
Alexander, and hit upon a cycle of sixteen years which the Greeks call ékkatēekaermpiða ; and gave

From the same book (chap. 81).

"Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea in Palestine, a man most studious in the sacred Scriptures,
and along with Pamphilus the martyr a most diligent investigator of sacred literature, has edited
an infinite number of volumes, some of which are these : of the Demonstratio Evange/ica, twenty
books; of the Praparatio Evangelica, fifteen books; of the Theophania, five books; of the
Acc/esiastical History, ten books; a General History in Chronosogica/ Zabses, and an Episome
of them; also, On the Discrepancies of the Gospels; On Isaiah, ten books; and Against Porphyry
(who at the same time was writing in Sicily, as some think), thirty books, of which only twenty
have come to my notice; of his 7opica, one book; of the Aposogia, in defense of Origen, six
books; On the Life of Pamphilus, three books; Concerning the Martyrs, other small works;
also very learned commentaries on the hundred and fifty Psalms, and many other writings. He
flourished chiefly under the emperors Constantine and Constantius; and on account of his friend

From the same book (chap. 96).

"Eusebius, by nation a Sardinian, and, after being reader in Rome, bishop of Vercellae, on ac

to Cappadocia, under Julian the emperor sent back to the Church, has published the Commen

Jerome in the Preface to his Commentaries on Daniel.

"Against the prophet Daniel Porphyry wrote a twelfth volume, denying that that book was

The same, in the fifth book of his Commentaries on Isaiah.

"Eusebius of Caesarea, while promising in his title an historical exposition, strays off in divers
notions: while reading his books I found much else than what he gave promise of in his title.
For wherever history has failed him, he has crossed over into allegory; and in such a manner
does he unite things that are distinct, that I wonder at his joining together by a new art of dis

"When I had searched through the History of Eusebius, to which Rufinus, after having him

not find any heresy which I had not read among these very ones, except that one which Eusebius
inserts in his sixth book, stating that it had existed in Arabia.

Antipater, Bishop of Bostra, in his First Book against Eusebius of Caesarea's Apology for Origen.

"Since now this man was very learned, having searched out and traced back all the books
and writings of the more ancient writers, and having set forth the opinions of almost all of them, .
and having left behind very many writings, some of which are worthy of all acceptation, making
use of such an estimation as this of the man, they attempt to lead away some, saying, that Euse
bius would not have chosen to take this view, unless he had accurately ascertained that all the
opinions of the ancients required it.
I, indeed, agree and admit that the man was very learned;
and that not anything of the more ancient writings escaped his knowledge; for, taking advantage
of the imperial co-operation, he was enabled easily to collect for his use material from whatever
quarter."

From the First Book of Extracts from the Ecclesiastica/ History of Philos/orgius.

"Philostorgius, while praising Eusebius Pamphili both as to whatever of worth belongs to his
histories and as to other things, yet declares that with regard to religion he has fallen into great
error; and that he impiously sets forth this error of his in detail, holding that the Deity is
unknowable and incomprehensible.
Moreover, he holds that he has also gone astray on other
such things.
But he unites with others in attesting that he brought his History down to the acces
sion of the sons of Constantine the Great."

Socrates in the First Book of his Ecclesiassica/ //issory (chap. 1).

"Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus (i.e. universally beloved), has composed a History of the
Church in ten books, brought down to the time of the Emperor Constantine, when the persecu
tion ceased which Diocletian had commenced against the Christians.
But, in writing the life of
Constantine, this author has very slightly treated of the Arian controversy, being evidently more
intent on a highly wrought eulogium of the emperor than an accurate statement of facts."

PRO LEGOMENA.

The same Socrates in the Eighth Chapter of the same Book, speaking of Sabinus, Bishop of
AMacedonia, who had written a History of the Synod, says : -

"Yet he commends Eusebius Pamphilus as a witness worthy of credit, and praises the Emperor
as capable in stating Christian doctrines; but he still brands the faith which was declared at Nice
as having been set forth by ignorant men, and such as had no intelligence in the matter. Thus
he voluntarily contemns the testimony of a man whom he himself pronounces a wise and true wit
ness; for Eusebius declares that of the ministers of God who were present at the Nicene Synod,
some were eminent for the word of wisdom, others for the strictness of their life; and that the
Emperor himself being present, leading all into unanimity, established unity of judgment, and
conformity of opinion among them."

The same Socrates, in Book II. chap. 21.

"But since some have attempted to stigmatize Eusebius Pamphilus as having favored the Arian
views in his works, it may not be irrelevant here to make a few remarks respecting him.
In the
first place, then, he was present at the council of Nice, and gave his assent to what was there
determined in reference to the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and in the third book
of the Zife of Constantine, he thus expressed himself: "The Emperor incited all to unanimity, until
he had rendered them united in judgment on those points on which they were previously at variance:
so that they were quite agreed as A'ice in matters of faith.'
Since, therefore, Eusebius, in men
tioning the Nicene Synod, says that all differences were composed, and that unanimity of senti
ment prevailed, what ground is there for assuming that he was himself an Arian P. The Arians are

say that in his discourses he seems to have adopted the opinions of Arius, because of his fre

one of the others, observe what Eusebius says on this subject in his first book against Marcellus:
"‘Ase alone, and no other, has been declared to be, and is the on/y-begotten Son of God'; whence
any one would justly censure those who have presumed to affirm that he is a Creature made of
nothing, like the rest of the creatures; for how then would he be a Son 2 and how could he be
God's only-begotten, were he assigned the same nature as the other creasures, and were he one
of the many created things, seeing that he, like them, would in that case be partaker of a creation
from nothing 2
The sacred Scriptures do not thus instruct us concerning these things.' He again
adds a little afterwards: "I Whoever then determines that the Son is made of things that are not,
and that he is a creature produced from moshing pre-existing, forgess that while he concedes the
name of Son, he denies him to be so in reality.
For he that is made of nothing cannot truly be the
Son of God, any more than the other things which have been made: but the true Son of God, for
asmuch as he is begotten of the Father, is properly denominated the only-begotten and beloved of
'the Father.
For this reason asso, he himself is God'; for what can the offspring of God be but
the perfect resemblance of him who begaf him 2 A sovereign, indeed, builds a city, but does not

"These and many other such expressions are found in the first book of Eusebius Pamphilus
against Marcellus; and in his third book, declaring in what sense the term creature is to be taken,
he says: "According/y these things being established, if so/ows that in the same sense as that which

"These quotations from the books of Eusebius against Marcellus have been adduced to con
fute those who have slanderously attempted to traduce and criminate him.
Neither can they prove
that Eusebius attributes a beginning of subsistence to the Son of God, although they may find
him often using the expressions of dispensation: and especially so, because he was an emulator
and admirer of the works of Origen, in which those who are able to comprehend that author's
writings, will perceive it to be everywhere stated that the Son was begotten of the Father. These
remarks have been made in passing, in order to refute those who have misrepresented Eusebius."

Sozomen in the First Book of his Ecclesiastical History (chap. 1.).

"I at first felt strongly inclined to trace the course of events from the very commencement;
but on reflecting that similar records of the past, up to their own time, had been compiled by the
learned Clemens and Hegesippus, successors of the apostles, by Africanus the historian and Euse
bius surnamed Pamphilus, a man intimately acquainted with the sacred Scriptures and the writ

Wherefore thou art worthy of being compared in zeal with Eusebius of Caesarea, and art worthy
of being remembered perpetually with an equal share of glory."

From an old Manuscript Breziary of the Lemowicensian Church.

"Of the holy Eusebius, bishop and confessor.
"Lesson 1.

Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea in Palestine, on account of his friendship with
Pamphilus the martyr, took from him the surname of Pamphili; inasmuch as along with this same
Pamphilus he was a most diligent investigator of sacred literature. The man indeed is very
worthy of being remembered in these times, both for his skill in many things, and for his won
derful genius, and by both Gentiles and Christians he was held distinguished and most noble
among philosophers.
This man, after having for a time labored in behalf of the Arian heresy,
coming to the council of Nicaea, inspired by the Holy Spirit, followed the decision of the
Fathers, and thereafter up to the time of his death lived in a most holy manner in the orthodox
faith.

"Lesson 2. He was, moreover, very zealous in the study of the sacred Scriptures, and along
with Pamphilus the martyr was a most diligent investigator of sacred literature.
At the same
time he has written many things, but especially the following books: The Praeparatio Evange/ica,
the Ecclesiastical History, Against Porphyry, a very bitter enemy of the Christians; he has also
composed Six Apologies in Behalf of Origen, a Life of Pamphilus the Martyr, from whom on
account of friendship he took his surname, in three books; likewise very learned Commentaries
on the hundred and fifty Psalms.

"Lesson 3.

Moreover, as we read, after having ascertained the sufferings of many holy
martyrs in all the provinces, and the lives of confessors and virgins, he has written concerning these
saints twenty books; while on account of these books therefore, and especially on account of his
Praparatio Aevangelica, he was held most distinguished among the Gentiles, because of his
love of truth he contemned the ancestral worship of the gods. He has written also a Chronicle,
extending from the first year of Abraham up to the year 3oo A.D., which the divine Hieronymus

From the book On the Zights of the Church.

"Eusebius of Caesarea, the key of the Scriptures and custodian of the New Testament, is
proved by the Greeks to be greater than many in his treatises.
There are three celebrated works
of his which truly testify to this: the Canons of the Four Gospe/s, which set forth and defend the
New Testament, ten books of Ecclesiastica/Asistory, and the Chronicom, that is, a chronological
summary. We have never found any one who has been able to follow in all his foot-prints."

TESTIMONIES AGAINST EUSEBIUS.

TESTIMONIES OF THE ANCIENTS AGAINST EUSEBIUS.

From the Epistle of Arius to Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia (in Theodoret's Eccles. Hist. I. 5)."
"Eusebius, your brother bishop of Caesarea, Theodotius, Paulinus, Athanasius, Gregory, AEtius,
and all the bishops of the East, have been condemned because they say that God had an exist
ence prior to that of his Son."

From the Book of Marcellus of Ancyra against the Arians.

"Having happened upon a letter of Narcissus, bishop of Neronias, which he wrote to one
Chrestus and to Euphronius and to Eusebius, in which it seems that Hosius, the bishop, had
asked him whether or not like Eusebius of Palestine he believed in the existence of two essences,
I read in the writing that he answered that he believed in the existence of three essences."

From the Synodical Epistle of the Bishops of Egypt, met in the City of Alexandria, to All the
Bishops of the Catholic Church (which Athanasius gives in his second apology against the
Arians).
"For what sort of a council of bishops was that? What sort of an assembly having truth for

as against those who held the opinions of Arius? Was not Eusebius of Caesarea in Palestine
accused by our confessors of sacrificing?"

Epiphanius in the Heresy of the Mesetians (Haer. LXVIII.).

"The emperor upon hearing these things becomes very angry and orders that a synod be con
voked in Phoenicia in the city of Tyre; he also gave orders that Eusebius and some others should
act as judges: these persons moreover had leaned somewhat too far toward the vulgarity of
the Arians. There were also summoned the bishops of the Catholic Church in Egypt, also certain
men subject to Athanasius, who were likewise great and who kept their lives transparent before God,
among whom was the great Potamo of blessed memory, bishop and confessor of Heraclea.

person of no man,-for he had been deprived of an eye in the persecution for the truth, - seeing
Eusebius sitting down and acting as judge, and Athanasius standing up, overcome by grief and
weeping, as is the wont with true men, he addressed Eusebius in a loud voice, saying, "Dost thou
sit down, Eusebius, and is Athanasius, an innocent man, judged by thee? Who could bear such
things? Do thou tell me, wert thou not in confinement with me at the time of the persecution?
I have parted with an eye for the sake of the truth, but thou neither seemest to be maimed at
all in body, nor hast thou suffered martyrdom, but art alive, and in no part mutilated. How
didst thou escape from the confinement unless that thou didst promise those who have inflicted
upon us the violence of persecution to perform the ungodly act, or didst actually perform it?'"

From the Epistle of the Catholic Bishops of Egypt to the Synod of Tyre (which Athanasius gives in
the above-mentioned Apology).

"For ye also know, as we have said before, that they are our enemies, and ye know why

Eusebius of Caesarea has become our enemy since last year."

Athanasius in his Epistle on the Decrees of the Council of Micaea.

"The strange thing is that Eusebius of Caesarea in Palestine, who had denied on one day, but
on the next day had subscribed, sent to his church, saying that this is the faith of the Church,

and that this is the tradition of the Fathers. He plainly showed to all that before they had been
in error, and had been vainly striving after the truth; for although he was then ashamed to write
in just these terms, and excused himself to the Church as he himself wished, yet he plainly wishes
to imply this in his Epistle, by his not denying the "Homočusion,' ‘one in substance,' and ‘of
the substance.' He got into serious difficulty, for in defending himself, he went on to accuse the
Arians, because, having written that "the Son did not exist before that he was begotten,' they
thereby denied that he existed before his birth in the flesh."

The same, in his 77-eatise on the Synod's of Ariminum and Seleucia.

"Most of all, what would Acacius say to Eusebius his own teacher? who not only signed in
the synod at Nicaea, but also made it known by letter to the people under him that that was the
true faith, which had been agreed upon at the council of Nicaea ; for although he defended him
self as he pleased through the letter, yet he did not deny the grounds taken.
But he also accused
the Arians, since, in saying that "the Son did not exist before that he was begotten,' they also
deny that he existed before Mary."

The same, in his Epistle so the Bishops of Africa.

"This also was known all the while to Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, who, at first identifying
himself with the Arian heresy, and having afterwards signed at the self-same synod of Nicaea,
wrote to his own particular friends, firmly maintaining that, "We have known of certain learned
and renowned bishops and writers among the ancients who have used the term āpool'ortos in refer
ence to the divinity of the Father and Son.'"

-

The same, in his 77 easise on the Synod's of Ariminum and Seleucia.

which you lay against me in my praises [of him]; he says: ‘How did Methodius dare to write
against Origen after having said this and that concerning his opinions?' This is no place to speak
in behalf of a martyr, for not all things ought to be discussed in all places. Now let it suffice to
have barely touched upon the matter, that this same thing was charged against a most renowned
and most eloquent martyr by an Arian, which you as a friend praise in me, and, being offended,
censure me for."

The same, in his Epistle so Minervius and A/exander.

bius of Caesarea were indeed very learned men, but went astray in the truth of their opinions."

Socrates, in the First Book of his socc/esiastica///issory (chap. 23).

"Eusebius Pamphilus says that immediately after the Synod Egypt became agitated by intes
tine divisions; but as he does not assign the reason for this, some have accused him of disingen
uousness, and have even attributed his failure to specify the causes of these dissensions to a
determination on his part not to give his sanction to the proceedings at Nice."

TESTIMONIES AGAINST EUSEBIUS.

Again, in the same chapter.

"Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, accuses Eusebius Pamphilus of perverting the Nicene Creed;
but Eusebius denies that he violates that exposition of the faith, and recriminates, saying that
Eustathius was a defender of the opinion of Sabellius.
In consequence of these misunderstand
ings, each of them wrote volumes as if contending against adversaries: and although it was
admitted on both sides that the Son of God has a distinct person and existence, and all acknowl
edged that there is one God in a Trinity of Persons; yet, from what cause I am unable to divine,
they could not agree among themselves, and therefore were never at peace."

Theodoritus, in his Interpretation of the Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews, speaking of the Arians,
writes as follows:

"If not even this is sufficient to persuade them, it at least behooves them to believe Eusebius

of Palestine, whom they call the chief advocate of their own doctrines."

Nicetas, in his Thesaurus of the Orthodox Faith, Book V. Chap. 7.

"Moreover, Theodore of Mopsuestia relates that there were only nine persons out of all
whom the decrees of the Synod did not please, and that their names are as follows: Theognis of
Nicaea, Eusebius of Nicomedia, Patrophilus of Scythopolis, Eusebius of Caesarea in Palestine,
Narcissus of Neronias in Cilicia, which is now called Irenopolis, Paulinus of Tyre, Menophantus
of Ephesus, Secundus of Ptolemais, which borders upon Egypt, and Theonas of Marmarica.""

Antipater, Bishop of Bostra, in his First Book against Eusebius' Apology for Origen.

"I deny that the man has yet arrived at an accurate knowledge of the doctrines; wherefore
he ought to be given place to so far as regards his great learning, but as regards his knowledge
of doctrine he ought not.
But, moreover, we know him to have been altogether lacking in such
accurate knowledge."

And a little farther on.

"So now, that we may not seem to be trampling upon the man,- concerning whom it is not
our purpose for the present to speak, - examining into the accuracy of his Apology, we may go on
to show that both were heretics, both he who composed the Apology, and he in whose behalf it
was composed."

And farther on.

"For as to your attempting to show that others as well as he [Origen] have spoken of the
subordination of the Son to the Father, we may not at first wonder at it, for such is your opinion
and that of your followers; wherefore we say nothing concerning this matter for the present,
since it was long ago submitted and condemned at the general Council."

From the Acts of the Seventh (Ecumenical Counci/.

"For who of the faithful ones in the Church, and who of those who have obtained a knowl
edge of true doctrine, does not know that Eusebius Pamphili has given himself over to false ways
of thinking, and has become of the same opinion and of the same mind with those who follow after
the opinions of Arius? In all his historical books he calls the Son and Word of God a creature, a
servant, and to be adored as second in rank.
But if any speaking in his defense say that he sub

confessed the truth unto salvation, he would have asked forgiveness for his writings, at the same
time correcting them.
But this he has by no means done, for he remained like AEthiops with his
skin unchanged. In interpreting the verse "I said to the Lord, Thou art my Lord,' he has strayed
far away from the true sense, for this is what he says: "By the laws of nature every son's father

must be his lord; wherefore God who begat him must be at the same time God, Lord, and Father
of the only-begotten Son of God.' So also in his epistle to the holy Alexander, the teacher of the
great Athanasius, which begins thus: "With what anxiety and with what care have I set about
writing this letter,' in most open blasphemy he speaks as follows concerning Arius and his fol
lowers: "Thy letter accuses them of saying that the Son was made out of nothing, like all men.
But they have produced their own epistle which they wrote to thee, in which they give an account
of their faith, and expressly confess that "the God of the law and of the prophets and of the New
Testament, before eternal ages begat an only-begotten Son, through whom also he made the ages
and the universe; and that he begat him not in appearance, but in truth, and subjected him to his
own will, unchangeable and immutable, a perfect creature of God, but not as one of the creatures."
If, therefore, the letter received from them tells the truth, they wholly contradict thee, in that they
confess that the Son of God who existed before eternal ages, and through whom he made the

Him and after Him. But if He who is is not the only one, but there was also a Son existing, how
did He who is beget him who was existing? For thus those existing would be two.' These things
then Eusebius wrote to the illustrious Alexander; but there are also other epistles of his directed
to the same holy man, in which are found various blasphemies in defense of the followers of Arius.
So also, in writing to the bishop Euphration, he blasphemes most openly; his letter begins thus:
"I return to my Lord all thanks'; and farther on : "For we do not say that the Son was with the
Father, but that the Father was before the Son.
But the Son of God himself, knowing well that
he was greater than all, and knowing that he was other than the Father, and less than and subject
to Him, very piously teaches this to us also when he says, "The Father who sent me is greater
than I." ' And farther on : "Since the Son also is himself God, but not true God.'
So then from
these writings of his he shows that he holds to the doctrines of Arius and his followers. And with
this rebellious heresy of theirs the inventors of that Arian madness hold to one nature in hypo
static union, and affirm that our Lord took upon himself a body without soul, in his scheme of
redemption, affirming that the divine nature supplied the purposes and movements of the soul:
that, as Gregory the Divine says, they may ascribe suffering to the Deity; and it is evident that
those who ascribe suffering to the Deity are Patripassians. Those who share in this heresy do not
allow images, as the impious Severus did not, and Peter Cnapheus, and Philoxenus of Hierapolis,
and all their followers, the many-headed yet headless hydra.
So then Eusebius, who belongs to
this faction, as has been shown from his epistles and historical writings, as a Patripassian rejected
the image of Christ," etc.'

Photius, in his 144th Epistle to Constantine.

"That Eusebius (whether slave or friend of Pamphilus I know not) was carried off by Arian
ism, his books loudly proclaim. And he, feeling repentance as he pretends, and against his will,
confesses to his infirmity; although by his repentance he rather shows that he has not repented.
For he cannot show, by means of those writings in which he would seem to be defending himself,
that he has withdrawn from his former heretical doctrines, nor can he show that he agreed with the
holy and CEcumenical Synod.
But he speaks of it as a marvel that the upholders of the Homo
ousion should concur with him in sentiment and agree with him in opinion: and this fact both

end of his life he did not cease following them, many know, and it is easy to gather it from many

his books, thou shalt see that he was none the less truly overcome by that deadly disease than he
was by the Arian madness."

martyr Pamphilus, for which cause some say that he took from him the surname Pamphili."

Photius, in the Same Work (chap. 127).

"There has been read the work of Eusebius Pamphili In praise of the great emperor Con
stantine, consisting of four books.
In this is contained the whole life of the man, starting with
his very boyhood, also whatever deeds of his belong to ecclesiastical history, until he departed
from life at the age of sixty-four.

beauty of expression there is little, as indeed is the case in his other works. He inserts, more
over, in this work of his in four books very many passages from the whole decalogue of his
Ecclesiastical History. He says that Constantine the Great himself also was baptized in Nicome
dia, he having put off his baptism until then, because he desired to be baptized in the Jordan.
However, as to the heresy of Arius, he does not defi

nitely state whether he holds that opinion, or whether he has changed; or even whether Arius
held correct or incorrect views, although he ought to have made mention of these things, because
the synod occupied an important place among the deeds of Constantine the Great, and it again
demands a detailed account of them.
But he does state that a ‘controversy" arose between Arius
and Alexander (this is the name he cunningly gives to the heresy), and that the God-fearing
prince was very much grieved at this controversy, and strove by epistles and through Hosius, who
was then bishop of Cordova, to bring back the dissenting parties into peace and concord, they hav

vote cast against Arius in the Synod, and the just retribution of those who were his companions
in impiety and who were cast out together with him.
Finally, he does not even mention the terri
ble fate which was inflicted by God upon Arius in the sight of all. None of these things he brings
to the light, nor has he drawn up an account of the Synod and the things that were done in it.
Whence, also, when about to write a narrative concerning the divine Eustathius, he does not even
mention his name, nor what things were threatened and executed against him ; but referring
these things also to sedition and tumult, he again speaks of the calmness of the bishops, who
having been convened in Antioch by the zeal and coöperation of the Emperor, changed the sedi
tion and tumult into peace.
Likewise as to what things were maliciously contrived against the
ever-conquering Athanasius, when he set about making his history cover these things, he says that
Alexandria again was filled with sedition and tumult, and that this was calmed by the coming of
the bishops, who had the imperial aid.
But he by no means makes it clear who was the leader
of the sedition, what sort of sedition it was, or by what means the strife was settled. He also
keeps up almost the same mode of dissimulating in his account of the contentions existing among
bishops with respect to doctrines, and their disagreements on other matters."

Joannes Zonaras, in his Third Volume, in which he relates the Deeds of Constantine.

"Even Eusebius Pamphili, bishop of Caesarea in Palestine, was at that time one of those
who upheld the doctrines of Arius. He is said to have afterwards withdrawn from the opinion
of Arius, and to have become of like mind with those who hold that the Son is coèqual and of
the same nature with the Father, and to have been received into communion by the holy Fathers.
Moreover, in the Acts of the first Synod, he is found to have defended the faithful.
These things
are found thus narrated by some ; but he makes them to appear doubtful by certain things which
he is seen to have written in his Ecclesiastical History.
For in many places in the above

lished,' he says that the Father and Maker is to be considered as maker and universal ruler,
governing by a kingly nod, and that the second after him in authority, the divine Word, is sub
ject to the commands of the Father. And farther on he says, that he, as being the power and
wisdom of the Father, is entrusted with the second place in the kingdom and rule over all.
And again, a little farther on, that there is also a certain essence, living and subsisting before the
world, which ministers to the God and Father of the universe for the creation of things that
are created.
Also Solomon, in the person of the wisdom of God, says, "The Lord created me
in the beginning of his ways,' etc., and farther on he says: And besides all this, as the pre
existent word of God, who also preexisted before all ages created, he received divine honor from
the Father, and is worshipped as God. These and other things show that Eusebius agreed with
Arian doctrines, unless some one say that they were written before his conversion."

zealous in the study of the holy Scriptures, and along with Pamphilus the martyr a most careful
investigator of sacred literature, has published many books, among which are the following.""

'. The remainder of this extract from Sophronius is a translation | adds some extracts from Baronius and Scaliger; but inasmuch as
they are to be classed with modern rather than with ancient writers,
it has seemed best to omit the quotations from their works.

of the chapter of Jerome's de viris illustribus, which is quoted
Walesius
above, on p. 60, and is therefore omitted at this point.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS,

BOO

K I.

CHAPTER I.

The Pan of the Work.

It is my purpose to write an account of
the successions of the holy apostles, as well
as of the times which have elapsed from the days
of our Saviour to our own; and to relate the
many important events which are said to have
occurred in the history of the Church ; and to
mention those who have governed and presided
over the Church in the most prominent parishes,
and those who in each generation have pro
claimed the divine word either orally or in
It is my purpose also to give the names
writing.
and number and times of those who through
love of innovation have run into the greatest
errors, and, proclaiming themselves discov
erers of knowledge falsely so-called," have like
fierce wolves unmercifully devastated the flock
of Christ.
It is my intention, moreover, to re
count the misfortunes which immediately came
upon the whole Jewish nation in conse
quence of their plots against our Saviour,
and to record the ways and the times in
which the divine word has been attacked by the
Gentiles, and to describe the character of those
who at various periods have contended for it in
the face of blood and of tortures, as well as the
confessions which have been made in our own
days, and finally the gracious and kindly succor
which our Saviour has afforded them all.
Since
I propose to write of all these things I shall
commence my work with the beginning of the
dispensation * of our Saviour and Lord Jesus
Christ."

But at the outset I must crave for my
work the indulgence of the wise," for I con
fess that it is beyond my power to produce a
perfect and complete history, and since I am
the first to enter upon the subject, I am attempt
ing to traverse as it were a lonely and untrodden
path."
I pray that I may have God as my guide
and the power of the Lord as my aid, since I
am unable to find even the bare footsteps of
those who have traveled the way before me,
except in brief fragments, in which some in one
way, others in another, have transmitted to us
particular accounts of the times in which they
lived.
From afar they raise their voices like
torches, and they cry out, as from some lofty
and conspicuous watch-tower, admonishing us
where to walk and how to direct the course of
our work steadily and safely.
Having gath
ered therefore from the matters mentioned
here and there by them whatever we con
sider important for the present work, and having
plucked like flowers from a meadow the appro
priate passages from ancient writers," we shall
endeavor to embody the whole in an historical
narrative, content if we preserve the memory of

Heinichen, however,
followed by Burton, Schwegler, Closs, and Stigloher, read evyww
wóvov, which I have also accepted. Closs translates die Machsicht
der Kenner, Stigloher, wohlwollende Machsicht.
Cruse avoids
the difficulty by omitting the word; an omission which is quite
...}.

5 Eusebius is rightly called the "Father of Church History."
He had no predecessors who wrote, as he did, with a comprehen
sive #...,'. in view; and yet, as he tells us, much had been
written of which he made good use in his History. The one who
approached nearest to the idea of a Church historian was Hegesippus
(see Bk. IV. chap. 22, note 1), but his writings were little more than
fragmentary memoirs, or collections of disconnected reminiscences:
For instance, Eusebius, in Bk. II. chap 23, quotes from his fifth and
last book the account of the martyrdom of James the Just, which
shows that his work lacked at least all chronological arrangement.
{...". Africanus (see Bk. VI. chap. 31, note 1) also furnished Euse
ius with much material in the line of chronology, and in his Chron
icle Eusebius made free use of him. These are the only two who
can in any sense be said to have preceded Eusebius in his province,
and neither one can rob him of his right to be called the "Father of
Church History."

• One of the greatest values of Eusebius. History lies in the quo
tations which it contains from earlier ecclesiastical writers. The
works of many of them are lost, and are known to us only.
This fact alone is enough to make
the extracts made by Eusebius.
his History of inestimable worth.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EU SEBIUS.

[I. I.

the successions of the apostles of our Saviour;
if not indeed of all, yet of the most renowned
of them in those churches which are the most
noted, and which even to the present time are

held in honor.

This work seems to me of especial im
portance because I know of no ecclesiastical
writer who has devoted himself to this subject;
and I hope that it will appear most useful to
those who are fond of historical research.
I have already given an epitome of these
things in the Chronological Canons' which
I have composed, but notwithstanding that, I
have undertaken in the present work to write as
full an account of them as I am able. My
work will begin, as I have said, with the
dispensation" of the Saviour Christ, - which
is loftier and greater than human conception,
-and with a discussion of his divinity";
for it is necessary, inasmuch as we derive
even our name from Christ, for one who
proposes to write a history of the Church to be
gin with the very origin of Christ's dispensation,
a dispensation more divine than many think.

CHAPTER II.

Summary View of the Pre-existence and Divin
ity of Our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ.

SINCE in Christ there is a twofold nature,
and the one - in so far as he is thought of
as God - resembles the head of the body, while
the other may be compared with the feet, - in
so far as he, for the sake of our salvation, put on
human nature with the same passions as our own,
-the following work will be complete only if
we begin with the chief and lordliest events of
all his history.
In this way will the antiquity
and divinity of Christianity be shown to those
who suppose it of recent and foreign origin,'
and imagine that it appeared only yester
day." No language is sufficient to express

in connection with otolo; which is then quite commonly used to
denote the "human nature" of Christ.

. *This was one of the principal objections raised against Chris
tianity. , Antiquity was considered a prime requisite in a religion
which claimed to be true, and no reproach was greater than the
reproach of novelty. , Hence the apologists laid great stress u
the antiquity of Christianity, and this was one reason why they
appropriated the Old Testament as a Christian book. Compare,
for instance, the apologies of Justin Martyr, Tatian, Athenagoras,
Theophilus, Tertullian and Minucius Felix, and the works of

ets, he describes under the influence of the
divine Spirit the creation and arrangement of the
universe.
He declares that the maker of the
world and the creator of all things yielded to
Christ himself, and to none other than his own
clearly divine and first-born Word, the making of
inferior things, and communed with him respect
ing the creation of man.
"For," says he, "God
said, Let us make man in our image and in
our likeness." And another of the prophets
confirms this, speaking of God in his hymns
as follows: "He spake and they were made ; he
commanded and they were created."" He here
introduces the Father and Maker as Ruler of
all, commanding with a kingly nod, and second
to him the divine Word, none other than the
one who is proclaimed by us, as carrying out

There is really nothing in this passage to imply
that the Psalmist thinks, as Eusebius supposes, of the Son as the
Father's agent in creation, who is here addressed by the Father.
As Stroth remarks, "According to Eusebius, "He spake is equiva
lent to "He said to the Son, Create '; and "They were created"
means, according to him, not ' They arose immediately upon this
command of God,' but ‘The Son was immediately obedient to the
command of the Father and produced them."
For Eusebius con
nects this verse with the sixth, "By the word of the Lord were the
heavens made,' where he understands Christ to be referred to.
Perhaps this verse has been omitted in the Greek through an over
sight, for it is found in Rufinus."

PRE-EXISTENCE AND DIVINITY OF CHRIST.

the Father's commands.
All that are said
to have excelled in righteousness and piety
since the creation of man, the great servant Mo
ses and before him in the first place Abraham
and his children, and as many righteous men and
prophets as afterward appeared, have contem
plated him with the pure eyes of the mind, and
have recognized him and offered to him the
worship which is due him as Son of God.
But he, by no means neglectful of the rev
erence due to the Father, was appointed to
teach the knowledge of the Father to them all.
For instance, the Lord God, it is said, appeared
as a common man to Abraham while he was sit
ting at the oak of Mambre." And he, immediately
falling down, although he saw a man with his
eyes, nevertheless worshiped him as God, and
sacrificed to him as Lord, and confessed that he
was not ignorant of his identity when he uttered
the words, "Lord, the judge of all the earth, wilt
thou not execute righteous judgment?""
For if it is unreasonable to suppose that the
unbegotten and immutable essence of the
almighty God was changed into the form of man,
or that it deceived the eyes of the beholders
with the appearance of some created thing, and
if it is unreasonable to suppose, on the other
hand, that the Scripture should falsely invent such
things, when the God and Lord who judgeth all
the earth and executeth judgment is seen in the
form of a man, who else can be called, if it be
not lawful to call him the first cause of all things,
than his only pre-existent Word?" Concern
ing whom it is said in the Psalms, "He sent his
Word and healed them, and delivered them
from their destructions."."
Moses most
clearly proclaims him second Lord after the
Father, when he says, "The Lord rained upon
Sodom and Gomorrah brinstone and fire from
the Lord." The divine Scripture also calls him
God, when he appeared again to Jacob in the
form of a man, and said to Jacob, "Thy name
shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel shall
be thy name, because thou hast prevailed with
God." Wherefore also Jacob called the name
of that place "Vision of God," saying, "For I
have seen God face to face, and my life is
preserved."" Nor is it admissible to sup
pose that the theophanies recorded were

!" Gen. xviii. 25.

* See Gen. xviii. 1 sq.
* Eusebius accepts the common view of the early Church, that
the theophanies of the Old Testament were Christophanies; that is,
appearances of the second person of the Trinity.
Augustine seems
to have been the first of the Fathers to take a different view, main
taining that such Christophanies were not consistent with the iden
tity of essence between Father and Son, and that the Scriptures
themselves teach that it was not the Logos, but an angel, that ap
poored to the Old Testament worthies on various occasions (cf. Z),
Trio. III. 11).
Augustine's opinion was widely adopted, but in
roodern times the earlier view, which Eusebius represents, has been
the prevailing one (see Hodge, Systematic 7% cology, I. p. 490, and
Lange's article Theophany in Herzog).

Scripture does not conceal the

fact, but calls them by name not God nor Lord,
but angels, as it is easy to prove by num

But why the Gospel was not preached
in ancient times to all men and to all
nations, as it is now, will appear from the follow
ing considerations." The life of the ancients
was not of such a kind as to permit them to
receive the all-wise and all-virtuous teaching
of Christ.
For immediately in the begin
ning, after his original life of blessedness,
the first man despised the command of God,
and fell into this mortal and perishable state,
and exchanged his former divinely inspired
luxury for this curse-laden earth.
His descend
ants having filled our earth, showed themselves
much worse, with the exception of one here and
there, and entered upon a certain brutal and
insupportable mode of life. They thought
neither of city nor state, neither of arts nor
sciences. They were ignorant even of the
name of laws and of justice, of virtue and of
philosophy. As nomads, they passed their lives
in deserts, like wild and fierce beasts, destroy
ing, by an excess of voluntary wickedness, the
natural reason of man, and the seeds of thought
and of culture implanted in the human soul.
They gave themselves wholly over to all kinds
of profanity, now seducing one another, now
slaying one another, now eating human flesh,
and now daring to wage war with the Gods and
to undertake those battles of the giants cele
brated by all; now planning to fortify earth
against heaven, and in the madness of un

£oans; Proem. Bk. VIII.; and compare also Gregory of Nyssa's
Third Oration on the birth of the Lord (at the beginning). The
objection which Eusebius undertakes to answer here was an old
one, and had been considered by Justin Martyr, by Origen in his
work against Celsus, and by others (see *::::::... Geschichte
der .4/ołogetik, p. 25 fs.).

governed pride to prepare an attack upon the
very God of all."

On account of these things, when they
conducted themselves thus, the all-seeing
God sent down upon them floods and conflagra
tions as upon a wild forest spread over the
whole earth. He cut them down with contin
uous famines and plagues, with wars, and with
thunderbolts from heaven, as if to check some
terrible and obstinate disease of souls with
more severe punishments. Then, when the
excess of wickedness had overwhelmed
nearly all the race, like a deep fit of drunkenness,
beclouding and darkening the minds of men,
the first-born and first-created wisdom of God,
the pre-existent Word himself, induced by his
exceeding love for man, appeared to his ser
vants, now in the form of angels, and again to
one and another of those ancients who enjoyed
the favor of God, in his own person as the sav
ing power of God, not otherwise, however, than
in the shape of man, because it was im
possible to appear in any other way. And
as by them the seeds of piety were sown
among a multitude of men and the whole nation,
descended from the Hebrews, devoted them
selves persistently to the worship of God, he
imparted to them through the prophet Moses,
as to multitudes still corrupted by their ancient
practices, images and symbols of a certain mys
tic Sabbath and of circumcision, and elements
of other spiritual principles, but he did not
grant them a complete knowledge of the
mysteries themselves.
But when their law
became celebrated, and, like a sweet odor,
was diffused among all men, as a result of their
influence the dispositions of the majority of the
heathen were softened by the lawgivers and phi
losophers who arose on every side, and their
wild and savage brutality was changed into mild
ness, so that they enjoyed deep peace, friend
ship, and social intercourse."
Then, finally, at
the time of the origin of the Roman Empire, there
appeared again to all men and nations through
out the world, who had been, as it were, pre
viously assisted, and were now fitted to receive
the knowledge of the Father, that same teacher

27 The reference here seems to be to the building of the tower
of Babel (Gen. xi. 1-9), although Walesius thinks otherwise. The
fact that Eusebius o, to the battles of the giants, which were
celebrated in heathen song, does not militate against a reference in
this passage to the narrative recounted in Genesis. He illustrates
the presumption of the human race by instances familiar to his
readers whether drawn from Christian or from Pagan sources.
Compare the Praef. Evang. ix. 14.

* It was the opinion of Eusebius, in common with most of the
Fathers, that the Greek philosophers, lawgivers, and
ts had ob
tained their wisdom from the ancient Hebrews, and this point was
pressed very strongly by many of the apologists in their effort to
prove the antiquity of Christianity. The assertion was made espe
cially in the case of Plato and Pythagoras, who were said to have
become acquainted with the books of the Hebrews upono
to Egypt. Compare among other passages Justin's A/o/, I. 59 ft.;

of virtue, the minister of the Father in all good
things, the divine and heavenly Word of God, in a
human body not at all differing in substance from
our own. He did and suffered the things which
had been prophesied.
For it had been foretold
that one who was at the same time man and God
should come and dwell in the world, should per
form wonderful works, and should show himself a

death, his resurrection from the dead, and,
finally, his divine ascension into heaven.
For instance, Daniel the prophet, under the
influence of the divine Spirit, seeing his
kingdom at the end of time," was inspired thus
to describe the divine vision in language fitted
to human comprehension : "For I beheld," he
says, "until thrones were placed, and the Ancient
of Days did sit, whose garment was white as
snow and the hair of his head like pure wool;
his throne was a flame of fire and his wheels
burning fire. A river of fire flowed before him.

given him the dominion and the glory and the

minion which shall not pass away, and his
kingdom shall not be destroyed."*
It is
clear that these words can refer to no one
else than to our Saviour, the God Word who
was in the beginning with God, and who was
called the Son of man because of his final
appearance in the flesh.
But since we have
collected in separate books" the selections
from the prophets which relate to our Saviour
Jesus Christ, and have arranged in a more logi
cal form those things which have been revealed
concerning him, what has been said will suffice for
the present.

to make known the name of Christ as a
name especially august and glorious. When he
delivered types and symbols of heavenly things,
and mysterious images, in accordance with the
oracle which said to him, "Look that thou make
all things according to the pattern which was
shown thee in the mount," he consecrated a
man high priest of God, in so far as that was
possible, and him he called Christ." And thus
to this dignity of the high priesthood, which in
his opinion surpassed the most honorable posi
tion among men, he attached for the sake of
honor and glory the name of Christ. He
knew so well that in Christ was something
divine. And the same one foreseeing, under the
influence of the divine Spirit, the name Jesus, dig
nified it also with a certain distinguished privi
lege.
For the name of Jesus, which had never
been uttered among men before the time of
Moses, he applied first and only to the one who
he knew would receive after his death, again as
a type and symbol, the supreme command.
His successor, therefore, who had not hitherto borne the name Jesus, but had been
called by another name, Auses," which had been
given him by his parents, he now called Jesus,
bestowing the name upon him as a gift of honor,
far greater than any kingly diadem.
For Jesus
himself, the son of Nave," bore a resemblance
to our Saviour in the fact that he alone, after
Moses and after the completion of the symboli
cal worship which had been transmitted by him,
succeeded to the government of the true
and pure religion. Thus Moses bestowed
the name of our Saviour, Jesus
Christ,
as a mark of the highest honor, upon the two
men who in his time surpassed all the rest of
the people in virtue and glory; namely, upon
the high priest and upon his own successor
in the government. And the prophets that
came after also clearly foretold Christ by
name, predicting at the same time the plots
which the Jewish people would form against
him, and the calling of the nations through him.
Jeremiah, for instance, speaks as follows: "The

"God's salvation" (Num. xiii. 16). , Jerome, (de vio, isł. G. I.
speaks of this corruption as existing in Greek and Latin MSS. of the
Scriptures, and as having no sense, and contends that Osee is the
proper form, Osee meaning "Salvator." The same corruption
(Auses) occurs also in Tertullian, Adro...]/arc; iii. 16, and Adv.

ent passage, in both cases departs from the original, and renders

163), and in Lactantius, Anstitutes, iv. 17.

Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord, was taken
in their destructions; of whom we said, under his
shadow we shall live among the nations." And
David, in perplexity, says, "Why did the nations
rage and the people imagine vain things? The
kings of the earth set themselves in array, and
the rulers were gathered together against the
Lord and against his Christ";" to which he adds,
in the person of Christ himself, "The Lord said
unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I be
gotten thee.
Ask of me, and I will give thee the
nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost
parts of the earth for thy possession."'

And not only those who were honored with
the high priesthood, and who for the sake
of the symbol were anointed with especially
prepared oil, were adorned with the name of
Christ among the Hebrews, but also the kings
whom the prophets anointed under the influence
of the divine Spirit, and thus constituted, as it
were, typical Christs. For they also bore in their
own persons types of the royal and sovereign
power of the true and only Christ, the
divine Word who ruleth over all. And we
have been told also that certain of the
prophets themselves became, by the act of
anointing, Christs in type, so that all these have
reference to the true Christ, the divinely inspired
and heavenly Word, who is the only high priest
of all, and the only King of every creature, and
the Father's only...supreme prophet of proph
ets. And a proof of this is that no one of
those who were of old symbolically anointed,
whether priests, or kings, or prophets, possessed
so great a power of inspired virtue as was ex
hibited by our Saviour and Lord Jesus, the
true and only Christ. None of them at
least, however superior in dignity and honor
they may have been for many generations among
their own people, ever gave to their followers
the name of Christians from their own typical
name of Christ.
Neither was divine honor ever
rendered to any one of them by their subjects;
nor after their death was the disposition of their
followers such that they were ready to die for
the one whom they honored. And never did so
great a commotion arise among all the nations
of the earth in respect to any one of that age ;
for the mere symbol could not act with such
power among them as the truth itself which
was exhibited by our Saviour. He, although
he received no symbols and types of high
priesthood from any one, although he was not
born of a race of priests, although he was not
elevated
to a kingdom by military guards,
although he was not a prophet like those of old,
although he obtained no honor nor pre-eminence
among the Jews, nevertheless was adorned by
the Father with all, if not with the symbols,

* Sam. iv. 20.

* Ps. ii. 1, 2.

yet with the truth itself. And therefore,
although he did not possess like honors with
those whom we have mentioned, he is called
Christ more than all of them. And as himself
the true and only Christ of God, he has filled
the whole earth with the truly august and sacred
name of Christians, committing to his followers
no longer types and images, but the uncovered
virtues themselves, and a heavenly life in
the very doctrines of truth. And he was not
anointed with oil prepared from material
substances, but, as besits divinity, with the divine
Spirit himself, by participation in the unbegotten
deity of the Father. And this is taught also
again by Isaiah, who exclaims, as if in the person
of Christ himself, "The Spirit of the Lord is
upon me; therefore hath he anointed me. He
hath sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor,
to proclaim deliverance to captives, and re
covery of sight to the blind." And not only
Isaiah, but also David addresses him, say
ing, "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever.
A scepter of equity is the scepter of thy king
dom. Thou hast loved righteousness and hast
hated iniquity.
Therefore God, thy God, hath
anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows."
Here the Scripture calls him God in
the first verse, in the second it honors him
with a royal scepter. Then a little farther
on, after the divine and royal power, it rep
resents him in the third place as having become
Christ, being anointed not with oil made of
material substances, but with the divine oil of
gladness.
It thus indicates his especial honor,
far superior to and different from that of those
who, as types, were of old anointed in a
more material way.
And elsewhere the
same writer speaks of him as follows: "The
Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right
hand until
I make thine enemies thy foot
stool";" and, "Out of the womb, before the
morning star, have I begotten thee. The Lord
hath sworn and he will not repent. Thou art a
priest forever after the order of Melchize
dec."" But this Melchizedec is introduced
in the Holy Scriptures as a priest of the
most high God," not consecrated by any anoint
ing oil, especially prepared, and not even be
longing by descent to the priesthood of the
Jews.
Wherefore after his order, but not after
the order of the others, who received symbol;
and types, was our Saviour proclaimed, with
an appeal to an oath, Christ and priest.
History, therefore, does not relate that he
was anointed corporeally by the Jews, nor

that he belonged to the lineage of priests, but
that he came into existence from God himself
before the morning star, that is before the or
ganization of the world, and that he obtained
an immortal and undecaying priesthood for
eternal ages.
But it is a great and con
vincing proof of his incorporeal and divine
unction that he alone of all those who have ever
existed is even to the present day called Christ
by all men throughout the world, and is con
fessed and witnessed to under this name, and is
commemorated both by Greeks and Barbarians,
and even to this day is honored as a King by
his followers throughout the world, and is ad
mired as more than a prophet, and is glorified
as the true and only high priest of God." And
besides all this, as the pre-existent Word of God,
called into being before all ages, he has received
august honor from the Father, and is wor
shiped as God. But most wonderful of all
is the fact that we who have consecrated
ourselves to him, honor him not only with our
voices and with the sound of words, but also
with complete elevation of soul, so that we
choose to give testimony unto him rather than

to preserve our own lives.

I have of necessity prefaced my history
with these matters in order that no one,
judging from the date of his incarnation, may
think that our Saviour and Lord Jesus, the Christ,
has but recently come into being.

CHAPTER IV.

The Religion proclaimed by him to All AWations
was neither Mew nor Strange.

BUT that no one may suppose that his
doctrine is new and strange, as if it were
framed by a man of recent origin, differing in
no respect from other men, let us now briefly
consider this point also.
It is admitted that
when in recent times the appearance of our
Saviour Jesus Christ had become known to all
men there immediately made its appearance a
new nation; a nation confessedly not small, and
not dwelling in some corner of the earth, but
the most numerous and pious of all nations,' in
destructible and unconquerable, because it always
receives assistance from God.
This nation, thus
suddenly-appearing at the time appointed by
the inscrutable counsel of God, is the one which
has been honored by all with the name of
Christ. One of the prophets, when he saw
beforehand with the eye of the Divine Spirit

* Eusebius, in this chapter and in the Prm. Zozang. IV. 15, is

the first of the Fathers to mention the three offices of Christ.

"Cf. Tertullian, Aoos. XXXVII. (Ante-AWicene Fathers, Am.

Ed. Vol. III. p. 45).

that which was to be, was so astonished at it that
he cried out, "Who hath heard of such things,
Hath the earth
and who hath spoken thus?
brought forth in one day, and hath a nation been
born at once?" And the same prophet gives a
hint also of the name by which the nation was
to be called, when he says, "Those that serve me
shall be called by a new name, which shall
be blessed upon the earth." "
But although
it is clear that we are new and that this new
name of Christians has really but recently been
known among all nations, nevertheless our life
and our conduct, with our doctrines of religion,
have not been lately invented by us, but from
the first creation of man, so to speak, have been
established by the natural understanding of
divinely favored men of old.
That this is
so we shall show in the following way. That
the Hebrew nation is not new, but is uni
versally honored on account of its antiquity, is
known to all. The books and writings of this
people contain accounts of ancient men, rare
indeed and few in number, but nevertheless dis
tinguished for piety and righteousness and every
other virtue. Of these, some excellent men
lived before the flood, others of the sons and
descendants of Noah lived after it, among them

the name indicates, that the Christian man,
through the knowledge and the teaching of
Christ, is distinguished
for temperance and
righteousness, for patience in life and manly
virtue, and for a profession of piety toward the
one and only God over all-all that was zeal
ously practiced by them not less than by us.
They did not care about circumcision of
the body, neither do we. They did not
care about observing Sabbaths, nor do we. They

the very Christ of God; for it has already been
shown that he appeared unto Abraham, that he
imparted revelations to Isaac, that he talked with
Jacob, that he held converse with Moses and
with the prophets that came after.
Hence
you will find those divinely favored men
honored with the name of Christ, according to
the passage which says of them, "Touch not
my Christs, and do my prophets no harm."

ll men in the age of Abraham.

So that it is clearly necessary to consider
that religion, which has lately been preached
to all nations through the teaching of Christ, the
first and most ancient of all religions, and the
one discovered by those divinely favored
If it is said
that Abraham, a long time afterward, was
given the command of circumcision, we reply
that nevertheless before this it was declared that
he had received the testimony of righteousness
through faith; as the divine word says, "Abra
ham believed in God, and it was counted
unto him for righteousness."" And indeed
unto Abraham, who was thus before his
circumcision a justified man, there was given by
God, who revealed himself unto him (but this
was Christ himself, the word of God), a proph
ecy in regard to those who in coming ages
should be justified in the same way as he. The
prophecy was in the following words: "And in
thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed."
And again, "He shall become a nation great
and numerous ; and in him shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed.""
It is
permissible to understand this as fulfilled
in us.
For he, having renounced the supersti
tion of his fathers, and the former error of his
life, and having confessed the one God over all,
and having worshiped him with deeds of virtue,
and not with the service of the law which was
afterward given by Moses, was justified by faith
in Christ, the Word of God, who appeared unto
him. To him, then, who was a man of this
character, it was said that all the tribes and all
the nations of the earth should be blessed
in him.
But that very religion of Abraham
has reappeared at the present time, prac
ticed in deeds, more efficacious than words,
by Christians alone throughout the world.

that we who are of Christ practice one and

The statement of Luke presents a chronological difficulty which

He, as also Mommsen, has proved that Quirinius was
twice governor of Syria, the first time from B.c. 4 (autumn) to b.c. 1.

In the same connection he
gives an account of the uprising of the Galile
ans, which took place at that time, of which
also Luke, among our writers, has made men
tion in the Acts, in the following words: "After
this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days
of the taxing, and drew away a multitude"
after him: he also perished ; and all, even
as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.""
The above-mentioned author, in the eigh
teenth book of his Antiquities, in agreement
with these words, adds the following, which we
quote exactly: "Cyrenius, a member of the
senate, one who had held other offices and had
passed through them all to the consulship, a
man also of great dignity in other respects,
came to Syria with a small retinue, being sent
by Caesar to be a judge of the nation and
to make an assessment of their property."
And after a little" he says: "But Judas,"
a Gaulonite, from a city called Gamala, taking
with him Sadduchus," a Pharisee, urged the
people to revolt, both of them saying that the
downright
taxation meant nothing else than
slavery, and exhorting the nation to defend
their liberty." And in the second book of
his History of the Jewish War, he writes
as follows concerning the same man : "At this
time a certain Galilean, whose name was Judas,
persuaded his countrymen to revolt, declaring
that they were cowards if they submitted to
pay tribute to the Romans, and if they endured,

nothing worse.
It was natural to connect the two censuses men

closer attention to the facts would have shown him the discrepancy
in date, which he simply overlooked.

But in the present section Jose
phus gives the fullest and most accurate account of him. Gaulo
nitis lay east of the Jordan, opposite Galilee. Judas of Galilee was
o, his common designation, given to him either because his
revolt took rise in Galilee, or because Galilee was used as a general
term for the north country. He was evidently a man of position
and great personal influence, and drew vast numbers to his standard,
denouncing, in the name of religion, the payment of tribute to
Rome and all submission to a foreign yoke.
The revolt spread
very rapidly, and the whole country was thrown into excitement
and disorder; but the Romans proved too strong for him, and
he soon perished, and his followers were dispersed, though many
of them continued active until the final destruction of the city.

through their land (Num. xx. 20); were conquered by Saul and
David, but again regained their independence, until they were fin

But the tradi

was the son of another Antipater, or Antipas, an Idumean who had

Herod that he was descended from Jewish ancestors. The report
originated with Nicolai Damasceni, a writer of the time cf. the

evidently, in a desire to degrade Herod by representing lin, as de

Antipater, having been taken a prisoner while
a boy by Idumean robbers, lived with them, be
cause his father, being a poor man, was unable
to pay a ransom for him.
Growing up in their
practices he was afterward befriended by Hyrca
nus," the high priest of the Jews. A son of his
was that Herod who lived in the times of
our Saviour." When the Kingdom of the
Jews had devolved upon such a man the
expectation of the nations was, according to
prophecy, already at the door.
For with him
their princes and governors, who had ruled in
regular succession from the time of Moses,
came to an end.
Before their captivity and
their transportation to Babylon they were
ruled by Saul first and then by David, and be
fore the kings leaders governed them who were
called Judges, and who came after Moses
and his successor Jesus.
After their return
from Babylon they continued to have with
out interruption an aristocratic form of govern
ment, with an oligarchy.
For the priests had
the direction of affairs until Pompey, the Roman
general, took Jerusalem by force, and defiled
the holy places by entering the very innermost
sanctuary of the temple."
Aristobulus," who,
by the right of ancient succession, had been up
to that time both king and high priest, he sent
with his children in chains to Rome; and gave
to Hyrcanus, brother of Aristobulus, the high
priesthood, while the whole nation of the Jews

very soon afterward taken prisoner by the Parthi

* topoćovaos, "a temple-slave."
* Hyrcanus l I., eldest son of the Kingo of
the Maccabaean family, became high priest upon the death of his
father, in 78 p.c.; and upon the death of his mother, in 69 B.C., as
cended the throne. He gave up his kingdom afterward (66 B.C.) to
his younger brother, Aristobulus; but under the influence of Anti
o the Idumean endeavored to regain it, and after a long war with
his brother, was re-established in power by Pompey, in 63 p.c., but
merely as high priest and governor, not with the title of king. He
retained his position until 40 B.C., when he was driven *iy his
nephew Antigonus. He was murdered in 30 p.c., by command of
Herod the Great, who had married his grand-daughter Mariamne.
He was throughout a weak man, and while in power was completely
under the influence of his minister, Antipater.

" In 63 B.C., when Pompey's curiosity led him to penetrate into
the Holy of Holics. He was much impressed, however, by its sim
plicity, and went away without disturbing its treasures, wondering at
a religion which had no visible God.

* Aristobulus II., younger brother of Hyrcanus, a much abler
and more emergetic man, assumed the kingdom by an arrangement
with his brother in 66 B.C. (see note 9, above). in 63 p.c. he was
deposed, and carried to Rome by l'ompey. He died about 48 B.c.
Eusebius is hardly correct in saying that Aristobulus was king and
high priest by regular succession, as his elder brother Hyrcanus was
the true heir, and he had assumed the power only because of his
superior ability.

time.
For three years only, from 40 to 37 B.C., while Antigonus, son
of Aristobulus and nephew of Hyrcanus, was in ...j.
was independent of Rome, but was soon retaken by Herod the Great,
and remained from that time on in more or less complete subjection,
either as a dependent kingdom or as a province.

salem and established himself as king there, until conquered by

-

already said, was made King of the Jewish
nation by the Roman senate and by Augustus. Under him Christ appeared in bodily
shape, and the expected Salvation of the nations
and their calling followed in accordance with
prophecy." From this time the princes and
rulers of Judah, I mean of the Jewish nation,
came to an end, and as a natural consequence
the order of the high priesthood, which from
ancient times had proceeded regularly in closest
succession from generation to generation,
was immediately thrown into confusion." Of
these things Josephus is also a witness," who
shows that when Herod was made King by the
Romans he no longer appointed the high priests
from the ancient line, but gave the honor to
certain obscure persons. A course similar to
that of Herod in the appointment of the priests
was pursued by his son Archelaus," and after
him by the Romans, who took the govern
ment into their own hands."
The same
writer shows " that Herod was the first that
locked up the sacred garment of the high priest
under his own seal and refused to permit the
high priests to keep it for themselves.
The
same course was followed by Archelaus after
him, and after Archelaus by the Romans.

These things have been recorded by us
in order to show that another prophecy has
been fulfilled in the appearance of our Saviour
Jesus Christ.
For the Scripture, in the book of
Daniel," having expressly mentioned a certain
number of weeks until the coming of Christ, of
which we have treated in other books," most
clearly prophesies, that after the completion of
those weeks the unction among the Jews should
totally perish. And this, it has been clearly
shown, was fulfilled at the time of the birth of
This has been neces
our Saviour Jesus Christ.

Herod in 37 p.c. : Hyrcanus returned to Jerusalem in 36 b.c., but
was no longer high priest.

* Compare Isa. ix. 2; xlii. 6; xlix. 6, etc.
* Eusebius' statement is persectly correct. The high priestly
lineage had been kept with great scrupulousness until Hyrcanus II.,
the last of the regular succession.
(His grandson Aristobulus, how
ever, was high priest for a year under Herod, but was then slain by
him.)
Afterward the high priest was appointed and changed at
pleasure by the secular ruler.

Herod the Great first established the practice of removing a high
priest during his lifetime; and under him there were no less than six
different ones.

woman, and younger brother of Herod Antipas. Upon the death of
his father, B.C. 4, he succeeded to the government of Idumea, Sama
ria, and Judea, with the title of Ethnarch.

"After the death of Archelaus (A.D. 7), Judea was made a
Roman province, and ruled by procurators until Herod Agrippa I.
came into power in 37 a.p. (see below, Bk. II. chap. 4, note 3). The
changes in the lo priesthood during the most of this time were
very rapid, one after another being appointed and removed accord
ing to the fancy of the procurator, or of the governor of Syria, who
held the power of appointment most of the time. There were no
fewer than nineteen high priests between the death of Archelaus and
the fall of Jerusalem.

was mentioned by us just above, in his epistle to
Aristides," where he discusses the harmony of
the gospel genealogies.
After refuting the opin
ions of others as forced and deceptive, he gives
the account which he had received from tra
dition * in these words : "For whereas the
names of the generations were reckoned in
Israel either according to nature or according to
law, - according to nature by the succession of
legitimate offspring, and according to law when
ever another raised up a child to the name of a
brother dying childless;" for because a clear
hope of resurrection was not yet given they had

are given and discussed at length. *. epistle (as given by Mai) is
translated in the Ante-Vicense Fathers, Am. ed. Ví. p. 125 fs.

The attempt of Africanus is, so far as we know, the first critical
attempt to harmonize the two genealogies of Christ. The question
had been the subject merely .# guesses and suppositions until his
time. He approaches the matter in a free critical spirit (such as
seems always to have characterized him), and his investigations
therefore déserve attention. He holds that both genealogies are
those of Joseph, and this was the unanimous opinion of antiquity,
though, as he says, the discrepancies were reconciled in various

terpretation Rev. John, Lightfoot justly says, "There is neither
reason for it, nor, indeed, any foundation at all."

Upon the supposition that both genealogies relate, to Joseph the
best explanation is that Matthew's table represents the royal line of
legal successors to the throne of David, while Luke's gives the line
of actual descent. This view is ably advocated by Hervey in Smith's
Biose Dictionary (article Genealogy of Žesus). Another opinion
which has prevailed widely since the Reformation is that Luke gives
the genealogy of Mary. The view is defended very ingeniously by

upon Matthew and Luke and the various lives of Christ, especially
Andrews', p. 55 sq.

* Eusebius makes a mistake in saying that Africanus had re
ceived the explanation which follows from tradition.
For Africanus
himself says expressly (§ 15, below) that his interpretation is not
supported by testimony.
Eusebius' error has been repeated by most
writers upon the subject, but is crposed by Spitta, 13.3. p. 63.

a representation of the future promise by a kind
of mortal resurrection, in order that the name of
the one deceased might be perpetuated ; -
whereas then some of those who are inserted
in this genealogical table succeeded by nat
ural descent, the son to the father, while others,
though born of one father, were ascribed by
name to another, mention was made of both -
of those who were progenitors in fact and
of those who were so only in name. Thus
neither of the gospels is in error, for one
reckons by nature, the other by law.
For the
line of descent from Solomon and that from
Nathan " were so involved, the one with the
other, by the raising up of children to the child
less and by second marriages, that the same per
sons are justly considered to belong at one time
to one, at another time to another ; that is, at
one time to the reputed fathers, at another to
the actual fathers.

are strictly true and come down to Joseph with
considerable intricacy indeed, yet quite ac

the object proposed to us, it must be shown
how it is that each is recorded to be his father,
both Jacob, who derived his descent from Solo
mon, and Eli, who derived his from Nathan ;
first how it is that these two, Jacob and Eli, were
brothers, and then how it is that their fathers,
Matthan and Melchi, although of different fami
lies, are declared to be grandfathers of Jo
seph.
Matthan and Melchi having married
in succession the same woman, begat chil
dren who were uterine brothers, for the law did
not prohibit a widow, whether such by divorce or
by the death of her husband, from marrying
another.
By Estha' then (for this was the
woman's name according to tradition) Mat
than, a descendant of Solomon, first begat Jacob.

5 Nathan was a son of I)avid and Pathshcba, and therefore own

brother of Solomon.

* Melchi, who is here given as the third from the end, is in our
present texts of Luke the sisth (Luke iii. 24), Matthat and I cvi
standing between Melchi and Eli.
It is highly probable that the
text which Africanus followed omitted the two names Matthat and
Levi (see Westcott and Hort's Greek Testament, Appendix, p. 57).
It is impossible to suppose that Africanus in such an investigation
as this could have overlooked two names by mistake if they had
stood in his text of the Gospels.

* We know nothing more of Estha.

Africanus probably refers
to the tradition handed down by the relatives of Christ, who had, as
he says, preserved genealogies which agreed with those of the Gos.
pels. He distinguishes here what he gives on tradition from his
own interpretation of the Gospel discrepancy upon which he is
engaged.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[I. 7.

And when Matthan was dead, Melchi, who traced
his descent back to Nathan, being of the same
tribe" but of another family," married her,
as before said, and begat a son Eli. Thus
we shall find the two, Jacob and Eli, al
though belonging to different families, yet breth
ren by the same mother.
Of these the one,

hand, says: "Who was the son, as was supposed"
(for this he also adds), ‘of Joseph, the son of

10 All the MSS. and editions of Eusebius read rptrov instead of
vior here. But it is very difficult to make any sense out of the word
Tptrov in this connection. We therefore prefer to follow Spitta (see
i&id., pp. 87 sqq.) in reading vow instead of Tptrov, an emendation
which he has ventured to make upon the authority of Rufinus, who
translates " genuit Joseph filium suum," showing no trace of a Tpi
row. The word Tp(row is wanting also in ..". Catenae which
contain the fragments of Africanus' Epistle (compare Spitta, ibid.
p. 117, note 12).

11 kara Aoyov. These words have caused translators and com
mentators great difficulty, and most of them seem to have missed
their significance entirely.
Spitta proposes to alter by reading kara
Aoyov, but the emendation is unnecessary. The remarks which he
makes (p. 89 sqq.) upon the relation between this sentence and the
next are, however, excellent.
It was necessary to Africanus' theory
that Joseph should be allowed to trace his lineage through Jacob,
his father "by nature," as well as through Eli, his father "by law,"
and hence the words kara Aoyov are added and emphasized. He
was his son by nature and therefore "rightfully to be reckoned as
his son."
This explains the Biblical quotation which follows:
"Wherefore " - because he was Jacob's son by nature and could
rightfully be reckoned in his line, and not only in the line of Eli-
"it is written," &c.
12 Matt. i. 6.
* See Rev. John Lightfoot's remarks on Luke iii. 23, in his

Pich rew and Tasm redical E. rercitations on St. Lockr.

* This passage has caused much trouble.

Valesius remarks,
"Africanus wishes to refer the words tos évoutgero (‘as was sup
posed") not only to the words toos 'Io a mob, but also to the words
row ‘HA, which follow, which although it is acute is nevertheless
improper and foolish; for if Luke indicates that legal generation or
adoption by the words as evout Sero, as Africanus claims, it would
follow that Christ was the son of Joseph by legal adoption in the
same way that Joseph was the son of Eli. And thus it would be
said that Mary, after the death of Joseph, married his brother, and
that Christ was begotten by him, which is impious and absurd. And
besides, if these words, tos evoutgero, are extended to the words row
‘HAt, in the same way they can be extended to all which follow. For
there is no reason why they should be supplied in the second grade
and not in the others."
But against Valesius, Stroth says that Africanus seeks nothing in
the "...i. dos & voutgero, but in the fact that Luke says "he was the
son of," while Matthew says "he begat."
Stroth's interpretation is
followed by Closs, Heinichen, and others, but Routh follows Vale
sius.
Spitta discusses the matter carefully (p. 91 sq.), agreeing with
Valesius that Africanus lays the emphasis upon the words tos évout
gero, but by an emendation (introducing a second tos évoutgero, and
reading "who was the son, as was supposed, of Joseph, the son of
Jacob, who was himself also the son, as was supposed, - for this he
also adds, - of Eli, the son of Melchi") he applies the dos évoutgero
only to the first and second members, and takes it in a more general
sense to cover both cases, thus escaping Walesius' conclusions ex
pressed above. The conjecture is ingenious, but is unwarranted and

his genealogical table up to the end, tracing the
genealogy back to Adam the son of God.
This interpretation is neither incapable of
proof nor is it an idle conjecture."
For
the relatives of our Lord according to the flesh,
whether with the desire of boasting or simply
wishing to state the fact, in either case truly,
have handed down the following account: "
Some Idumean robbers," having attacked Asca
lon, a city of Palestine, carried away from a
temple of Apollo which stood near the walls, in
addition to other booty, Antipater, son of a cer
tain temple slave named Herod. And since the
priest" was not able to pay the ransom for his
son, Antipater was brought up in the customs of
the Idumeans, and afterward was befriended
by Hyrcanus, the high priest of the Jews.
And having been sent by Hyrcanus on an
embassy to Pompey, and having restored to

unnecessary. The words which occur in the next sentence, "and
the expression," he begat' he has omitted," show that Africanus, as
Stroth contends, lays the emphasis upon the difference of form in the
two genealogies, "Son of" and "he begat." The best explanation
seems to me to be that Africanus supposes Luke to have implied the
legal generation in the words "the Son of," used in distinction from
the definite expression "he begat," and that the words tos évout
geto, which "he also adds," simply emphasize this difference of ex
pression by introducing a still greater ambiguity into Luke's mode
of statement. He not only uses the words, the "Son of," which have
a wide latitude, admitting any kind of sonship, but "he also adds,"
" as was supposed," showing, in Africanus' opinion, still more
clearly that §: list which follows is far from being a closely defined
table of descent by "natural generation."

* This seems the best possible rendering of the Greek, which
reads row &vaqopaw mounord oevos évos toū ‘A&au, row 6eoû kar' divā
Avaiv.
ovće unv divarð6e artov K.T.A., which is very dark, punctu
atcd thus, and it is difficult to understand what is meant by kar'
ava avoiv in connection with the preceding words. (Cruse translates,
"having traced it back as far as Adam, "who was the son of God,'
he ... the whole series by referring back to God. Neither is
this incapable of proof, nor is it an idle conjecture."). The objec
tions which Spitta brings against the sentence in this form are well
founded. He contends (p. 63 sqq.), and that rightly, that Africanus
could not have written the sentence thus.
In restoring the original
epistle of Africanus, therefore, he throws the words xar' divaAvoriv
into the next sentence, which disposes of the difficulty, and makes
good sense. We should then read, "having traced it back as far as
Adam, the Son of God. This interpretation (more literally, "as an
interpretation,' or ‘by way of interpretation') is neither incapable
of proof, nor is it an idle conjecture." That Africanus wrote thus I
am convinced.
But as Spitta shows, Eusebius must have divided
the sentences as they now stand, for, according to his idea, that
Africanus' account was one which he had received by tradition, the
other mode of reading would be incomprehensible, though he proba
bly did not understand much better the meaning of kar' avaavgov
as he placed it.
In translating Africanus' epistle here, I have felt
justified in rendering it as Africanus probably wrote it, instead of
following Eusebius' incorrect reproduction of it.

* The Greek reads: Tape&oaav Kai Touro, "have handed down
also." The Kat occurs in all the MSS. and versions of Eusebius,
and was undoubtedly written by him, but Spitta supposes it an addi
tion of Eusebius, caused, like the change in the previous sentence,
by his erroneous conception of the nature of Africanus' interpreta
tion. The kai is certainly troublesome is we suppose that all that pre
cedes is Africanus' own interpretation of the Biblical lists, and not a
traditional account handed down by the "relatives of our Lord"; and
this, in spite of Eusebius' belief, we must certainly insist upon. We
may therefore assume with Spitta that the Kai did not stand in the
original epistle as Africanus wrote it. The question arises, if what
precedes is not given upon the authority of the "relatives of our
Lord," why then is this account introduced upon their testimony, as
if confirming the preceding? We may simply refer again to Africa
nus' words at the end of the extract (§ 15 below) to prove that his
interpretation did not rest upon testimony, and then we may answer
with Spitta that their testimony, which is appealed to in § 14 below,
was to the genealogies themselves, and in this Africanus wishes it to
be known that they confirmed the Gospel lists.
17 See above, ... VI. notes 5 an 6.
* We should expect the word "temple-servant" again instead of
"priest"; but, as Valesius remarks, o was possible for the same
person to be both priest and servant, if sor instance it was a condi
tion of priesthood that only captives should be made priests." And
this was really the case in many places.

51 "Judea" is here used in the wider sense of Palestine as a

The word is occasionally used in this sense in Josephus; and so
in Matt. xix. 1, and Mark x. 1, we read of "the coasts of Judea be
yond |. Ptolemy, Dion Cassius, and Strabo habitually em
ploy the word in the wide sense.
These words are not found in any extant MSS.,
but I have followed Stroth and others in supplying them for the
following reasons. The Greek, as we have it, runs : x at row mpo
retuéony Yeveaaoyian ex re Tris BiBAov row huepow k.T.A. The
particle Te indicates plainly that some phrase has fallen out. Ru
finus translates ordine on supra dictae generation is A a r tim
m e on or i t e r part on etia in e-r die rum ori's in quantum
crat perdocebant. The words fartim memoritor find no equiva:
lent in the Greek as we have it, but the particle re, which still
remains, shows that words which Rufinus translated thus must
have stood originally in the Greek. The Syriac version also con
firms the conclusion that something stood in the original which
has since disappeared, though the rendering which it gives rests
evidently upon a corrupt text (cf. Spitta, p. 10).
Walesius sug.
gests the insertion of amo uviums, though he does not place the
phrase in his text. Heinichen supplies unnuove voravres, and is
followed by Closs in his translation.
Stroth, Migne, Routh, and
Spitta read ox uriums. The sense is essentially the same in each
Case.

83 It has been the custom since Walesius, to consider this "Book
of daily records" (B.BAos tow huepow) the same as the "private
records" (tóworkäs amoypadās) mentioned just above.
But this
opinion has been combated by Spitta, and that with perfect right.
he sentence is, in fact, an exact parallel to the scntence just
above, where it is said that a few of the careful, either by means of
their memory or by means of copies, were able to have "private
records of their own." In the present sentence it is said that "they
drew the aforesaid genealogy (viz.,
the private records of their
own") from memory, or from the Book of daily records" (which
corresponds to the copies referred to above). This book cf daily
records is clearly, therefore, something other than , the i8, wrikas
&moypadas, but exactly what we are to understand by it is not so
easy to say.
It cannot denote the regular public records (called the
archives above), for these were completed, and would not need to
be supplemented by memory; and apparently, according to Afri
canus' opinion, these private records were made after the destruction
of the regular public ones. The "Book of daily records" referred
to must have been at any rate an incomplete genealogical source
needing to be supplemented by the memory.
Private family record
books, if such existed previous to the supposed destruction of the
public records, of which we have no evidence, would in all prob
ability have been complete for each family.
Spitta maintains
(p. 1 or sq.) that the Book of Chronicles is meant: the Hebrew
co- "i", words or records of the days.
This is a very at
tractive suggestion, as the book exactly corresponds to the book
described: the genealogies which it gives are incomplete and re
quire supplementing, and it is a book which was accessible to all;
public, therefore, and yet not involved in the supposed destruc
tion. The difficulty lies in the name given.
It is true that Jerome
calls the Books of Chronicles I eróa Dieru mt and Hilary Sez:-
momes Dierum, &c.; but we should expect Africanus to use here
the technical LXX. designation, IIa oaxes towevor'. . But whatever
this "Book of daily records" was, it cannot have been the "pri
vate records" which were formed "from memory and from copies,"
but was one of the sources from which those "private records '
were drawn.

WHEN Christ was born, according to the
prophecies, in Bethlehem of Judea, at the
time indicated, Herod was not a little disturbed
by the enquiry of the magi who came from the

(not interpretation), in spite of the burning of the public records
by Herod.

instance of the limited nature of the law that Mary and Eliza.
beth were relatives, although Joseph and Mary belonged to the
tribe of Judah, and Zacharias, at least, was a Levite. This example
lay so near at hand that Eusebius should not have overlooked it
in making his assertion. His argument, therefore, in proof of the
fact that Mary belonged to the tribe of Judah has no force, but the
fact itself is abundantly established both by the unanimous tradition
of antiquity (independent of Luke's genealogy, which was universally
supposed to be that of Joseph), and by such passages as Ps. cxxxii.

It is
worth while, in addition to this, to observe
the reward which Herod received for his daring
crime against Christ and those of the same age.
For immediately, without the least delay, the
divine vengeance overtook him while he was
still alive, and gave him a foretaste of what
he was to receive after death.
It is not
possible to relate here how he tarnished
the supposed felicity of his reign by successive
calamities in his family, by the murder of wife
and children, and others of his nearest relatives
and dearest friends." The account, which casts
every other tragic drama into the shade, is de
tailed at length in the histories of Josephus."
How, immediately after his crime against
our Saviour and the other infants, the pun
ishment sent by God drove him on to his death,
we can best learn from the words of that historian
who, in the seventeenth book of his Antiquities
of the Jews, writes as follows concerning
his end : ""But the disease of Herod grew
more severe, God inflicting punishment for
his crimes. For a slow fire burned in him which
was not so apparent to those who touched him,
but augmented his internal distress; for he had
a terrible desire for food which it was not pos
sible to resist. He was affected also with ulcera
tion of the intestines, and with especially severe
pains in the colon, while a watery and trans
parent humor settled about his feet. He
suffered also from a similar trouble in his
abdomen. Nay more, his privy member was
putrefied and produced worms. He found also
excessive difficulty in breathing, and it was par

most of the time cntirely undisturbed by external troubles; but his
domestic life was embittered by a constant succession of tragedies
resulting from the mutual jealousies of his wives (of whom he had
ten) and of their children.
Early in his reign he slew Hyrcanus,
the grandfather of his best-loved wife Mariamne, upon suspicion of
treason; a little later, Marianne herself was put to death; in 6 p.c.
her sons, Alexander and Aristobulus, were condemned and executed:
and in 4 p.c., but a few days before his death, Antipater, his eldest
son, who had been instrumental in the condemnation of Alexander
and Aristobulus, was also slain by his orders.
These murders were
accompanied by many others of friends and kindred, who were con
stantly falling under suspicion of treason.

was said, indeed, by those who possessed the
power of divination and wisdom to explain such
events, that God had inflicted this punishment
upon the King on account of his great impiety."
The writer mentioned above recounts these
things in the work referred to. And in
the second book of his History he gives
a similar account of the same Herod, which runs
as follows:" "The disease then seized upon his
whole body and distracted it by various tor
ments.
For he had a slow fever, and the itch
ing of the skin of his whole body was insupporta
ble. He suffered also from continuous pains in
his colon, and there were swellings on his feet
like those of a person suffering from dropsy,
while his abdomen was inflamed and his privy
member so putrefied as to produce worms. Be
sides this he could breathe only in an upright
posture, and then only with difficulty, and he had
convulsions in all his limbs, so that the diviners
said that his diseases were a punishment."
But he, although wrestling with such suffer
ings, nevertheless clung to life and hoped
for safety, and devised methods of cure.
For
instance, crossing over Jordan he used the warm
baths at Callirhoë," which flow into the Lake As
phaltites," but are themselves sweet enough
to drink.
His physicians here thought that
they could warm his whole body again by
means of heated oil.
But when they had let
him down into a tub filled with oil, his eyes be

person.
But when his attendants raised an out
cry, he recovered at the noise; but finally, de

drachms to be distributed among the soldiers,
and great sums to be given to his generals
and friends. Then returning he came to

ment better correspond with his own words in Amt. XVII. 6, quoted
just above, where his disease is said to have been a result of his im

n the other hand, the omission of the words in Amt. XVII. 6
casts at least a suspicion on their genuineness, and if we were to
assume that the words did not occur in the original text of Josephus,
it would be very easy to understand their insertion by some copyist,

Sophists, and of Herod's cruel treatment of them.

choly, he planned to commit an impious deed,
as if challenging death itself.
For, collecting
from every town the most illustrious men of all
Judea, he commanded that they be shut up
in the so-called hippodrome. And having
summoned Salome," his sister, and her hus
band, Alexander," he said: ‘I know that the Jews
will rejoice at my death. But I may be lamented
by others and have a splendid funeral if you are
willing to perform my commands. When I shall
expire surround these men, who are now under
guard, as quickly as possible with soldiers, and
slay them, in order that all Judea and every house
may weep for me even against their will.'""
And after a little Josephus says, "And again
he was so tortured by want of food and by
a convulsive cough that, overcome by his pains,
he planned to anticipate his fate. Taking an
apple he asked also for a knife, for he was accus
tomed to cut apples and eat them. Then look
ing round to see that there was no one to hinder,
he raised his right hand as if to stab him
self.""
In addition to these things the
same writer records that he slew another of
his own sons" before his death, the third one
slain by his command, and that immediately
afterward he breathed his last, not without ex
cessive pain.

Such was the end of Herod, who suffered
a just punishment for his slaughter of the
children of Bethlehem," which was the result
of his plots against our Saviour.
After this
an angel appeared in a dream to Joseph in
Egypt and commanded him to go to Judea with
the child and its mother, revealing to him that
those who had sought the life of the child were
dead." To this the evangelist adds, "But when
he heard that Archelaus did reign in the room
of his father Herod he was afraid to go thither;
notwithstanding being warned of God in a dream
he turned aside into the parts of Galilee."."

The Times of Pisafe.

THE historian already mentioned agrees
with the evangelist in regard to the fact
that Archelaus' succeeded to the government
after Herod. He records the manner in which
he received the kingdom of the Jews by the
will of his father Herod and by the decree of
Caesar Augustus, and how, after he had reigned
ten years, he lost his kingdom, and his brothers

writer, in the eighteenth book of his Antiquities,"
says that about the twelfth year of the reign of
Tiberius," who had succeeded to the empire
after Augustus had ruled fifty-seven years, Pon

1 Archelaus was a son of Herod the Great, and own brother of
the Tetrarch Herod Antipas, with whom he was educated at Rome.
Immediately after the death of Antipater he was designated by his
father as his successor in the kingdom, and Augustus ratified the
will, but gave him only the title of ethnarch. The title of King he
never really received, although he is spoken of as king in Matt. ii.
22, the word being used in a loose sense.
His dominion consisted
of Idumea, Judea, Samaria, and the cities on the coast, comprising
a half of his father's kingdom. The other half was divided between
Herod Antipas and Philip. He was very cruel, and was warmly
hated by most of his subjects.
In the tenth year of his reign (ac
cording to Josephus, Amt. XVII. 13. 2), or in the ninth (according
to B. o. II. 7.3), he was complained against by his brothers and
subjects on se ground of cruelty, and was banished to Vienne in
Gaul, where he probably died, otho, Jerome says that he was
shown his tomb near Bethlehem.
Jerome's report, however, is too
late to be of any value. The exact length of his reign it is impos
sible to say, as Josephus is not consistent in his reports. The
difference may be due to the fact that Josephus reckoned from
different starting-points in the two cases. #. probably ruled a
little more than nine years.
His condemnation took place in the
consulship of M. Aemilius, Lepidus and L., Arruntius (i.e. in
6 A.D.) according to Dion Cassius, LV. 27.
After the deposition
of Archelaus Judea was made a Roman province and attached
to Syria, and Coponius was sent as the first procurator. On Arche

* The Lysanias referred to here is mentioned in Luke iii. 1 as
Tetrarch of Abilene.
Eusebius, in speaking of Lysanias here,
follows the account of Luke, not that of Josephus, for the latter
nowhere says that Lysanias continued to rule his tetrarchy after the
exile of Archelaus.
Indeed he nowhere states that Lvsanias ruled a
tetrarchy at this period. He only refers (Ant. XVIII. 6. 10; XIX.
5. 1:... XX. { 1; and B. 9. II. 12. 8) to "the tetrarchy of Lysa
nias," which he says was given to Agrippa I. and II. by Caligula
and Claudius.
Eusebius thus reads more into Josephus than he has
any right to do, and yet we cannot assume that he is guilty of willful
deception, for he may quite innocently have interpreted Josephus in
the light of Luke's account, without realizing that Josephus' state
ment is of itself entirely indefinite.
That there is no real contra
diction between the statements of Josephus and Luke has been
abundantly demonstrated by Davidson, Introduction to the New
Testament, I. p. 215 sq.

made procurator of Judea by Tiberius in the
twelfth year of his reign.

It was in the fifteenth year of the reign
of Tiberius," according to the evangelist,
and in the fourth year of the governorship of
Pontius Pilate," while Herod and Lysanias and
Philip were ruling the rest of Judea," that our
Saviour and Lord, Jesus the Christ of God, being
about thirty years of age," came to John for bap
tism and began the promulgation of the
Gospel. The Divine Scripture says, moreover, that he passed the entire time of his
ministry under the high priests Annas and
Caiaphas," showing that in the time which be

Eusebius reckons the fifteenth year of Tiberius
from 14 A.D., that is, from the time when he became sole emperor.
There is a difference of opinion among commentators as to whether
Luke began to reckon from the colleagueship of Tiberius (11 or
12 A.D.), or from the beginning of his reign as sole emperor. Either
mode of reckoning is allowable, but as Luke says that Christ be
gan to be about thirty years of age" at this time, and as he was born
probably about 4 b.c., the former seems to have been Luke's mode.
Compare Andrew's Life of our Lord, p. 28.

year of Tiberius, for in that year Pilate became procurator.
In the
fifteenth year of Tiberius, Christ began his work when Caiaphas
had already been high priest three years, and according to the false
account of our author he became high priest for the first time in the
nineteenth year of Tiberius. The whole structure of this chapter,
therefore, falls to the ground.
It is almost inconceivable how so
prudent a man could have committed so great a mistake of the same

longed to the priesthood of those two men the
whole period of his teaching was completed.
Since he began his work during the high priest
hood of Annas and taught until Caiaphas held
the office, the entire time does not com
prise quite four years.
For the rites of the
law having been already abolished since
that time, the customary usages in connection
with the worship of God, according to which
the high priest acquired his office by hereditary
descent and held it for life, were also annulled,
and there were appointed to the high priesthood
by the Roman governors now one and now an
other person who continued in office not
more than one year." Josephus relates that
there were four high priests in succession
from Annas to Caiaphas. Thus in the same
book of the Antiquities' he writes as follows:
"Valerius Gratus" having put an end to the
priesthood of Ananus" appoints Ishmael," the
son of Fabi, high priest. And having removed
him after a little he appoints Eleazer," the son
of Ananus the high priest, to the same office.
And having removed him also at the end of a
year he gives the high priesthood to Simon," the
son of Camithus.
But he likewise held the
honor no more than a year, when Josephus,
called also Caiaphas," succeeded him." Ac

sort as that which he had denounced a little before in connection
with the Acts of Pilate."

The whole confusion is due to Eusebius' mistaken interpretation
of the Gospel account, which he gives in this sentence. ... It is now
universally assumed that Annas is named by the evangelists as ex
high-priest, but Eusebius, not understanding this, supposed that a
part of Christ's ministry must have fallen during the active adminis
tration of Annas, a part during that of Caiaphas, and therefore his
ministry must have run from the one to the other, embracing the
intermediate administrations of Ishmael, Eleazer, and Simon, and cov
ering less than four years.
In order to make this out he interprets
the "not long after" in connection with Ishmael as meaning "one
ear," which is incorrect, as shown below in note 9. How Euse
ius could have overlooked the plain fact that all this occurred under
Valerius Gratus instead of Pilate, and therefore many years too
early (when he himself states the fact), is almost incomprehensible.
Absorbed in making out his interpretation, he must have thought
lessly confounded the names of Gratus and Pilate while reading the
account. He cannot have acted knowingly, with the intention to
deceive, for he must have seen that anybody reading his account
would discover the glaring discrepancy at once.

• It is true that under the Roman governors the high priests
were frequently changed (cf. above, chap. 6, note 19), but there was
no regularly prescribed interval, and some continued in office for
many years; for instance, op. was high priest for more than

remained in office until A.D. 14 or 15, when he was deposed by
Valerius Gratus (tā. Ś 2).
This forms another instance, therefore,
of a term of office more than one year in length. Annas is a famil
iar personage from his connection with the Gospel history; but the
exact position which he occupied during Christ's ministry is difficult
to determine (cf. Wieseler's Chronology of the Life of Christ).

cordingly the whole time of our Saviour's min
istry is shown to have been not quite four full
years, four high priests, from Annas to the acces
sion of Caiaphas, having held office a year each.
The Gospel therefore has rightly indicated Caia
phas as the high priest under whom the Saviour
suffered.
From which also we can see that the
time of our Saviour's ministry does not disagree
with the foregoing investigation.

Our Saviour and Lord, not long after the
beginning of his ministry, called the twelve
apostles," and these alone of all his disciples
he named apostles, as an especial honor. And
again he appointed seventy others whom he sent
out two by two before his face into every place
and city whither he himself was about to come."

Not long after this John the Baptist was
beheaded by the younger Herod," as is
stated in the Gospels."
Josephus also records
the same fact," making mention of Herodias" by
name, and stating that, although she was the
wife of his brother, Herod made her his own wife
after divorcing his former lawful wife, who was
the daughter of Aretas," king of Petra, and sepa
rating Herodias from her husband while he
was still alive.
It was on her account also
that he slew John, and waged war with
Aretas, because of the disgrace inflicted on the
daughter of the latter.
Josephus relates that in
this war, when they came to battle, Herod's
entire army was destroyed," and that he suffered
this calamity on account of his crime against
John.

The same Josephus confesses in this ac
count that John the Baptist was an exceed
ingly righteous man, and thus agrees with the
things written of him in the Gospels. He records
also that Herod lost his kingdom on account of

banishment with her, and condemned to
live at Vienne in Gaul." He relates these
things in the eighteenth book of the An
tiquities, where he writes of John in the following
words : * "It seemed to some of the Jews that
the army of Herod was destroyed by God, who
most justly avenged John called the Baptist.
For Herod slew him, a good man and one
who exhorted the Jews to come and receive
baptism, practicing virtue and exercising right
eousness toward each other and toward God; for
baptism would appear acceptable unto Him when
they employed it, not for the remission of certain
sins, but for the purification of the body, as the
soul had been already purified in righteous
ness.
And when others gathered about
him (for they found much pleasure in listen
ing to his words), Herod feared that his great
influence might lead to some sedition, for they
appeared ready to do whatever he might adviso.
e therefore considered it much better, before
any new thing should be done under John's in
fluence, to anticipate it by slaying him, than to
repent after revolution had come, and when he
found himself in the midst of difficulties." On
account of Herod's suspicion John was sent in

Ewald remarks with truth, "When Josephus, however, gives as the

it in that connection in the previous paragraph.

there remains almost nothing; and it seems inconceivable that Jose
phus should have given so colorless a report of one whom the Jews
regarded with such enmity, if he mentioned him at all. The fourth
view might be possible, and is more natural than the third; but it
seems as if some trace of the original calumny would have survived
somewhere, had it ever existed. . To me, however, the decisive
argument is the decided break which the passage makes in the con
text; $ 2 gives the account of a sedition of the Jews, and § 4 opens
with the words, "About the same time also another, sad calamity
put the Jews into disorder"; while $ 3, containing, the account of

It has been suggested that Eusebius himself, who is the first one

is possible, but there is no reason to suppose it true, for it is con

in which he introduces the quotation both here and in his Dem.

Clement of Alexandria

(Stromt. II. 2d) calls Barnabas one of the Seventy.
This tradition
is not in itself improbable, but we can trace it j no further than
Clement. The Clementine Recognitions and Homilies frequently
mention Barnabas as an apostle active in Alexandria and in Rome.
One tradition sends him to Milan and makes him the first bishop of
the church there, but the silence of Ambrose in regard to it is a
sufficient proof of its groundlessness. There is extant an o
work, probably of the fifth o: entitled Acta et Passio Bar
siąśa in Cypro, which relates his death by martyrdom in Cyprus.
The tradition may be true, but its existence has no weight. Bar
nabas came from Cyprus and labored there for at least a time.
It
would be natural, therefore, to assign his death (which was neces
sarily martyrdom, for no Christian writer of the early centuries could
have admitted that he died a natural death) to that place.

THE DISCIPLES OF OUR SAVIOUR.

and especially Paul in his Epistle to the Gala
tians." They say that Sosthenes also, who wrote to
the Corinthians with Paul, was one of them."
This is the account of Clement" in the fifth
book of his Hypotyposes, in which he also
says that Cephas was one of the seventy disciples,'
a man who bore the same name as the apostle
Peter, and the one concerning whom Paul says,
"When Cephas came to Antioch I with

Matthias," also,
who was numbered with the apostles in the
place of Judas, and the one who was honored
by being made a candidate with him," are like
wise said to have been deemed worthy of the same
calling with the seventy.
They say that Thad
deus" also was one of them, concerning whom
I shall presently relate an account which has
come down to us." And upon examination
you will find that our Saviour had more than
seventy disciples, according to the testimony of
Paul, who says that after his resurrection from
the dead he appeared first to Cephas, then to the
twelve, and after them to above five hundred
brethren at once, of whom some had fallen
asleep ; " but the majority were still living

5 Sosthenes is mentioned in I Cor. i. 1. From what source Euse
bius drew this report in regard to him I cannot tell. He is the first
to mention it, so far as I know. A later tradition reports that he
became Bishop of Colophon, a city in Ionia. A Sosthenes is men
tioned also in Acts xviii. 17, as ruler of the Jewish synagogue in
Corinth. Some wish to identify the two, supposing the latter to
have been afterward converted, but in this case of course he cannot
have been one of the Seventy.
Eusebius' tradition is one in regard
to whose value we can form no opinion.

* On Clement and his works see Bk. V. chap. 11, note 1, and

Bk. VI. chap. 13.

7 Clement is, so far as I know, the first to make this distinction
between Peter the Apostle, and Cephas, one of the Seventy;. The
reason for the invention of a second Peter in the post-apostolic age
is easy to understand as resulting from the desire to do away with
the conflict between two apostles.
This Cephas appears frequently
in later traditions and is commemorated in the Menology of Basil
on December 9, and in the Armenian calendar on September 25. In
the Ecclesiastical Canons he is made one of the twelve apostles,
and distinguished from Peter.

* Gal. ii. 11.

* Joseph #. surnamed Justus.

* We learn from Acts i. 21 sqq. that Matthias was a follower of
Christ throughout his ministry, and therefore the tradition, which
Eusebius is, so far as we know, the first to record, is not at all im
robable.
Epiphanius (at the close of the first book of his Haer.,
indorf's ed. I. p. 337) a half-century later records the same tradition.
Nicephorus Callistus (II. 40) says that he labored and suffered mar
tyrdom in Ethiopia (probably meaning Caucasian Ethiopia, east of the
Black Sea). Upon the Gospel of Matthias see below, Is I. 25, note 30.
He, too, had been with
Christ from the beginning, and therefore may well have been one of

* From a comparison of the different lists of apostles given by
Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Thaddeus is seen to be one of the Twelve,
apparently identical with Jude and Lebbeus (compare Jerome, /n
Matt. X.). Eusebius here sunders him from the apostles and makes
him one of the Seventy, committing an error similar to that which
arose in the case of Peter and Cephas. He perhaps records only an
oral ::adition, as he uses the word 'baai. He is, so far as is known,
the first to mention the tradition.

since in addition to these, there were many
others who were called apostles, in imitation of

"Afterward he appeared to all the apostles.""
So much in regard to these persons.
But the
story concerning Thaddeus is as follows.

puted matter. Three theories have been advanced, and are all
widely represented.

The first is the full-brother hypothesis, according to which the
brothers and sisters of Jesus were children of both Joseph and Mary.
This was advocated strongly by the heretic Helvidius in Rome in
38o, and is widely A. in the Protestant Church. The only
serious objection to it is the committal of Mary to the care of John
by Christ upon the cross.
But John was at any rate an own cousin
#}". and the objection loses its weight when we realize the
spiritual sympathy which existed between †". and John, and the
lack of belief exhibited by his own brothers. The second is the half
brother hypothesis, which regards the brethren and sisters of Jesus
as children of Joseph by a former wife. This has, the oldest tradi:
tion in its favor (though the tradition for none of the theories is old
or universal enough to be of great weight), the apocryphal Gosfe!
of Żames, chap. ix., recording that Joseph was a widower and had
children before marrying Mary. It is still the established, theory in
the Greek Church. The greatest objection to it is that if it be true,
Christ, as a younger son of Joseph, could not have been regarded
as the heir to the throne of I}.} That the objection is absolutely
fatal cannot be asserted, for it is nowhere clearly stated that he was
the heir-apparent to the throne; it is said only that he was of the
line of David.
Both of these theories agree in distinguishing James,
the brother of the Lord, from James, the son of Alphaeus, the
apostle, and thus assume at least three Jameses in the New Tes
tament.
Over against both of them is to be mentioned a third,
which assumes only two Jameses, regarding the brethren of the Lord
as his cousins, and identifying them with the sons of Alphaeus.
This theory originated with Jerome in 383 A.D. with the confessedly
dogmatic object of preserving the virginity, both of Mary and of

established theory in the Latin Church, and is advocated also by
many Protestant scholars. The original and common form of the
theory makes Jesus and James maternal cousins: .# only three
women in John xix. 25, and regarding Mary, the wife of Clopas, as

rests upon poor exegesis.
It is far better to assume that four women
are mentioned in this passage. A second form of the cousin theory,
which regards Jesus and James as paternal cousins - making Al
phaeus (Clopas) the brother of Joseph - originated with Lange;
t is very ingenious, and urges in its support the authority of
Hegesippus, who, according to Eusebius (H.A.. III. 11), says that
Clopas was the brother of jo and the father of Simeon, which
would make the latter the brother of James, and thus just as truly
the brother of the Lord as he.
But Hegesippus plainly thinks of
James and of Simeon as standing in different relations to Christ,--
the former his brother, the latter his cousin, - and therefore his
testimony is against, rather than for Lange's hypothesis. The state
ment of łł. indeed, expresses the cousinship of Christ with
James the Little, the son of Clopas (if Alphaeus and Clopas be iden
tified), but does not identify this cousin with James the brother of

the Lord.
theory, but his exegesis of the passage to which he appeals is poor
(see below, Bk. IV. chap. 22, note 4).
Against both forms of the
cousin theory may be urged the natural meaning of the word āSea
dos, and also the statement of John vii. 5, "Neither did his brethren
believe in him," which makes it impossible to suppose that his
brothers were apostles.
From this fatal objection both of the
brother hypotheses are free, and either of them is possible, but the
former rests upon a more natural interpretation of the various pas:
sages involved, and would perhaps have been universally accepted
had it not been for the dogmatic interest felt by the early Church in
Renan's complicated o (see
reserving the virginity of Mary.

need not be discussed here. #. is much to be said, however, in
favor of the separation of Alphaeus and Clopas, upon which he
insists and o involves the existence of four Jameses instead of
only three.

of our Lord, pp. 104-116), Schaff (Church Hist. I. 272-275), and
Weiss (Einleitung in das M. T. p. 388 sqq.), all of whom defend the
natural brother hypothosis: Lightfoot (Excursus upon "The Breth
ren of the Lord" in his Commentary got Galaţia ms, 2d ed. p.
247-282), who is the strongest advocate of the half-brother theory;
Mill (The Accounts of our Lord's Brethren in the AW. T.

theory; and Lange (in Herzog), who presents the paternal cousin
hypothesis. Compare finally Holtzmann's article in the Zeitschrist

THE divinity of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ being noised abroad among all
men on account of his wonder-working power,
he attracted countless numbers from foreign
countries lying far away from Judea, who had the
hope of being cured of their diseases and
of all kinds of sufferings.
For instance,
the King Abgarus,' who ruled with great
glory the nations beyond the Euphrates, being
afflicted with a terrible disease which it was be
yond the power of human skill to cure, when he
heard of the name of Jesus, and of his mira
cles, which were attested by all with one accord,
sent a message to him by a courier and
begged him to heal his disease.
But he
did not at that time comply with his re
quest; yet he deemed him worthy of a personal
letter in which he said that he would send one
of his disciples to cure his disease, and at the
same time promised salvation to himself

had promised received through him its

these things taken from the archives of

* Abgarus was the name of several kings of Edessa, who reigned
at various periods from b.c. ; to A.D. 217. The Abgar contempo
rary with Christ was called Abgar Ucomo, or "the Black." He was
the fifteenth
king, and reigned, according to Gutschmid, from
A.D. 13 to A.D. 50. A great many ecclesiastical fictions have grown
up around his name, the story, contained in its simplest form in the
present chapter, being embellished with many marvelous additions.
A starting-point for this tradition of the correspondence with Christ,
- from which in turn grew all the later legends, - may be sound in
the fact that in the latter part of the second century there was a
Christian Abgar, King of {... at whose court Bardesancs, the
Syrian Gnostic, enjoyed high favor, and it is certain that Christian
ity had found a i. in this region at a much earlier period.
Soon after the time of this Abgar the pretended correspondence was
very likely forged, and foisted back upon the Abgar who was con
temporary with Christ.

Copy of an epistle written by A/garus the ruler
to Jesus, and sent to him at Jerusalem by Ana
mias' the swift courier.

"Abgarus, ruler of Edessa, to Jesus the
excellent Saviour who has appeared in the
country of Jerusalem, greeting.
I have heard the
reports of thee and of thy cures as performed by
For it is said
thee without medicines or herbs.
that thou makest the blind to see and the lame to
walk, that thou cleansest lepers and castest out
impure spirits and demons, and that thou healest
those afflicted with lingering disease, and
And having heard all
raisest the dead.
these things concerning thee, I have con
cluded that one of two things must be true:
either thou art God, and having come down
from heaven thou doest these things, or else
thou, who doest these things, art the Son
of God."
I have therefore written to thee
to ask thee that thou wouldest take the
trouble to come to me and heal the disease
which I have.
For I have heard that the Jews
are murmuring against thee and are plotting to
injure thee.
But I have a very small yet noble
city which is great enough for us both."

but this unworthy suspicion has been refuted by the discovery and
publication of the original Syriac (1% e Doct. of Adda; the Apost.e.,
with an English Translation and Motes, by G. Phillips, London,
1876; compare also Contemp. Rez., May, 1877, p. 1137). The epis:
tles were forged probably long before his day, and were supposed by
him to be genuine. His critical insight, but not his honesty, was at
fault. The apocryphal character of these letters is no longer a mat
ter ofo though Cave, and Grabe defended their genuineness
(so that Eusebius is in good company), and even in the present cen
tury Rinck. (Coer for E:/thrit des Briefoechsc/s des Kongs

know of no one else who values his critical reputation so little as to
venture upon the task.

" Eusebius does not say directly that he translated these docu
ments himself, but this seems to be the natural conclusion to be
drawn from his words. 'Hui is is used only with a vaam.bbctorov, and
not with u et abante to ov.
It is impossible, therefore, to decide with
certainty; but the documents must have been in Syriac in the Edes
sene archives, and Eusebius' words imply that, if he did not trans
late them himself, he at least employed some one else to do it. At
the end of this chapter he again uses an indefinite expression, where
rhaps it might be expected that he would tell us directly if he had

* In the greatly embellished narrative of Cedrenus (Hist. Cont
Arndium, p. 176; according to Wright, in his article on Abgar in
the Pict. of Christian Boog.) this Ananias is represented as an
artist who endeavored to take the portrait of Christ, but was dazzled
by the splendor of his countenance; whereupon Christ, having
washed his face, wiped it with a towel, which miraculously retained
an image of his features. The picture thus secured was carried back
to Edessa, and acted as a charm for the preservation of the city
against its enemies. The marvelous fortunes of the miraculous pic
ture are traced by Cedrenus through some centuries (see also Eva
grius, H. E. IV. 27).

When the report of him got abroad, it was told
Abgarus that an apostle of Jesus was come,
as he had written him.
Thaddeus began
then in the power of God to heal every
disease and infirmity, insomuch that all wondered.

he performed, he began to suspect that he was

the Old Testament; but compare Isa. vi. 9, Jer. v. 21, and Ezek. xii.
2; and also Matt. xiii. 14, Mark iv. 12, and especially Acts xxviii.
26-28 and Rom. xi. 7 sq.

11 Thomas is not commonly known by the name of Judas, and it
is possible that Eusebius, or the translator of the document, made a
mistake, and applied to Thomas a name which in the original was
iven to }. But Thomas is called Judas Thomas in the
Apocryphal Acts of Thomas, and in the Syriac Doctrina Aposto
Jorum, published by Cureton.

1: The word "apostle" is by no means confined to the twelve
apostles of Christ. The term was used very commonly in a much
wider sense, and yet the combination, "the apostle, one of the
Seventy," in this passage, does not seem natural, and we can
not avoid the conclusion that the original author of this account
did not thus describe Thaddeus.
The designation, "one of the
Seventy," carries the mind back to Christ's own appointment of
them, recorded by Luke, and the term "apostle," used in the
same connection, would naturally denote one of the Twelve *
pointed by Christ, - that is, an apostle in the narrow sense.
It
might be suggested as possible that the original, Syriac connected
the word "apostle" with Thomas, reading, "Thomas the apostle
sent Judas, who is also called Thaddeus, one of the Seventy," &c.
Such a happy confusion is not beyond the power of an ancient
translator, . most of whom little can be said in the way of praise.
That this can have been the case in the present instance, however,
account Thaddeus is called an o, and we should therefore ex
is rendered extremely improbable by the fact that throughout this
pect the designation upon the first mention of him.
It seems to me
much more probable that the words, "one of the Seventy," are an
addition of Eusebius, who has already, in two places (§ 4, above,
and chap. 12, § 3), told us that Thaddeus was one of them.
It is
probable that the original Syriac preserved the correct tradition of
Thaddeus as one of the Twelve; while Eusebius, with his false tra
dition of him as one of the Seventy, takes pains to characterize him
as such, when he is first introduced, but allows the word "apostle,"
so common in its wider sense, to stand throughout. He does not
intend to correct the Syriac original; he simply defines Thaddeus,
as he understands him, more closely.

** Tobias was very likely a Jew, or of Jewish extraction, the
name being a familiar one among the Hebrews.
This might have
been the reason that Thaddeus (if he went to Edessa at all) made
his home with him.

"After I have been taken up I will send to thee
one of my disciples who will heal thee."
Therefore, summoning Tobias, with whom 12
Thaddeus lodged, he said, I have heard
that a certain man of power has come and is
lodging in thy house.
Bring him to me. And
Tobias coming to Thaddeus said to him, The
ruler Abgarus summoned me and told me to
bring thee to him that thou mightst heal him.
And Thaddeus said, I will go, for I have
been sent to him with power.
Tobias
therefore arose early on the following day,
and taking Thaddeus came to Abgarus. And
when he came, the nobles were present and
stood about Abgarus. And immediately upon
his entrance a great vision appeared to Abgarus
in the countenance of the apostle Thaddeus.
When Abgarus saw it he prostrated himself be
fore Thaddeus, while all those who stood about
were astonished ; for they did not see the
vision, which appeared to Abgarus alone.
He then asked Thaddeus if he were in
truth a disciple of Jesus the Son of God, who
had said to him, ‘I will send thee one of my
disciples, who shall heal thee and give thee life.'
And Thaddeus said, Because thou hast mightily
believed in him that sent me, therefore have I
been sent unto thee. And still further, if thou
believest in him, the petitions of thy heart
shall be granted thee as thou believest. And
Abgarus said to him, So much have I be
lieved in him that I wished to take an army and
destroy those Jews who crucified him, had I not
been deterred from it by reason of the dominion
of the Romans. And Thaddeus said, Our Lord
has fulfilled the will of his Father, and having
fulfilled it has been taken up to his Father. And
Abgarus said to him, I too have believed in
him and in his Father. And Thaddeus said
to him, Therefore I place my hand upon
thee in his name.
immediately Abgarus was cured of the dis
ease and of the suffering which he had. And
Abgarus marvelled, that as he had heard
concerning Jesus, so he had received in very
deed through his disciple Thaddeus, who healed
him without medicines and herbs, and not only
him, but also Abdus" the son of Abdus, who
was afflicted with the gout ; for he too came to
him and fell at his feet, and having received a
benediction by the imposition of his hands, he
was healed.
The same Thaddeus cured also
many other inhabitants of the city, and did
wonders and marvelous works, and preached

Rinck thinks it probable that Eusebius
or the translator made a mistake, confusing the Syrian name Pota
grus with the Greek word Točaypa, "a sort of gout," and then in:
serting a second Abdas. The word "Podagra" is Greek and could
not have occurred in the Armenian original, and therefore Eusebius
is to be corrected at this point by Moses Chorenensis (Rinck, word.
p. 18). The Greek reads ABôow rov too `ABôov močaypaw oxovra.

addition to these things, I pray thee to inform
me in regard to the coming of Jesus, how he
was born ; and in regard to his power, by what
power he performed those deeds of which
I have heard. And Thaddeus said, Now
indeed will I keep silence, since I have
been sent to proclaim the word publicly.
But
to-morrow assemble for me all thy citizens, and
I will preach in their presence and sow among
them the word of God, concerning the coming
of Jesus, how he was born ; and concerning his
mission, for what purpose he was sent by the
Father; and concerning the power of his works,
and the mysteries which he proclaimed in the
world, and by what power he did these things;
and concerning his new preaching, and his
abasement and humiliation, and how he hum
bled himself, and died and debased his divinity
and was crucified, and descended into Hades,"

" This is probably the earliest distinct and formal statement of
the descent into Hades; but no special stress is laid upon it as a
new doctrine, and it is stated so much as a matter of course as to
show that it was commonly accepted at Edessa at the time of the
writing of these records, that is certainly as early as the third cen
tury.
Justin, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian,
&c., all witness to the belies of the Church in this doctrine, though
it did not form an article in any of the older creeds, and appeared in
the East first in certain Arian confessions at about 360 A.D.
In the
West it appeared first in the Aquileian creed, from which it was
transferred to the Apostles' creed in the fifth century or later.

The doctrine is stated in a very fantastic, shape, in the Gossel of
Micodemus, part II.
(21 nte-Mireme Fathers, Am. ed. VIII. p.
435 sq.), which is based upon, an apocryphal, gospel of the second
century, according to Tischendors.
In it the descent of Christ into
Hades and his ascent with a great multitude are dwelt upon at
length. Compare Pearson, On the Creed, p. 340 sq.; Schafi's

* According to the Chronic/r of Eusebius (ed. Schoene, II.
p. 116) the Edessenes dated their era from the year of Abraham
1705 (h.c. 3ro), which corresponded with the second year of the one
hundred and seventeenth Olympiad (or, according to the Armenian,
to the third year of the same Olympiad), the time when Seleucus Ni
canor began to rule in Syria. Xo, to this reckoning the 34oth
year of the Edessenes would correspond with the year of Abraham
2046, the reign of Tiberius 16 (A.D. 30); that is, the second year of the
two hundred and second Olympiad (or, according to the Armenian,
the third year of the same). According to the Chronicle of Eusebius,

am 2048 = A.D. 32), according to Jerome's version in the eighteenth
year (year of Abraham 2047 = A.D. 31). Thus, as compared with
these authorities, the 34oth year of the Edessenes falls too early.
But Tertullian, Lactantius, Augustine, and others put Christ's death
in 783 U.c., that is in 30 A.D., and this corresponds with the Edessene
reckoning as given by Eusebius.

BOOK II.

INTRODUCTION.

WE have discussed in the

preceding
book those subjects in ecclesiastical history
which it was necessary to treat by way of intro
duction, and have accompanied them with
brief proofs.
Such were the divinity of the
saving Word, and the antiquity of the doctrines
which we teach, as well as of that evangelical
life which is led by Christians, together with
the events which have taken place in connection
with Christ's recent appearance, and in con
nection with his passion and with the choice
of the apostles.
In the present book let
us examine the events which took place
after his ascension, confirming some of them
from the divine Scriptures, and others from
such writings as we shall refer to from time
to time.

* Bk. I. chap. 12, § 2.

* See Acts i. 23-26.
** The view that the Seven were deacons appears first in Ire
natus (adv. Haer. I. 26. 3; III. 12. Io; IV. 15. 1), then in Cyprian
(A.A. 64; 3), and was the commonly accepted opinion of the Roman
Church in the third century (for, while they had forty-six presbyters,
they had only seven deacons; see below, Bk. VI. chap. #. and has
been ever since almost universally accepted.
In favor of the identi
fication are urged this early and unanimous tradition, the similarity
of the duties assigned to the Seven and to later deacons, and the
use of the words 6takovia and 8taxoves v in connection with the
"Seven " in Acts vi.
It must be remarked, however, that ancient
tradition is not unanimously in favor of the identification, for Chrys
ostoni {{..."; A / I'. on Acts) denies it; still further, the func
tions of the Seven and of later deacons were not identical, for the
former were put in charge of the financial affairs of the Jerusalem
church, while the latter acted simply as bishops' assistants.
In fact,
it was the bishop of the second century, not the deacon, that had
charge of the church finances. And finally, no weight can be laid
upon the use of the terms 6-axove v and 6taxovia in connection with
the Seven, for these words are used always in a general, never
in an official sense in other parts of the Acts and of the New
Testament, and, what is still more decisive, the same word (8taxovia)
is used in the same passage in connection with the apostles; the
Seven are "to serve tables" (8tax ovel v Tats roam coats), the apos
tles are to give themselves to "the service of the word " (6ta
sovia rod Aoyov).
There is just as much reason, therefore, on
linguistic grounds, for calling the apostles "deacons" as for giv
ing that name to the Seven. On the other hand, against the opinion
that the Seven were deacons, are to be urged the facts that they
are never called "deacons" by Luke or by any other New Tes
tament writer; that we are nowhere told, in the New Testament
or out of it, that there were deacons in the Jerusalem church,

the congregation, by prayer and the laying on
of the hands of the apostles, approved men,
although . Luke had many opportunities to call the Seven "dea
cons" if he had considered them such; and finally, that according
to Epiphanius (Haer. XXX. 18), the Ebionitic churches of Pales.
tinc in his time had only presbyters and Archisynagogi (chios, cy
the synagogue). . These Ebionites were the Jewish Christian reac
tionaries who refused to advance with the Church catholic in its
normal development; it is therefore at least significant that there
were no deacons among them in the fourth century.
In view of these considerations I feel compelled to doubt the tradi.
tional identification, although it is accepted without dissent by almost
all scholars (cf. e.g. Lightfoot's article on The Christian J/inistry
in his Commentary on Philippians). There remain but two possi.
bilities: either the Seven constituted a merely temporary commit
... W. by Chrysostom, and in modern times, among others,
by Vitringa, in his celebrated work on the Synagogue, and by Stan.
ley in his Essays on the 2-1/gstolic Age); or they were the origi
nals of permanent officers in the Church, other than deacons. The
former alternative is possible, but the emphasis which Luke lays
upon the appointment is against it, as also the fact that the very dutics
which these men were chosen to perform were such as would in
crease rather than diminish with the growth of the Church, and such
as would therefore demand the creation of a new and similar com
mittee if the old were not continued.

In favor of the second alternative there is, it seems to me, much
to be said. The limits of this note forbid a full discussion of the sub
ject. . But it may be urged: . First, that we find in the Acts frequent
mention of a body of men in the Jerusalem church known as "elders."
Of the appointment of these elders we have no account, and yet
it is clear that they cannot have been in existence when the apostics
proposed the appointment of the Seven.
Secondly, although the
Seven were such prominent and influential men, they are not
once mentioned as a body in the subsequent chapters of the Acts,
while, whenever we shoi expect to find them referred to with the
apostles, it is always the " ..., " that are mentioned.
Finally,
when the elders appear for the first time (Acts xi. 30), we find
them entrusted with the same duties, which the Seven were origi
nally appointed to perform: they receive the alms sent by the church
of Antioch.
It is certainly, to say the least, a very natural conclu
sion that these "elders" occupy the office of whose institution we
read in Acts vi.

Against this identification of the Seven with the elders of the
First, that Luke does not
Jerusalem church it might be urged:
call them elders.
But it is quite possible that they were not called
by that name at first, and yet later acquired it; and in that case, in
referring to them in later times, people would naturally call the first
appointed "the Seven," to distinguish them from their successors,
''. elders,"- the well-known and frequently mentioned officers
whose number may well have been increased as the church grew.
It is thus easier to account for Luke's omission of the name "clier,"
than it would be to account for his omission of the name "deacon,"
if they were deacons.
In the second place, it might be objected that
the duties which the Seven were appointed to perform were not
commensurate with those which fell to the lot of the elders as
known to us. This objection, however, loses its weight when we real
ize that the same kind of a development went on in connection with
the bishop, as has been most clearly pointed out by Hatch in his O,--
anization of the Early Christian Chiarches, and by Harnack in
is translation of that work and in his edition of the Teaching of the
.4/ostles.
Moreover, in the case of the Seven, who were evi
dently the chiefest men in the lo." church, after the apostles,
and at the same time were "full of the Spirit," it was very natural
that, as the apostles gradually scattered, the successors of these
Seven should have co to them other duties besides the
purely financial ones.
It was
suggested first § Böhmer (in his /) iss. Juri's eccles.), who was
followed by Ritschl (in his Entste/, ung der alt-Kath. A orche),
and has been accepted in a somewhat modified form by Lange (in
his A fosto/isches Zeitaster), and by Lechler (in his AAost. , traf
-Vacha fost. Zeitaster).
Before learning that the theory had been
proposed by others, I had myself adopted it and had embodied it in
a more elaborate form in a paper read before a ministerial associa
tion in the spring of 1888. My confidence in its validity has of
course been increased by the knowledge that it has been maintained
by the eminent scholars referred to above.

i. theory presented in this note is not a novel one.

seven in number, of whom Stephen was one."
He first, after the Lord, was stoned to death at
the time of his ordination by the slayers of the
Lord, as if he had been promoted for this very
purpose." And thus he was the first to receive
the crown, corresponding to his name," which
belongs to the martyrs of Christ, who are
worthy of the meed of victory. Then James,
whom the ancients surnamed the Just"
on account of the excellence of his virtue, is
recorded to have been the first to be made
bishop of the church of Jerusalem.
This James
was called the brother of the Lord' because he
was known as a son of Joseph," and Joseph was
supposed to be the father of Christ, because the
Virgin, being betrothed to him, "was found with
child by the Holy Ghost before they came
together," as the account of the holy
Gospels shows.
But Clement in the sixth
book of his Hypotyposes" writes thus:
"For they say that Peter and James and John
after the ascension of our Saviour, as if also
preferred by our Lord, strove not after honor,
but chose James the Just bishop of Jeru
salem.""
the
seventh book of the same work, relates
also the following things concerning him : "The
Lord after his resurrection imparted knowledge
to James the Just and to John and Peter, and
they imparted it to the rest of the apostles, and
the rest of the apostles to the seventy, of whom
Barnabas was one."

thus by all from the time of Christ, on account of his great picty,
and it is by this name that he is known throughout history.

Laemmer, followed
by Heinichen, substitutes ye verbal for Aegoat on the authority of
two important codices. The other reading, however, is as well, if
not better, supported.

How soon after the ascension of Christ, James the Just assumed
a leading position in the church of Jerusalem, we do not know.
He undoubtedly became prominent very soon, as Paul in 37 (or
40) A.D. sees him in addition to Peter on visiting Jerusalem.
But
we do not know of his having a position of leadership until the
Jerusalem Council in 51 (Acts, xv. and Gal. ii.), where he is one
of the three pillars, standing at least upon an equality in influence
But this very expression "three pillars of

the Church " excludes the supposition that he was bishop of the
Church in the modern sense of the term - he was only one of the
rulers of the Church.
Indeed, we have abundant cvidence from
other sources that the monarchical episcopacy was nowhere known
at that o age.
It was the custom of all writers of the second
century and later to throw back into the apostolic age their own
church organization, and hence we hear of bishops appointed by
the apostles in various churches where we know that the episco
pacy was a second century growth.

* See above, Bk. I. chap. 12, note 3.
* Clement evidently identifies James, the brother of the Lord,
with James, the son of Alphaeus (compare the words just above:
"These delivered it to the rest of the apostles," in which the word
"apostles," on account of the "Seventy '' just following, seems to
be used in a narrow sense, and therefore this James to be one of the
Twelve), and he is thus cited as a witness to the cousin hypothesis

writes, "Other of the apostles saw I none,
save James the Lord's brother." ". At that
time also the promise of our Saviour to

Thomas, under a divine impulse, sent Thaddeus
to Edessa as a preacher and evangelist of the
religion of Christ, as we have shown a little
above from the document found there."
When he came to that place he healed
Abgarus by the word of Christ; and after
bringing all the people there into the right
attitude of mind by means of his works, and
leading them to adore the power of Christ, he
made them disciples of the Saviour's teaching.
And from that time down to the present the
whole city of the Edessenes has been devoted
to the name of Christ," offering no common
proof of the beneficence of our Saviour
toward them also.
These things have
been drawn from ancient accounts; but
let us now turn again to the divine Scripture.
When the first and greatest persecution was
instigated by the Jews against the church of
Jerusalem in connection with the martyrdom of
Stephen, and when all the disciples, except the
Twelve, were scattered throughout Judea and
Samaria," some, as the divine Scripture says,
went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch,
but could not yet venture to impart the word
therefore
of faith
preached it to the Jews alone."
During
this time Paul was still persecuting the
church, and entering the houses of believers
was dragging men and women away and
Philip also,
committing them to prison."
one of those who with Stephen had been
entrusted with
diaconate, being among
those who were scattered abroad, went down
to Samaria," and being filled with the divine
power, he first preached the word to the in
habitants of that country.

James the Just to distinguish him from others.
Eusebius quotes
this passage of Clement with apparently no suspicion that it con
tradicts his own opinion in regard to the relationship of James to
Christ.
The contradiction, indeed, appears only upon careful
examination.

According to the

5 Eusebius here utters the universal belief of the early Church,
which from the subsequent career of Simon, who was considered the
founder of all heresies, and the great arch-heretic himself, read back
into his very conversion the hypocrisy for which he was afterward
distinguished in Church history. The account of the Acts does not
say that his belief was hypocritical, and leaves it to be implied (if it
be implied at all) only from his subsequent conduct in endeavoring
to purchase the gift of God with money.

* Eusebius may refer here to the Simonians, an heretical scot
(mentioned by Justin, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and others),
which recognized him as its founder and leader (though they origi
nated probably at a later date), and even looked upon him as a God.
They were exceedingly licentious and immoral.
Their teachings
gradually assumed a decidedly Gnostic character, and Simon came
to be looked upon as the father of all Gnostics (compare I renaeus,
I. 27.4); and hence of heretics in general, and as himself the arch
heretic.
Eusebius, therefore, perhaps refers in this place simply to
the Gnostics, or to the heretics in general.

* Another instance of the external and artificial conception of

heresy which Eusebius held in common with his age.

* Acts viii. tells of no punishment which befell Simon further
than the rebuke of Peter which Hippolytus (Phil. vi. 15) calls a
curse, and which as such may have been regarded by Eusebius as a
deserved punishment, its effect clinging to him, and finally bringing
him to destruction (see below, chap. 14, note 8).

Christianity into Ethiopia is in the fourth century, under Frumen

and yet it is probable that Christianity existed there long before this
time. Compare Neander's A orchengesch ichte, I. p. 46.

Justin Mar

known in his i. but the so-called Acts of Polate which are still
extant in various forms are spurious, and belong to a much later
period. They are very sanciful and curious. The most important
of these Acts is that Wol. is commonly known under the title of the
Gospel of Vorod'em us.
There are also extant numerous spurious
cpistles of Pilate addressed to Herod, to Tiberius, to Claudius, &c.

But although the Senate of the Romans
rejected the proposition made in regard to
our Saviour, Tiberius still retained the opinion
which he had held at first, and contrived

* That Tiberius did not persecute the Christians is a fact; but
this was simply because they attracted no notice during his reign,
and not because of his respect for them or of his belief in Christ.

* Tertullian was born in Carthage about the middle of the second
century. The common opinion is that he was born about 16o, but
Lipsius pushes the date back toward the beginning of the fifties, and
some even into the forties.
For a recent study of the subject, see
Ernst Nöldechen in the Zeitschrist for wissenschaftliche Theol.
ogie, 1886, Heft 2. He concludes that he was born about 150 and
lived until about 230.
Tertullian's father was a Roman centurion,
and he himself became a lawyer and rhetorician in Rome. He was
converted to Christianity probably between 180 and 190, and accord
ing to Jerome, became a presbyter and continued as such until
middle life (whether in Rome or in Carthage we cannot tell; prob
ably in the latter, for he certainly spent the later years of his life,
while he was a Montanist, in Carthage, and also a considerable part
of his earlier life, as his writings indicatc), when he went over to
Montanism (probably about zoo A.D.), and died at an advanced age
(220 ). That he was a presbyter rests only upon the authority of
Jerome (de zor. Fol. 53), and is denied by some Roman Catholic
historians in the interest of clerical celibacy, for Tertullian was a
married man. He wrote a great number of works,- apologetic,
polemic, and practical - a few in Greek, but most of them in Latin,
- and many of the Latin ones are still extant. The best colition of
them is by Qehler, Leipzig, 1853, in three volumes. Vol. III. con
tains valuable dissertations upon the life and works of Tertullian by
various writers. An English translation of his works is given in
the .4 mte-Vicenc Fathers, Vols. III. and IV. 1-125. Our main
sources for a knowledge of his life are his own writings, and Jerome's
de zor. tol. chap. 53.

* Tertullian's - Aology ranks first among his extant works, and
is "one of the most beautiful monuments of the heroic age of the
Church'' (Schaff). The date of its composition is greatly disputed,
though it must have been written during the reign of Septimius
Severus, and almost all scholars are agreed in assigning it to the
years 197-204. Since the investigations of Bonwetsch (19te Schristen
Tortolian's, Bonn, 1878), of Harnack (in the Zeitschrift für
Kirchengeschächte, 1878, p. 572 sqq.), and of Nöldechen (in Geb
hardt and Harnack's Terte und. Unters tech to rosen, 13.and V. Heft 2),
all of whom agree in assigning its composition to the latter part
(summer or fall) of the year 197, its date may be accepted as prac
tically established.

* Some have contended that Eusebius himself translated this pas
sage from Tertullian, but his words, show clearly enough that he
quotes from an already existing translation.
His knowledge of the
Latin language appears to have been very limited. He must have
had some acquaintance with it, for he translates Hadrian's rescript

lows: ""But in order that we may give an
account of these laws from their origin, it
was an ancient decree" that no one should be
consecrated a God by the emperor until the
Senate had expressed its approval.

Aurelius did thus concerning a certain idol, Al

Thus,
according to this custom, it is necessary for
man to be gracious to God.
Tiberius,
therefore, under whom the name of Christ
made its entry into the world, when this doc
trine was reported to him from Palestine, where
it first began, communicated with the Senate,
making it clear to them that he was pleased
with the doctrine." But the Senate, since it had
not itself proved the matter, rejected it.

Tiberius continued to hold his own opinion, and
threatened death to the accusers of the Chris

would not require a profound knowledge of the language, and there

minds, in consequence of errors which had de

through the teaching and the wonderful works of
his disciples, set free, as it were, from terrible
masters, and found a release from the most cruel
bondage. They renounced with abhorrence every
species of demoniacal polytheism, and confessed
that there was only one God, the creator of all
things, and him they honored with the rites of true
piety, through the inspired and rational worship

statement is not a mere rhetorical flourish; it was believed as a his

This conception arose originally out of the idea that
the second coming of Christ was near, and the whole world must
know of him before his coming. The tradition that the apostles
preached in all parts of the world is to be traced back to the same
cause.

But the
internal evidence seems to demand "EAAnvas, and this reading is
found in some of the oldest versions and in a few MSS., and is
adopted by most modern critics, including Tischendors.
Eusebius
is a witness for the latter reading. He takes the word "EAAmvas in

one other passage of the Acts (xxi. 10, where he foretells the impris

of Claudius, where Eusebius puts it when he mentions it again in
chap. 8. He cannot therefore be accused, as many accuse him, of
putting the famine itself into the reign of Tiberius, and hence of
committing a chronological error. He is following the account of
the Acts, and mentions the prominent fact of the famine in that
connection, without thinking of chronological order.
His method
is, to be sure, loose, as he does not inform his readers that he is
anticipating by a number of years, but leaves them to discover it for
themselves when they find o: same subject taken up again after a

After the death of Caius, his successor, Claudius, appointed

after this. He is mentioned by Jerome (de for. o. 11), who says

this, and there is probably no truth in the statement. He is men

books, of the misfortunes of the Jews under

and performed as emperor innumerable acts of
tyranny ; and he describes further the miseries

Eusebius cites what seems

confirmed by the fact that Eusebius (in chap. 18) mentions the
work under the title On the lortues, which he says that Philo

of the Jews during the time of Tiberius, by Sejanus in Rome, and
by Pilate in Judea (see below, note 9); Hook III., 4 doers us /orc
cum (still extant), contains an account of the persecution of the
Jews of Alexandria at the beginning of the reign of Caius; Book IV.,
Legatio ad Cajúm (still extant), describes the sufferings which
came upon the Jews as a result of Caius' command that divine
honors should everywhere be paid him; Book V., the to Alvosia
(which is lost), contained an account of the change for the better in
the Jews' condition through the death of Caius, and the cdict of tol
eration published by Claudius. Upon the other works of Philo, see
chap. 18, below.
* The occasion of this embassy was a terrible disturbance which
had arisen between the |. and Greeks in Alexandria, and had
continued with occasional interruptions for more than a year. Much
blood had been shed, and affairs were becoming constantly worse.
All cfforts to secure peace utterly sailed, and finally, in 4o A.D., the
Greeks dispatched an embassy to the emperor, hoping to secure
from him an edict for the cvtcrimination of the Jews. The Jews, on

Caius in behalf of the laws of his fathers he re
ceived nothing but laughter and ridicule, and
Josealmost incurred the risk of his life.
phus also makes mention of these things in
the eighteenth book of his Antiquities, in the
following words:* "A sedition having arisen in
Alexandria between the Jews that dwell there
and the Greeks," three deputies were chosen
from each faction and went to Caius. One
of the Alexandrian deputies was Apion,"
who uttered many slanders against the Jews;

subjects of Rome erected altars and temples to
Caius, and in all other respects treated him just
as they did the gods, they alone considered it
disgraceful to honor him with statues and
to swear by his name. And when Apion
had uttered many severe charges by which
he hoped that Caius would be aroused, as indeed
was likely, Philo, the chief of the Jewish em
bassy, a man celebrated in every respect, a
brother of Alexander the Alabarch," and not
unskilled in philosophy, was prepared to enter

their side, followed the example of the Greeks, sending an embassy
for their own defense, with Philo at its head. The result was as
Eusebius relates, and the Jews were left in a worse condition than
before, from which, however, they were speedily relieved by the
death of Caius.
Claudius, who succeeded Caius, restored to them
for a time, religious freedom and all the rights which they had
hitherto enjoyed.

: Josephus, Ant. XVIII. 8.1.
* This sedition, mentioned above, began in 38 A.D., soon after
the accession of Caius. The Jews, since the time of Alexander the
Great, when they had come in great numbers to the newly founded
city, Alexandria, had enjoyed with occasional interruptions high
favor there, and were among the most influential inhabitants. They
possessed all the rights of citizenship and stood upon an equality
with their neighbors in all respects. When Alexandria fell into the
hands of the i." all the inhabitants, Jews as well as Greeks,
were compelled to take a position subordinate to the conquerors, but
their condition was not worse than that of their neighbors. They
had always, however, been hated more or less by their fellow-citizens
on account of their prosperity, which was the result of superior edu
cation and industry. This enmity came to a crisis under Caius, when
the financial condition of Egypt was very bad, and the inhabitants
felt themselves unusually burdened by the Roman demands. The
old hatred for their more prosperous neighbors broke out afresh, and
the terrible disturbance mentioned was the result. The refusal of
the Jews to worship Caius as a God was made a pretext for attacking
them, and it was this refusal which gained for them the hatred of
Caius himself.

* Apion, chief of the Greek deputies, was a grammarian of Alex
andria who had won great same as a writer and Greek scholar. He
seems to have been very unscrupulous and profligate, and was a
bitter and persistent enemy of the Jews, whom he attacked very sc
verely in at least two of his works - the Egyptian History and a
special work Against the ories, neither of which is extant. He
was very unscrupulous in his attacks, inventing the most absurd
and malicious falsehoods, which were quite generally believed, and
were the means of spreading still more widely the common hatred of
the Jews.
Against him Josephus wrote his celebrated work, Contra
. Arozierz (more fully de a motion state 7 to daeorum contra A/oronema),
which is still extant, and in the second book of which he exposes the
ignorance and mendacity of Apion.
In the Pseudo-Clementines he
plays an important (but of course fictitious) role as an antagonist of
the Gospel. The extant fragments of Apion's works are given, ac
cording to Lightfoot, in Müller's Fraomy. A fist. Graec. II. 506 sq.,
and in Fabricius' Biê'. Graec. I. 503, and VII. 50. Compare Light
foot's article in Smith and Wace's Pict. of Christ. Biog.

* The Alabarch was the chief magistrate of the Jews at Alexan
dria. Alexander was a very rich and influential Jew, who was widely
known and held in high esteem.
His son Tiberius Alexander was
appointed procurator of Judea in 46 A.D., as successor of Cuspius
Fadus.
Philo thus belonged to a high and noble Jewish family.
The accuracy of Josephus' statement that Philo was the brother of
the Alabarch Alexander has been denied (e.g., by Fwald, Gesch. does
7 is dischen I'olkes, Vol. VI. p. 235), and the Aï. has been as
sumned to have been the nephew of Philo, but this without sufficient
ground (compare Schürer, ióid, p. 832, note 5).

to these the same author records" many

itself, and shows that from that time seditions

crimes which they dared to commit against

It is worthy of note that Pilate himself, who
was governor in the time of our Saviour, is re

originally any offering to God, especially an offering, in fulfillment
of a vow.
The form xopbavas, which Josephus has employed
here, was used to denote the sacred treasure or the treasury itself.
In Matt. xxvii. 6, the only place where this form of the word occurs
in the New Testament, it is used with the latter meaning. Upon
this act of Pilate's, see above, chap. 5, note 9.
1. Josephus, in Ant. XVIII. 3. 2, says that the aqueduct was
200 stadia long.
In the passage which Eusebius quotes the number
given is 4oo, according to the Greek MSS. of Josephus, though the
old Latin translation agrees with Eusebius in reading 3oo. The
situation of the aqueduct we do not know, though the remains of an
ancient ...}. been found to the south of Jerusalem, and it
is thought that this may have been the same.
It is possible that
Pilate did not construct a new aqueduct, but simply restored one

that had been built in the time of Solomon.
Berlin, 1845) suggests the number 40, supposing that the aqueduct
began at Bethlehein, which is 40 stadia from Jerusalem.

* See A. 9. II. Io, 12 sqq.
* Pilate's downfall occurred in the following manner. A leader
of the Samaritans had promised to disclose the sacred treasures which
Moses was reported to have concealed upon Mt. Gerizim, and the
Samaritans came together in great numbers from all quarters. Pilate,
supposing the gathering to be with rebellious purpose, sent troops
against them and defeated them with great slaughter. The Samari
tans complained to Vitellius, governor of Syria, who sent Pilate to
Rome (36 A.D.) to answer the charges brought against him. Upon
reaching Rome he found Tiberius dead and Caius upon the throne.
He was unsuccessful in his attempt to defend himself, and, accord
ing to tradition, was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where a monu
ment is still shown as Pilate's tomb.
According to another tradition
he committed suicide upon the mountain near Lake Lucerne, which

years,' when he was succeeded by the em
peror Claudius.
Under him the world was vis
ited with a famine," which writers that are entire
strangers to our religion have recorded in their
histories." And thus the prediction of Agabus
recorded in the Acts of the Apostles," according
to which the whole world was to be visited
by a famine, received its fulfillment. And
Luke, in the Acts, after mentioning the
famine in the time of Claudius, and stating that
the brethren of Antioch, each according to his
ability, sent to the brethren of Judea by the
hands of Paul and Barnabas," adds the following
aCCOunt.

CHAPTER IX.

The Martyrdom of James the Apostle.

"Now about that time" (it is clear that
he means the time of Claudius) "Herod
the King *stretched forth his hands to vex cer
tain of the Church. And he killed James
the brother of John with the sword." And
concerning this James, Clement, in the sev

" Caius ruled from March 16, A.D. 37, to Jan. 24, A.D. 41, and

was succeeded by his uncle Claudius.

Whether it refers simply to Palestine, or is used to indicate a succes
sion of famines in different parts of the world, or is employed only in
a rhetorical sense, it is impossible to say.
Eusebius understands the
word in its widest sense, and therefore assumes a universal famine;
but he is mistaken in his assumption.

3 The only non-Christian historians, so far as we know, to record
a famine during the reign of Claudius, are Dion Cassius and Tacitus,
who mention a famine in Rome, and Josephus, who speaks of the
sainine in Judea (see the previous note for the references). Euse
bius, in his Chron., mentions famines both in Greece and in Rome
during this reign, but upon what authority we do not know. As
already remarked, we have no extant account of a general famine at
this time.

CHAPTER X.

\

Agrippa, who was also called Herod, having per
secuted the Apostles, immediate/y experienced'
the Divine Vengeance.

THE consequences of the king's under
taking against the apostles were not long
deferred, but the avenging minister of divine
justice overtook him immediately after his plots
against them, as the Book of Acts records.'
For when he had journeyed to Caesarea, on a
notable feast-day, clothed in a splendid and royal
garment, he delivered an address to the people
from a lofty throne in front of the tribunal. And
when all the multitude applauded the speech, as
if it were the voice of a god and not of a man,
the Scripture relates that an angel of the Lord
smote him, and being eaten of worms he
gave up the ghost." We must admire the
account of Josephus for its agreement with
the divine Scriptures in regard to this wonderful
event; for he clearly bears witness to the truth
in the nineteenth book of his Antiquities, where
he relates the wonder in
the following
words:* "He had completed the third
year of his reign over all Judea' when he
came to Caesarea, which was formerly called
There he held games in honor
Strato's Tower."

may have been true, though external testimony for it is, of course,
weak. The Latin iegends concerning James' later labors in Spain
and his burial in Compostella are entirely worthless... Epiphanius
reports that he was unmarried, and lived the life of a Nazarite; but
he gives no authority for his statement, and it is not improbable that
the report originated through a confusion of this James with James
the Just.

* Caesarea lay upon the Mediterranean Sea, northwest of Jerusa

At this
festival was collected a great multitude of the
highest and most honorable men in the prov
ince. And on the second day of the games
he proceeded to the theater at break of
day, wearing a garment entirely of silver and of
wonderful texture. And there the silver, illu
minated by the reflection of the sun's earliest
rays, shone marvelously, gleaming so brightly
as to produce a sort of fear and terror in
those who gazed upon him. And immediately his flatterers, some from one place,
others from another, raised up their voices in a
way that was not for his good, calling him a god,
and saying, ‘Be thou merciful; if up to this
time we have feared thee as a man, henceforth
we confess that thou art superior to the
nature of mortals.' The king did not rebuke them, nor did he reject their impious
flattery.
But after a little, looking up, he saw
an angel sitting above his head.' And this he
quickly perceived would be the cause of evil as

In the time of Strabo there was simply a small town at this

city of Palestine, and was noted for its magnificence.
It became,
later, the seat of an important Christian school, and played quite a
art in Church history.
Eusebius himself was Bishop of Caesarea.
t was a city of importance, even in the time of the crusades, but is
now a scene of utter desolation.

" The occasion of this festival is uncertain. Some have consid
ered it the festival in honor of the birth of Claudius; others, a festi
val in honor of the return of Claudius from Britain.
But neither of
these suggestions is likely.
It is more probable that the festival
mentioned was the Quinouemma'fa, instituted by Herod the Great
in honor of Augustus in 12 B.C. (see Josephus, Ant. XV. 8. 1; B. 9.
I. 21.8), and celebrated regularly every five years.
See Wieseler's
Chronologie des ago. Zeita/ters, p. 131 sqq., where this question is
carefully discussed in connection with the date of Agrippa's death,
which is fixed by Wieseler as Aug. 6, 44 A.D.

* The passage in Josephus reads: "But as he presently after
ward looked up he saw an owl sitting on a certain rope over his head,
and immediately understood that this bird was the messenger of evil
tidings, as it had once been the messenger of good tidings to him."
This conveys an entirely different sense, the owl being omitted in
Eusebius. As a consequence most writers on Eusebius have made
the gravest charges against him, accusing him of a willful perversion
of the text of Josephus with the intention of producing a confirmation
of the narrative .#. Acts, in which the angel of God is spoken of,
but in which no mention is made of an owl. The case certainly looks
serious, but so severe an accusation - an accusation which impeaches
the honesty of Eusebius in the most direct manner - should not
be made except upon unanswerable grounds.
Eusebius elsewhere
shows himself to be a writer who, though not always critical, is at
least honest in the use he makes of his materials.
In this case,
therefore, his general conduct ought to be taken into consideration,
and he ought to be given the benefit of the doubt.
Lightfoot, who
defends his honesty, gives an explanation which appears to me suf
ficiently satisfactory. He says: "Doubtless also the omission of
the ...} in the account of joid Agrippa's death was already in
some texts of Josephus. The manner in which Eusebius deals with
his very numerous quotations elsewhere, where we can test his hon
esty, is a sufficient vindication against this unjust charge." And in
a note he adds: "It is not the substitution of an angel for an owl
as the case is not uncommonly stated. The o is produced
mainly by the omission of some words in the text of Josephus, which
runs thus: ávaxvilas 6 ovy uer' baiyov [Tov Boubova) tos tavrov
kebaans insep Rabeçöuevow eiðev [&mi oxolviov ruvos] ayye Adv [re]

that the change (by whomsoever made) was dictated by any disin
genuous motive. A scribe unacquainted with Latin would stumble
over row Bovbova, which had a wholly different meaning and seems
never to have been used of an owl in ë. and he would alter the
text in order to extract some sense out of it.

die.

never seen that explanation.

Whiston in his translation of Josephus inserts a note to the sol
lowing effect: "We have a mighty cry made here by some writers,
as if the great Eusebius had on purpose falsified this account of
Josephus, so as to make it agree with the parallel account in the

that owl, which Josephus called "an angel or messenger, §oy of

somewhat strange one in the case of the great Eusebius, who is

Now, not to
allege how uncertain we are, whether Josephus' and Eusebius'
copies of the fourth century were just like the present in this clause,
which we have no distinct evidence of, the following words preserved
still in Eusebius will not admit of any such exposition. ‘This

of ill fortune, as it was once of good fortune'; which can belong
only to that bird the ‘owl, which, as it had formerly foreboded his

Theudas which has caused much dispute. The Theudas mentioned
by Josephus arose in the time of Claudius; but the Theudas referred
to by Gamaliel in the Acts must have lived many years before that.
Various solutions of greater or less plausibility have been offered,
almost any one of which is possible, and abundantly sufficient to
account for the alleged discrepancy, though none can be proved to
be true. Compare Wieseler's Chron. des ap; Zostalters, p. 138,

sciously to involve himself in such a glaring anachronism - an anach

The only reasonable explanation of Eusebius' anachronism is his
carelessness, which caused him to fall into many blunders as bad as
the present, especially in questions of chronology. He read, in the
Acts, of Theudas; he read, in Josephus, of a similar character of the
same name; he identified the two hastily, and without a thought of
any chronological difficulty in the case. He quotes the passage from
the Acts very freely, and possibly without recollecting that it occurs
several chapters before the account of the samine and of the other
events which happened in the time of Claudius.

'. It is justly remarked by Reuterdahl that no chapters of Euse
bius' History are so imperfect and unsatisfactory as those which re
late to heresies, but that this is to be ascribed more to the age than to
the author. . A right understanding of heresies and an appreciation
of any, truth which they might contain was, utterly impossible to
men who looked upon heresy as the work of the devil, and all here
tics as his chosen tools.
Eusebius has been condemned by some,
because he gives his information about heretics only from second
hand, and quotes none of them directly; but it must be remembered
that this method was by no means peculiar to Eusebius, and, more
over, it is highly probable that he did not have access to any of their
works. The accounts of the heretics given by Irenaeus, Hippolytus,
and others would of course be preserved, but the writings of heretics
themselves would be piously excluded as completely as possible from
all Christian libraries, and the knowledge of them cannot have re
mained long in the Church. The sources upon which we have to
rely at the present day for a knowledge of these heresies furnish an
illustration of this. We know them almost solely through their ene
mies, and Eusebius knew them in the same way and very likely for
the same reason.

Simon rests upon a very slender foundation, as many passages can
be adduced in which the two are expressly distinguished, and indeed
the thought of identifying Paul and Simon seems never to have
occurred to the writer of the Recognitions. The most that can be
said is that the author of the Homilies gives, and without doubt
purposely, some Pauline traits to his picture of Simon, but this does
not imply that he makes Simon no more than a mask for Paul (cf.
the words of Salmon in his article, Clementine Literature, in the

real historic person whose actual existence must be assumed to
account for the early notices of him in the Acts and in Justin Martyr,
as well as the common tradition of him among all parties in the
Church. Salmon considers Simon of Gitton - the basis of the ac
count of Justin Martyr and of all the later Simon legends - a second
century Gnostic distinct from the Simon mentioned in the Acts (see
his excellent article Simon Magus, in the 19tet. of Christ. Breg. IV.

In the Pseudo-Clementines Simon is represented as

refutes him repeatedly in public disputations, until, at length one

to Antonine in behalf of our religion writes
as follows: " "And after the ascension of
the Lord into heaven the demons put for
ward certain men who said they were gods,
and who were not only allowed by you to go
unpersecuted, but were even deemed worthy of
honors. One of them was Simon, a Samaritan
of the village of Gitto," who in the reign of
Claudius Caesar" performed in your imperial
city some mighty acts of magic by the art of
demons operating in him, and was considered
a god, and as a god was honored by you with a
statue, which was erected in the river Tiber," be
tween the two bridges, and bore this inscription in
the Latin tongue, Simoni Deo Sancto, that
is, To Simon the Holy God." And nearly
all the Samaritans and a few even of other
nations confess and worship him as the first
God. And there went around with him at that
time a certain Helena" who had formerly been
a prostitute in Tyre of Phoenicia; and her they
call the first idea that proceeded from him."

* On Justin's Apology, see below, Bk. IV. chap. 18, note 2.

* Gitton was a §: of Samaria, near Flavia Neapolis (the mod

Simon, of about the same date, who was born in Cyprus. There
was a town called Kirtov in Cyprus, and it has been thought that
Justin may have mistaken this place for the Samaritan Gitton.
But
even if we assume the identity of the two Simons, as many critics do,
it is less likely that Justin, a native of Samaria, was mistaken upon
a question concerning his own country, than that Josephus was.
Simon's activity o have extended to Cyprus, in which case Jo
sephus might easily have mistaken his birthplace.

* Justin here assigns Simon's visit to Rome to the reign of
Claudius (41-54 A.D.), as Irenaeus also does. Other accounts as
sign it to the reign of Nero, but all differ as to the detail
of his
death; suicide, death from injuries received while trying to fly, vol
untary burial in expectation of rising again on the third day, &c.,
are reported in different traditions.
All, however, agree that he
visited Rome at some time or another.

short distance below the Vatican, and which now bears the name
Asola Tiberiana, or di S. Sebastiano.

" In 1574 a statue, bearing the inscription Semon: Samco deo
sidio, &c., was found in the place described by Justin Martyr, but
this statue was erected to the Sabine divinity Semo Sancus.
It is
therefore highly probable that Justin mistook this statue for a statue
of Simon Magus. This is now the commonly accepted view, though
the translator of Justin Martyr in the Ante-Micene Fathers ven
tures to dispute it (see the Am. ed. Vol. I. p. 171, note). The report
is given a second time by Justin in his Apol. 56, and also by Ire

This thorough misunderstanding of the nature and aim of Gnosticism
has been perpetuated in our day by many writers upon the subject.
Neander was the first to attempt a thoroughly philosophical treat

Lightfoot, Salmon, and especially Harnack, who has grasped the
true principle of Gnosticism perhaps more fully than any one else.

licentious, and of some other Gnostic sects, as e.g. the Ophites, the

THE evil power," who hates all that is
good and plots against the salvation of men,
constituted Simon at that time the father and
author of such wickedness," as if to make him a
mighty antagonist of the great, inspired
apostles of our Saviour.
For that divine
and celestial grace which co-operates with
its ministers, by their appearance and presence,
quickly extinguished the kindled flame of evil,
and humbled and cast down through them "every
high thing that exalted itself against the
knowledge of God." Wherefore neither
the conspiracy of Simon nor that of any of
the others who arose at that period could ac
complish anything in those apostolic times. For
everything was conquered and subdued by the
splendors of the truth and by the divine word
itself which had but lately begun to shine from
heaven upon men, and which was then flourish
ing upon earth, and dwelling in the apos
ties themselves.
Immediately "the above

of his mind by a divine and miraculous flash,
and after the evil deeds done by him had been
first detected by the apostle Peter in Judea,"
he fled and made a great journey across the sea
from the East to the West, thinking that only
thus could he live according to his mind.
And coming to the city of Rome," by the
mighty co-operation of that power which
was lying in wait there, he was in a short time
so successful in his undertaking that those who
dwelt there honored him as a god by the

I am tempted to think that
Eusebius may have been using at this point some unknown source,
and that the word "immediately" refers to an encounter which
Simon had had with Peter (perhaps his Caesarean discussion, men
tioned in the Clementines), of which an account was given in the
ument employed by Eusebius. The figure employed here is

most remarkable.

to indicate the Roman province of Judea, which included also Sama

a written source, that some other encounter of Simon and Peter is
referred to.
Such a one e.g. as is mentioned in the Apostolic Con
stitutions, WI. 8.

Although we may accept it as certain that he did
visit Rome, and that he met his death there, it is no less certain that
he did not reach there until late in the reign of Nero. The tradition
that he was for twenty-five years bishop of Rome is first recorded by
Jerome (de zir. 1/7. c. 1), and since his time has been almost uni
versally accepted in the Roman Catholic Church, though in recent
years many more candid scholars of that communion acknowledge
that so long an episcopate there is a fiction. The tradition undoubt

previous chapter) that Simon Magus came to Rome during the reign

nected the Roman visits of Simon and of Peter; and consequently
Eusebius, accepting the earlier date for Simon's arrival in Rome,
quite naturally assumed also the same date for Peter's arrival there,
although Justin does not mention Peter in connection with Simon in
the passage which Eusebius quotes. The assumption that Peter
took up his residence in Rome during the reign of Claudius contra
dicts all that we know of Peter's later life from the New Testament
and from other early writers. . In 44 A.D. he was in Jerusalem (ac
cording to Acts xii. 3); in 51 he was again there (according to Acts
xy.); and a little later in Antioch (according to Gal. i. 11 sq.).
Moreover, at some time during his life he labored in various prov
inces in Asia Minor, as we learn from his first epistle, and probably
wrote that epistle from Babylon on the Euphrates (see chap. 15, note
7). At any rate, he cannot have been in Rome when Paul wrote his
epistle to the Romans (57 or 58 A.D.), for no mention is made of
him among the brethren to whom greetings are sent. Nor can he
have been there when Paul wrote #. Rome during his captivity
(61 or 62 to 63 or 64 A.D.). We have, in fact, no trace of him in
Rome, except the extra-Biblical but well-founded tradition (see chap.
25, note 7) that he met his death there. We may assume, then, that
he did not reach Rome at any rate until shortly before his death;
that is, shortly before the summer of 64 A.D. As most of the ac
counts put Simon Magus' visit to Rome in the reign of Nero (see
above, chap. 13, note 9), so they make him follow Peter thither
(as he had Élso him everywhere, opposing and attacking him),
instead of precede him, as Eusebius does.
Eusebius follows Justin
in giving the earlier date for Simon's visit to Rome; but he goes
beyond Justin in recording his encounter there with Peter, which
neither Justin nor Irenaeus mentions. The earlier date for Simon's
visit is undoubtedly that given by the oldest tradition.
Afterward,
when Peter and Paul were so prominently connected with the reign
of Nero, the visit of Simon was postponed to synchronize with the
presence of the two apostles in Rome. A report of Simon's meeting
with Peter in Rome is given first by Hippolytus (VI. 15); afterward
by Arnobius (II. 12), who does not describe the meeting; by the
AA. Const., the Clementine A'ecognitions and //omo/ies, and the

Neither Justin, Ire

the AAA. Const, give too much, as they give accounts of his death,
which Eusebius does not follow. As to this, it might, however, be

did not read, and the Clementines were probably too late for him;
at any rate, they cannot have been the source of his account, which
Jiffers entirely #. theirs.
It is highly probable, therefore, that he
followed Justin and Irenaeus as far as they go, and that he recorded
the meeting with Peter in Rome as a fact commonly accepted in his
time, and one, for which he needed no written authority; or it is
possible that he had another source, unknown to us, as suggested
above (note 4).

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

Simon was quenched and immediately destroyed,
together with the man himself." And so greatly
did the splendor of piety illumine the minds of
Peter's hearers that they were not satisfied with
hearing once only, and were not content with
the unwritten teaching of the divine Gospel, but
with all sorts of entreaties they besought Mark,"
a follower of Peter, and the one whose Gospel
is extant, that he would leave them a written
monument of the doctrine which had been

ficiently disproved by history. The origin of the Church was due to
unknown persons, though it is possible we may obtain a hint of them

as apostles, and who were therefore, according to the usage of the

* John Mark, son ..? Mary (Acts xii. 12), a sister of Barnabas
(Col. iv. 10), was a companion of Paul and Barnabas in their mis
sionary journeys, and afterward a companion of Barnabas alone
(Acts xy. 39), and still later was with Paul again in Rome (Col. iv.
Io and Philemon 24), and with Peter when he wrote his first epistle
(1 Pet. v. 13).
For the later traditions concerning Mark, see the
next chapter, note 1.

* That Mark wrote the second Gospel under the influence of
Peter, or as a record of what he had heard from him, is the uni
versal tradition of antiquity.
Papias, in the famous and much
disputed passage (quoted by Eusebius, III. 39, below); is the first
to record the tradition. Justin Martyr refers to Mark's Gospel under
the name "Memoirs (à mouvnuove ouata) of Peter" (Dial. c. Tryph.
106; the translation in the Ante-Micene Fathers, Am. Ed. Vol.
I. p. 252, which resers the avrov to Christ, is incorrect; compare
Weiss, AV. T. Einleitung, p. 44, note 4).
Irenaeus (Adz". Haer.
III. 11; i, quoted below, V: 8. 2), Tertullian (Adv. Marcionem, IV.
5), and Örgen (quoted below, VI. 25) confirm the tradition, which
is repeated over and over again by the Fathers.

The question as to the real authorship of our second Gospel, or
rather as to its composition and its relation to Matthew and Luke, is
a very difficult one. The relationship of the three synoptical Gospels
was first discussed by Augustine (19e Consensu A'wangelistartemi),
who defended the traditional order, but made Mark dependent upon
Matthew. This view prevailed until the beginning of the present
century, when the problem was attacked anew, and since then it has
been the crux of the literary criticism of the Bible. The three have
been held to be dependent upon each other, and every possible order
has sound its advocates; a common source has been assumed for the
three: the Hebrew Matthew, the Gospel according to the Hebrews
(see Bk. III. chap. 25, note 24), our canonical Gospel of Mark, or an
original Mark, resembling the present one; a o: of fragmentary
documents have been assumed; while others, finally, have admitted
only oral tradition as the basis.
According to Baur's tendency
theory, Matthew (polemically Jewish-Christian) came first, followed
by an original Ło. (polemically Pauline-Christian), then by our
Mark, which was based upon both and written in the interest of neu
trality, and lastly by our present Luke, designed as a final irenicum.
This view now finds few advocates. The whole matter is still un
settled, but criticism seems to be gradually converging toward a
common ground type (or rather two independent types) for all three,
while at the same time maintaining the relative independence of the
three, one toward the other. What these ground types were, is a
matter of still sharper dispute, although criticism is gradually draw
ing their larger features with more and more certainty and clearness.
(The latest discussion upon the subject by Handmann, das Hebråer.
Evangelium, makes the two types the "Ur-Marcus" and the Gos
Ael of the Hebrews.) That in the last analysis, however, some
space must still be left for floating tradition, or for documents irre
ducible to the one or two types, seems absolutely certain.
For
further information as to the state of discussion upon this intricate
problem, see among recent works, especially Weiss, Einleitung, p.
73 sqq., Holtzmann, Einleitung, p. 328 sqq., and Schaff, Ch. Hist.
. 575 sqq., where the literature down to 1882 is given with great
fullness.
Conservative opinion puts the composition of all the syn
optic Gospels before the destruction of Jerusalem (for the date of
Luke, see III.4, note 12); but the critical school, while throwing the
original type back of that date, considers the composition of our
present Gospels to have been the gradual work of years, assuming

And the multitude of believers, both men
and women, that were collected there at

given by him to the work of Mark, contradicts the account of Clem

In Bk. VI.
chap. 14 he quotes from the Hyeotyposes of Clement, a passage
which must be identical with the one referred to in this place, for
it is from the same work and the general account is the same; but
there Clement says expressly, "which when Peter understood he
neither directly hindered nor encouraged it."

". The passage from Papias is quoted below in Bk. III. chap. 39.
Papias is a witness to the general fact that Mark wrote down what
he had heard from Peter, but not (so far as he is extant) to the
details of the account as given by Eusebius. Upon Papias himself,
see Bk. III. chap. 39.

* 1 Pet. v. 13. Commentators are divided as to the place in
which Peter wrote this epistle (compare Schaff's Church Hist. I.
p. 744 sqq.). The interpretation given by Eusebius is the patristic
and Roman Catholic opinion, and is maintained by many Protestant
commentators.
But on the other hand the literal use of the word
"Babylon" is defended by a great number of the leading scholars of
the present day. Compare Weiss, N. T. Einleitung, p. 433, note 1.
* That Mark labored in Egypt is stated also by Epiphanius
(Harr. LI. 6), by Jerome (de for. ill. 8), by Nicephorus (H. E.

But if the tradition that he wrote his Gos
pel in Rome under Peter (or after Peter's death, as the best tradition
puts it, so, e.g. Irenaeus), be correct, then this date is hopelessly
wrong. The varying traditions are at best very uncertain, and the

PHILO'S ACCOUNT OF THE THERAPEUTAE.

1 17

CHAPTER XVII.

Philo's Account of the Ascetics of Egypt.

It is also said that Philo in the reign of
Claudius became acquainted at Rome with
Peter, who was then preaching there.'
Nor is
this indeed improbable, for the work of which
we have spoken, and which was composed by
him some years later, clearly contains those
rules of the Church which are even to this
day observed among us. And since he de
scribes as accurately as possible the life of
our ascetics, it is clear that he not only knew,
but that he also approved, while he venerated
and extolled, the apostolic men of his time, who
were as it seems of the Hebrew race, and hence
observed, after the manner of the Jews, the
most of the customs of the ancients.
In
the work to which he gave the title, On a
Contemplative Zife or on Suppliants," after af.
* This tradition that Philo met Peter in Rome and formed an
acquaintance with him is repeated by Jerome (de vir ill. 11), and
by Photius (Cod. Ioš), who even goes further, and says directly that
Philo became a Christian. The tradition, however, must be regarded
as quite worthless.
It is absolutely certain from Philo's own works,
and from the otherwise numerous traditions of antiquity that he
never was a Christian, and aside from the report of Eusebius (for
Jerome and Photius do not represent an independent tradition) there
exists no hint of such a meeting between Peter and Philo; and when
we realize that Philo was already an old man in the time of Caius
(see above, chap. 4, note 8), and that Peter certainly did not reach
Rome before the later years of Nero's reign, we may say that such
a meeting as Eusebius records (only upon tradition, Aoyos Exet) is
certainly not historical. Where Eusebius got the tradition we do
not know. It may have been manufactured in the interest of the
Philonic authorship of the 19e vita contemplatira, or it may have
been a natural outgrowth of the ascription of that work to him,
some such explanation suggesting itself to the reader of that work
as necessary to explain Philo's supposed praise of Christian monks.
Philo's visit to Rome during the reign of Caligula being a well
known historic fact, and Peter's visit to Rome during the reign of
Claudius being assumed as likewise historic (see above, chap. 14,
note 8), it was not difficult to suppose a meeting between them
(the great Christian apostle and the great Jewish i. and
to invent for the purpose a second visit of Philo to Rome. It seems
robable that the ascription of the work De zosta contempoatra to
hilo came before the tradition of his acquaintance with Peter in
Rome (which is first mentioned by Eusebius); but in any case the
two were mutually corroborative.

* nept 8tov beepmtixov in trerov: De l'ita Contemplatova. This
work is still extant, and is given by Mangey, II. 471-486.
Eusebius is
the first writer to mention it, and he identifies the Therapeutae de
scribed in it with the Christian monks, and assumes in consequence
that monasticism in the form in which he knew it existed in the apos
tolic age, and was known and praised by Philo. This opinion was
generally adopted by the Fathers (with the single exception of
Photius, Cod. 105, who looked upon the Therapeutae as a Jewish sect)
and prevailed unquestioned until the Reformation, when in the Protes.
tant reaction against monasticism it was denied that monks existed
in the apostolic age, and that the Therapeutae were Christians at all.
Various opinions as to their identity have been held since that time,
the commonest being that they were a Jewish sect or school, parallel
with the Palestinian Essenes, or that they were an outgrowth of
Alexandrian, Neo-Pythagoreanism. The former opinion may be
said to have been the prevailing one among Christian scholars until
Lucius, in his work entitled Die Therapeuten und ihre Stellung
fn der Gesch. der Askese (Strassburg, 1879), proved (what had been
asserted already by Grätz and Jost) that ão #. are really
to be identified with Christian monks, and that the work De Iota
Contemolativa is not a genuine work of Philo's.
If the former
F. is proved, the latter follows of necessity, for it is abso
. impossible to suppose that monasticism can have existed in so
developed a form (or indeed in any form) in the time of Philo. On
the other hand it may be proved that the work is not Philonic, and
yet it may not follow that the Therapeutae are to be identified with
Christian monks. , And so some scholars reject the Philonic author.
ship while still maintaining the Jewish character of the Therapeutae
(e.g. Nicolas, Kuenen, and Weingarten; see Schürer, Gesch. der
7uden im Zeitalter Wesu Christi, p. 863).
In the opinion of the
writer, who agrees therein with the great majority of scholars, Lu
cius has, conclusively demonstrated both his propositions, and has
shown that the o: De Vita Contemplativa is the production of

firming in the first place that he will add to
those things which he is about to relate nothing
contrary to truth or of his own invention," he says
that these men were called Therapeutae and the
women that were with them Therapeutrides."
He then adds the reasons for such a name, ex
plaining it from the fact that they applied reme
dies and healed the souls of those who came to
them, by relieving them like physicians, of evil
passions, or from the fact that they served and
worshiped the Deity in purity and sincer
ity.
Whether Philo himself gave them this
name, employing an epithet well suited to
their mode of life, or whether the first of them
really called themselves so in the beginning,
since the name of Christians was not yet every
where known, we need not discuss here.
He bears witness, however, that first of all
they renounce their property. When they
begin the philosophical" mode of life, he says,
they give up their goods to their relatives, and
then, renouncing all the cares of life, they go
forth beyond the walls and dwell in lonely fields
and gardens, knowing well that intercourse with
people of a different character is unprofitable
and harmful. They did this at that time, as
seems probable, under the influence of a spirited
and ardent faith, practicing in emulation the

Lucius concludes with the following words: "Wir haben es
demnach in D.V.C. mit einer Tendenzschrift zu thun, welche, da sie
eine weit ausgebildete und in zahlreichen Ländern verbreitete As.
kese, so wie Zustände voraussetzt, genau wie dieselben nur im Chris

hunderts, unter dem Namen Philo's, zu Gunsten der Christlichen
Askese, verfasste Apologie, als erstes Glied eines an derartigen
Producte überaus reichen iteraturzweige der, alten. Kirche."
Compare with Lucius' work the reviews of it by Hilgenfeld in the
Zeitschrift /ăr wiss. Theol., 1889, pp. 423-449, and by, Schürer
in the Theologische Literaturzeitung, 1880, No. 5. The latter
especially has added some important considerations with reference
to the reasons for the composition of this work under the name of
Philo. Assuming then the correctness of Lucius' conclusions, we
see that Eusebius was quite right in identifying the Therapeutae with
the Christian monks as he knew them in }. day, but that he was
quite wrong in accepting the Philonic authorship of the work in
question, and in concluding that the institution of monasticism as
!. knew it existed already in the apostolic age (compare note 19,
low).
* It may fairly be doubted whether the work does not really con
tain considerable that is not in strict accordance with the facts ob
served by the author, whether his account is not to an extent ideal
ized, and whether, in his endeavor to emphasize the Jewish character
of the Therapeutae, with the design of establishing the antiquity of
monasticism (compare the review of Schürer referred to above), he
has not allowed himself to introduce some imaginative elements.
The strong asseveration which he makes of the truthfulness of his
account would rather increase than allay this suspicion; and the
account itself at certain points seems to bear it out. On the whole,
however, it may be regarded as a reasonably accurate sketch. Woe
it not such, Eusebius would not have accepted it, so unresery edly
as he does, as an account of Christian monks.
Lucius' exhibition of
the points of similarity between the practices of the Therapeutae, as
described here, and of early Christian monks, as known from other
sources, is very interesting (see p. 158 sq.).

companions of the apostles sold their possessions
and their property and distributed to all accord
ing to the necessity of each one, so that no one
among them was in want. "For as many as
were possessors of lands or houses," as the ac
count says, "sold them and brought the prices
of the things that were sold, and laid them at
the apostles' feet, so that distribution was made
unto every man according as he had need.""
Philo bears witness to facts very much
like those here described and then adds
the following account: * "Everywhere in the
world is this race" found. For it was fitting that
both Greek" and Barbarian should share in
what is perfectly good.

above the lake Maria" upon a low hill excellently
situated on account of its security and the
mildness of the atmosphere." And then a
little further on, after describing the kind
of houses which they had, he speaks as follows
concerning their churches, which were scattered
about here and there :" "In each house there is
a sacred apartment which is called a sanctuary
and monastery," where, quite alone, they per

bring nothing into it, neither drink nor food, nor
any of the other things which contribute to the
necessities of the body, but only the laws, and

had heard them expounding their sacred writ
ings.
But it is highly probable that the works
of the ancients, which he says they had, were
the Gospels and the writings of the apostles,
and probably some expositions of the ancient
prophets, such as are contained in the Epistle
to the Hebrews, and in many others of
Paul's Epistles. Then again he writes as
follows concerning the new psalms which
they composed : ""So that they not only spend
their time in meditation, but they also compose
songs and hymns to God in every variety of
metre and melody, though they divide them, of
course, into measures of more than common
solemnity." The same book contains an
account of many other things, but it seemed
necessary to select those facts which exhibit the
characteristics of the ecclesiastical mode
of life.
But if any one thinks that what
has been said is not peculiar to the Gospel
polity, but that it can be applied to others be
sides those mentioned, let him be convinced by
the subsequent words of the same author, in
which, if he is unprejudiced, he will find undis
Philo's
puted testimony on this subject.
words are as follows: ""Having laid down
temperance as a sort of foundation in the
soul, they build upon it the other virtues. None
of them may take food or drink before sunset,
since they regard philosophizing as a work worthy
of the light, but attention to the wants of the
body as proper only in the darkness, and there
fore assign the day to the former, but to the
latter a small portion of the night.
But
some, in whom a great desire for knowledge
dwells, forget to take food for three days; and
some are so delighted and feast so luxuriously
upon wisdom, which furnishes doctrines richly
and without stint, that they abstain even twice
as long as this, and are accustomed, after six
days, scarcely to take necessary food." These
statements of Philo we regard
referring
clearly and indisputably to those of our com
inunion.

But if after these things any one still obsti

him renounce his incredulity and be convinced
by yet more striking examples, which are to be
found nowhere else than in the evangelical
religion of the Christians."

whom we are speaking, and that the most of

their chastity, not out of necessity, as some of
the priestesses among the Greeks," but rather by
their own choice, through zeal and a desire for
wisdom. And that in their earnest desire to live
with it as their companion they paid no atten
tion to the pleasures of the body, seeking not
mortal but immortal progeny, which only the
pious soul is able to bear of itself. Then
after a little he adds still more emphati
cally: * "They expound the Sacred Scriptures
figuratively by means of allegories.
For the
whole law seems to these men to resemble a liv
ing organism, of which the spoken words consti
tute the body, while the hidden sense stored up
within the words constitutes the soul.
This hid
den meaning has first been particularly studied
by this sect, which sees, revealed as in a mirror
of names, the surpassing beauties of the
thoughts." Why is it necessary to add to
these things their meetings and the respec
tive occupations of the men and of the women
during those meetings, and the practices which
are even to the present day habitually observed
by us, especially such as we are accustomed to
observe at the feast of the Saviour's passion,
with fasting and night watching and study
of the divine Word.
These things the
above-mentioned author has related in his
own work, indicating a mode of life which has
been preserved to the present time by us alone,
recording especially the vigils kept in connection
with the great festival, and the exercises per
formed during those vigils, and the hymns cus
tomarily recited by us, and describing how, while
one sings regularly in time, the others listen in
silence, and join in chanting only the close of
the hymns; and how, on the days referred to,
they sleep on the ground on beds of straw, and
to use his own words," "taste no wine at all, nor
any flesh, but water is their only drink, and the
relish with their bread is salt and hyssop."
In addition to this Philo describes the order
of dignities which exists among those who
carry on the services of the church, mentioning
the diaconate, and the office of bishop, which

is but another example of his carelessness in regard to chronology
which comes out so often in his history. Compare Stroth's words:
"In der That ein wichtiger Beweis, der gerade der irrigen Meinung
des Eusebius am meisten ent gegen ist.
Denn sie hātten alt zum
Christenthum kommen müssen, sonst konnten sie ja zu Philo's
Zeiten unmöglich in Christenthum alt geworden sein, dessen Schrist
Eusebius selbst in die Regierung des Claudius setzt.
. Es ist beinahe
unbegreiflich, wie ein so guter Kopf, wie Eusebius ist, in so grobe
Irrthümer fallen konnte."

finding in these persons deacons and bishops. The similarity is too

whosoever desires a more accurate knowledge
of these matters may get it from the history

But that Philo, when he
wrote these things, had in view the first
heralds of the Gospel and the customs handed
down from the beginning by the apostles, is clear
to every one.

CHAPTER XVIII.

The Works of Philo' that have come down to us.

COPIOUS in language, comprehensive in
thought, sublime and elevated in his views
of divine Scripture, Philo has produced manifold
and various expositions of the sacred books.
On the one hand, he expounds in order the
events recorded in Genesis in the books to which
he gives the title A//egories of the Sacred Laws;"
on the other hand, he makes successive divisions
of the chapters in the Scriptures which are the
subject of investigation, and gives objections
and solutions, in the books which he quite suit
ably calls Questions and Answers on Genesis
and Exodus."
There are, besides these,
treatises expressly worked out by him on
certain subjects, such as the two books On Agri
culture," and the same number On Drunken

ptai').

close to be merely accidental, and the comment of Stroth upon this
passage is quite unwarranted: "Was einer doch alles in einer Stelle

p. 831 sqq. The best (though it leaves much to be desired) com
plete edition of Philo's works is that of Mangey: 2 vols., folio,
London, 1742; English translation of Philo's works by Yonge, 4 vols.,
London, 1854-55. Upon Philo's life, see chaps. 4-6, above. Eusebius,
in his Prof. Evang., quotes extensively from Philo's works and
preserves some fragments of which we should otherwise be ignorant.
This work is still extant, and, ac
cording to Schürer, includes all the works contained in the first vol
ume of Mangey's edition (except the De Officio J/undi, upon
which see §. p. 846 sqq. and note 11, below), comprising 16
different titles. The work forms the second great group of writings
upon the Pentateuch, and is a very full and allegorical commentary
upon Genesis, beginning with the second chapter and following it
verse by verse through i. fourth chapter; but from that point on
certain passages are selected and treated at length under special
titles, and under those titles, in Schürer's opinion, were published
by Philo as separate works, though really forming a part of one
complete whole. From this much confusion has resulted.
Eusebius
embraces all of the works as far as the end of chap. 4 (including five
titles in Mangey) under the one general title, but from that point on
he too quotes separate works under special titles, but at the end
§ 5, below) he unites them all as the "extant works on Genesis."

comparing the title of the work, as given by Johannes Monachus
and as found in the various MSS. of Philo, with the contents of the
work itself, there can be little doubt of the correctness of the shorter

hardly have written it.

According to Schürer (p. 85.2 sqq.) it forms an appendix to the
third great group of works upon the Pentateuch, containing those
laws which do not belong to any one of the ten commandments in

third group, as Schiirer describes it (p. 846), aims to give for non
Jews a complete view of the Mosaic legislation, and embraces, first,
the work upon the Creation (which in the MSS. and editions of
Philo is wrongly placed at the beginning in connection with the great

in his list of Philo's works, so that he does not make special mention

Eusebius mention a work "On the first and second covenants," in

It is plain
from Philo's own reference to the work (on p. 586 in Mangey's ed.)
that he wrote two books "On covenants," and not a work "On the
two covenants."

Heinichen and some other editors m porov kai &e to repov, a readin
which is more natural in view of the absence of an article of

This
reading must be correct unless we are to suppose that Eusebius mis
read Philo.
Fabricius suggests that Eusebius probably wrote a kat
B', which the copyists wrongly referred to the "covenants" instead
of to the number of the books, and hence gave the seminine instead
of the neuter form.

This work "On covenants," or "On the whole discussion con
cerning covenants" (as Philo gives it), is now lost, as it was already
in the time of Eusebius; at least he knew of it only from Philo's
reference to it.

It opens the second
division of the third great group of writings on the Pentateuch (see
note 11, above): the biographical division, mentioning Enos, Enoch
and Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but dealing chiefly with
Abraham. The biographies of Isaac and Jacob probably followed,
but they are lost, and we have no trace of them, so that the life of
Joseph (see below, note 26) in the MSS. follows directly upon that
of Aloh. (Schürer, p. 848 sqq.).

chus (incai'ities) quotes from the latter part under the title rept
Yoyavrov (according to Mangey, I. 262, note, and 272, note).
But
the two are divided in Mangey's edition, where the first is given
under the title mept yuyavtsov (I. 262-272), the second under the
title or a spontov (I. 272-290).

two separate works.

whom Schürer agrees. The genuineness of the #. is generally
admitted, though it has been disputed on insufficient grounds by

mous work, which, however, was " said to be the result of Philo's
industry."
Jerome, too, in speaking of the same work (at the
beginning of his own work, De nominous Hebraicos), says that,
according to the testimony of Origen, it was the work of Philo.
For Jerome, too, therefore, it was an anonymous work. This testi
mony of Origen cannot, according to Schürer, be sound in his ex
tant works, but in his Comment, in 9 oamn. II. 27 (ed. Lommatzsch,
I., 50), he speaks of a work, upon the same subject, the author of
which he does not know. The book therefore in vicw of the exist
ing state of the tradition in regard to it, is usually thought to be the
work of some other writer than Philo.
In its original form it is no
longer extant (and in the absence of this original it is impossible to
decide the question of authorship), though there exist a number of
works upon the same subject o are probably based upon this
lost original. Jerome, e.g., informs us that his Lièer de Vom rur

the Romans and of derogatory references to the emperor Caligula

It is in fact quite unlikely that
Philo was in Rome during the reign of Claudius (see above, chap. 17,
note 1). The report given here by Eusebius owes its origin perhaps
to the imagination of some man who supposed that Philo was in
Rome during the reign of Claudius (on the ground of the other tra
dition already referred to), and whose fancy led him to picture Philo
as obtaining at that time his revenge upon the emperor Caligula in
this dramatic way.
It was not difficult to imagine that this bitterly
sarcastic and vivid work might have been intended for public read
ing, and it was an attractive suggestion that the Senate might have
constituted the audience.

1 This disturbance (described by Jos. B. 9. II. 12. 1, and Ant.
XX. 5. 3) took place in 48 A.D. while Cumanus was procurator of
Judea.
During the Passover feast the procurator, as was the cus
tom, brought extra troops to Jerusalem to guard against any uproar
which might arise among the great mass of people.
One of the
soldiers, with the view of insulting the Jews, conducted himself
indecently in their presence, whereupon, so great an uproar arose
that the procurator felt obliged to collect his troops upon the
temple hill, but the appearance of the soldiers so greatly alarmed
the multitude assembled there that they fled in all directions and
crushed each other to death in their eagerness to escape.
Josephus,
in his Gewish IP'ar, gives the number of the slain as ten thousand,
and in the Antion ities as twenty thousand. The latter work was writ
ten last, but knowing Josephus' sondness for exaggerating numbers,
we shall perhaps not accept the correction as any nearer the truth.
That Eusebius gives thirty thousand need not arouse suspicion as to
his honesty, - he could have had no object for changing "twenty"
to "thirty," when the former was certainly great enough, - we need
simply remember how easily numbers become altered in transcrip
tion. Valesius says that this disturbance took place under Quadratus
in 52 A.D. (quoting Pearson's Ann. Paul/. p. 11 sqq., and Tacitus,
Ann. XII. 54).
But Eusebius, in his Choon., gives the eighth
year of Claudius (48 A.D.), and Orosius, VII. 4, gives the seventh
year.

Judea remained a Roman province throughout his reign, while his
dominion comprised only the northeastern part of Palestine. . He
enjoyed, however, the right of appointing and removing the high
priests, and under Nero his domain was somewhat increased by the
addition of several cities of Galilee, and Perea. He sided with the
Romans in the Jewish war, and afterwards went to Rome, where he
died in 100 A.D., the last prince of the Herodian line.
It was before
this Agrippa that Paul made his defense recorded in Acts xxvi.

The Events which took Pace in Jerusalem dur.
ing the A'eign of Mero.

JOSEPHUS again, in the twentieth book of
his Antiquities, relates the quarrel which
arose among the priests during the reign of
Nero, while Felix was procurator of Judea.
His words are as follows " : "There arose a
quarrel between the high priests on the
one hand and the priests and leaders of the
people of Jerusalem on the other." And each
of them collected a body of the boldest and
most restless men, and put himself at their
head, and whenever they met they hurled invec
tives and stones at each other.
And there was
no one that would interpose; but these things
were done at will as if in a city destitute
of a ruler. And so great was the shamelessness and audacity of the high priests
that they dared to send their servants to the
threshing-floors to seize the tithes due to the
priests; and thus those of the priests that were
poor were seen to be perishing of want.
In
this way did the violence of the factions
prevail over all justice."
And the same
author again relates that about the same
time there sprang up in Jerusalem a certain
kind of robbers," "who by day," as he says, "and
in the middle of the city slew those who
met them."
For, especially at the feasts,
they mingled with the multitude, and with
short swords, which they concealed under their
garments, they stabbed the most distinguished
men. And when they fell, the murderers them
selves were among those who expressed their
indignation. And thus on account of the con

Chron., puts the accession of Felix in the eleventh year of Clau
dius (51 A.D.), and the accession of Festus in the fourteenth year
(54 A.D.), but both of these dates are clearly incorrect (cf. Wieseler,
p. 68, note).

* Eusebius evidently supposed the Roman province at this time
to have been limited to Samaria, Galilee, and Perca; but in this he
was wrong, for it included also Judea (see preceding note), Agrippa
II. having under him only the tetrarchies mentioned above (note 3)
and a scw cities of Galilee and Perca. He had, however, the au
thority over the temple and the power of appointing the high priests
(see }." A nt. XX. 8. 11 and 9. 1, 4, 6, 7), which had been given
by Claudius to his uncle, the king of Chalcis o A nt. XX. 1.3).
Felix showed himself throughout very
mean and cruel, and his procuratorship was marked with continual
disturbances.

2 This disturbance arose toward the end of Felix's term, under
the high priest Ishmael, who had been appointed by Agrippa but a
short time before. No cause is given by Josephus for the quarrel.

* B. 7. II. 13. 3. These open robberies and murders, which
took place in Jerusalem at this period, were in part a result of the
conduct of Felix himself in the murder of Jonathan (see the next
note).
At least his conduct in this case started the practice, which
was kept up with zeal by the ruffians who were so numerous at
that time.

AFTER other matters he proceeds as fol

For there appeared in the land
an impostor who aroused faith in himself as a
prophet, and collected about thirty thousand
of those whom he had deceived, and led them
from the desert to the so-called Mount of Olives
whence he was prepared to enter Jerusalem by
force and to overpower the Roman garrison and
seize the government of the people, using those
who made the attack with him as body
guards.
But Felix anticipated his attack,
and went out to meet him with the Roman
legionaries, and all the people joined in the
defense, so that when the battle was fought the
Egyptian fled with a few followers, but the most
of them were destroyed or taken captive."
Josephus relates these events in the second

* This high priest, Jonathan, had used his influence in procuring
the appointment of Felix as procurator, and was therefore upon inti
mate terms with him, and took the liberty of advising and rebuking
him at pleasure; until at last he became so burdensome to Felix
that he bribed a trusted friend of Jonathan to bring about his mur
der. The friend accomplished it by introducing a number of robbers
into the city, who, being unknown, mingled freely with the people
and slew Jonathan and many others with him, in order to turn away

!. has omitted to mention Jonathan's appointment to the
igh priesthood, and this has led Valesius to conclude that he was
not really a high priest, but simply one of the upper class of priests.
But this conclusion is unwarranted, as Josephus expressly calls him
the high priest in the passage referred to (cf. also the remarks of
Reland, quoted in Havercamp's ed. of Josephus, p. 912).
Wieseler
(p. 77, note) thinks that Jonathan was not high priest at this time,
but that he had been high priest and was called so on that account.
He makes Ananias high priest from 48 to 57, quoting Anger, De
temporum in Act. AA. ratione.

* Jos. B. 9. II. 13. 5.
* An Egyptian Jew; one of the numerous magicians and false
prophets that arose during this century. He prophesied that Jeru
salem, which had made itself a heathen city, would be destroyed by
God, who would throw down the walls as he had the walls of
Jericho, and then he and his followers, as the true Israel and the
army of God, would gain the victory over the oppressors and rule
the world. For this purpose he collected his followers upon the
Mount of Olives, from whence they were to witness the falling of
the walls and begin their attack.

Josephus gives two different accounts of this event.

In the
A. 7, he says that this Egyptian led thirty thousand men out of the
desert to the Mount of Olives, but that Felix attacked them, and
the Egyptian "escaped with a few," while most of his followers
were either destroyed or captured.
In Amt. XX. 8.6, which was
written later, he states that the Egyptian led a multitude "out from
Jerusalem" to the Mount of Olives, and that when they were at
tacked by Felix, four hundred were slain and two hundred taken
captive. There seems to be here a glaring contradiction, but we
are able to reconcile the two accounts by supposing the Egyptian to
have brought a large sollowing of robbers from i. desert, which
was augmented by a great rabble from Jerusalem, until the number

against whom his attack had been directed, while the Egyptian
escaped with a small number (i.e. small in comparison with the
thirty thousand), who may well have been the four thousand men
tioned by the author of the Acts in the passage quoted below by
Eusebius.
It is no more difficult therefore to reconcile the Acts and
Josephus in this case than to reconcile Josephus with himself, and
we have no reason to assume a mistake upon the part of either one.
though as already remarked, numbers, are so treacherous in trans
cription that the difference may really have been originally less than
it is. Whenever the main elements of two accounts are in substan
tial agreement, little stress can be laid upon a difference in figures.
Cf. Tholuck, Glazowie raigkeit, p. 169 (quoted by Hackett, Cou.
on Acts, p. 254).
* Acts xxi. 38.
* Walesius and Heinichen assert that Eusebius is incorrect in
assigning this uproar, caused by the Egyptian, to the reign of Nero,
as he seems to do.
But their assertion is quite groundless, for Jo
sephus in both of his accounts relates the uproar among events
which he expressly assigns to Nero's reign, and there is no reason
to suppose |. the order of events given by him is incorrect. Vale
sius and Heinichen proceed on the crroneous assumption that Festus
succeeded Felix in the second year of Nero, and that therefore, since
Paul was two years in Caesarea before the recall of Felix, the upris
ing of the Egyptian, which was referred to at the time of Paul's arrest
and just before he was carried to Caesarea, must have taken place be
fore the end of the reign of Claudius.
But it happens to be a fact
that Felix was succeeded by Festus at the earliest not before the
sixth year of Nero (see chap. 22, note 2, below). There is, there
fore, no ground for accusing either Josephus or Eusebius of a blun
der in the present case.

1 The exact year of the accession of Festus is not known, but it
is known that his death occurred before the summer of 62 A.D.; for
at that time his successor, Albinus, was already procurator, as we
can see from Josephus, A. 9. VI. 5. 3. But from the events recorded
by Josephus as happening during his term of office, we know he

* Acts xxv. sqq. The determination of the year in which Paul
was sent as a prisoner to Rome depends in part upon the determi
nation of the year of Festus' accession. He was in Rome (which he
reached in the spring) at least two years before the Noonic perse
cution (June, 64 A.D.), therefore as early as 62 A. p. He was sent

But is, as is probable, Festus became procurator in 60, then
Paul was sent to Rome in the autumn of the same year, and reached
Rome in the spring of 61.
This is now the commonly accepted
date; but the year 62 cannot be shut out (cf. Wieseler, thraf.).
Wieseler shows conclusively that Festus cannot have become procol
rator before 6o A.D., and hence Paul cannot have been taken to Rome
before the fall of that year.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[II. 22.

And Luke, who wrote the Acts of the Apostles,"
brought his history to a close at this point, after
stating that Paul spent two whole years at Rome
as a prisoner at large, and preached the
word of God without restraint." Thus after
he had made his defense it is said that the
apostle was sent again upon the ministry of
preaching," and that upon coming to the same
city a second time he suffered martyrdom."
In
this imprisonment he wrote his second epistle
to Timothy," in which he mentions his first
defense and his impending death.
But hear
his testimony on these matters: "At my

* See Acts xxviii. 30.

* See below, Bk. III. chap. 4.
• Eusebius is the first writer to record the release of Paul from a
first, and his martyrdom during a second Roman imprisonment. He
introduces the statement with the formula Agyos exel, which indi
cates probably that he has only an oral tradition, as his authority,
and his efforts to establish the fact by exegetical arguments show
how weak the tradition was. Many maintain that Eusebius follows
no tradition here, but records, simply his own conclusion formed
from a study of the Pastoral Epistles, which apparently necessitate a
second imprisonment.
But were this the case, he would hardly have
used the formula A&yos exei. The o may have arisen solel
upon exegetical *: but it can hardly have originated '...}.
Eusebius himself.
In accordance with this tradition, Eusebius, in
his Chron., gives, the date of Paul's death, as 67 A.D. Jerome (de
zor. ill. 5) and other later writers follow Eusebius (though Jerome
gives the date, as 68 instead of 67), and the tradition soon became
firmly established (see below, chap. 25, note 5). Scholars are #".
divided as to the fact of a second imprisonment.
Nearly all that
defend the genuineness of the Pastoral Epistles assume a second
imprisonment, though some (e.g. Wieseler, Ebrard, Reuss and others)
defend the epistles while assuming only one imprisonment; but this
is very difficult. On the other hand, most o: of the epistles

the interval - supposing him to have been released - there is again
a difference of opinion. The Pastoral Epistles, if assumed to be
genuine, seem to necessitate another visit to the Orient.
But for
such a visit there is no ancient tradition, although Paul himself, in
the Epistle to the Philippians, expresses his expectation of making
such a visit. On the other hand, there is an old tradition that he
visited Spain (which must of course have been during this interval,
as he did not reach it before the first imprisonment). The Murato
rian Fragment (from the end of the second century) records this tra
dition in a way to imply that it was universally known. Clement of
Rome (EAfstle to the Corinthians, c. 5.) is also claimed as a witness
for such a visit, but the interpretation of his words is doubtful, so
that little weight can be laid upon his statement. In later times the
tradition of this visit to Spain dropped out of the Church. The
strongest argument against the visit is the absence of any trace of

apostle to the Gentiles as its founder, it seems that it must have
asserted its claim and the tradition have been preserved at least in
that church.
This appears to the writer a fatal argument against
a journey to Spain. On the other hand, the absence of all tradition of
another journey to the Orient does not militate against such a visit,
for tradition at any place might easily preserve the fact of a visit of
the apostle, without preserving an accurate account of the number
of his visits if more than one were made. Of the defenders of the
Pastoral Epistles, that accept a second imprisonment, some assume
simply a journey to the Orient, others assume also the journey to
Spain.
tween the spring of 63 A.D., the time when he was prob
ably released, if released, and the date of his death (at the earliest
the summer of 64), there is time enough, but barely so, for both
journeys.
If the date of Paul's death be put later with Eusebius and
Jerome (as many modern critics put it), the time is of course quite
sufficient. Compare the various Lives of Paul, Commentaries, etc.,

* Eusebius looked upon the Pastoral Epistles as undoubtedly
genuine, and placed them among the Homologue mena, or undisputed
writings (compare Bk. III. chaps. 3 and 25). The external testi
mony for them is very strong, but their genuineness has, during the
present century, been quite widely denied upon internal grounds.
The advanced critical scholars of Germany treat their non-Pauline
authorship as completely established, and many otherwise conserva

He plainly indicates in these words that
on the former occasion, in order that the
preaching might be fulfilled by him, he was
rescued from the mouth of the lion, referring,
in this expression, to Nero, as is probable on
account of the latter's cruelty. He did not
therefore afterward add the similar statement,
"He will rescue me from the mouth of the
lion"; for he saw in the spirit that his end
would not be long delayed.
Wherefore he
adds to the words, "And he delivered me
from the mouth of the lion," this sentence:
"The Lord shall deliver me from every evil
work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly
kingdom," "indicating his speedy martyrdom ;
which he also foretells still more clearly in the
same epistle, when he writes, "For I am now
ready to be offered, and the time of my
departure is at hand.""
In his second
epistle to Timothy, moreover, he indicates
that Luke was with him when he wrote," but at
his first defense not even he." Whence it is
probable that Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles
at that time, continuing his history down
to the period when he was with Paul." But
these things have been adduced by us to
show that Paul's martyrdom did not take place
at the time of that Roman sojourn which Luke

reason for supposing the book to have been written at the point of
time at which its account of Paul ceases. The design of the book
(its text is found in the eighth verse of the first chapter) was to
ive an account of the progress of the Church from Jerusalem to
ome, not to write the life of Paul. The record of Paul's death at
the close of the book would have been quite out of harmony with
this design, and would have formed a decided anti-climax, as the
author was wise enough to understand. He was writing, not a life
of Paul, nor of any apostle or group of apostles, but a history of
the planting of the Church of Christ. The advanced critics, who
deny that the Acts were written by a pupil of Paul, of course put its
composition much later, - some into the time of Domitian, most into
the second century.
But even such critics admit the genuineness
of certain portions of the book (the celebrated "We'' passages),
and the old Tübingen theory of intentional misrepresentation on the
part of the author is finding less favor even among the most radical

records.
It is probable indeed that as Nero
was more disposed to mildness in the be
ginning, Paul's defense of his doctrine was more
easily received; but that when he had advanced
to the commission of lawless deeds of daring,
he made the apostles as well as others the subjects
of his attacks."

CHAPTER XXIII.

The Martyrdom of James, who was called the
Brother of the Lord.

BUT after Paul, in consequence of his
appeal to Caesar, had been sent to Rome
by Festus, the Jews, being frustrated in their
hope of entrapping him by the snares which
they had laid for him, turned against James,
the brother of the Lord,' to whom the episcopal
seat at Jerusalem had been entrusted by the
apostles." The following daring measures
were undertaken by them against him. Lead
ing him into their midst they demanded of
him that he should renounce faith in Christ in
the presence of all the people.
But, contrary
to the opinion of all, with a clear voice, and with
greater boldness than they had anticipated, he
spoke out before the whole multitude and con
fessed that our Saviour and Lord Jesus is the
Son of God.
But they were unable to bear
longer the testimony of the man who, on ac
count of the excellence of ascetic virtue" and
of piety which he exhibited in his life, was
esteemed by all as the most just of men, and
consequently they slew him.
Opportunity for
this deed of violence was furnished by the pre
vailing anarchy, which was caused by the fact
that Festus had died just at this time in Judea,
and that the province was thus without a gov
ernor and head.* The manner of James'
death has been already indicated by the
above-quoted words of Clement, who records
that he was thrown from the pinnacle of the
temple, and was beaten to death with a club."
But Hegesippus," who lived immediately after
the apostles, gives the most accurate account in
the fifth book of his Memoirs.' He writes
as follows: "James, the brother of the Lord,

10. Whether Eusebius' conclusion be correct or not, it is a fact
that Nero became much more cruel and tyrannical in the latter part
of his reign. The famous "first five years," however exaggerated
the reports about them, must at least have been of a very different
character from the remainder of his reign.
But those five years of
clemency and justice were past before Paul reached Rome.

iour to the present day; for there were many
that bore the name of James. He was holy
from his mother's womb ; and he drank
no wine nor strong drink, nor did he eat flesh.
No razor came upon his head; he did not anoint
himself with oil, and he did not use the
bath. He alone was permitted to enter
into the holy place; for he wore not woolen
but linen garments. And he was in the habit of
entering alone into the temple, and was frequently
found upon his knees begging forgiveness for the
people, so that his knees became hard like those

" "The dramatic account of James by Hegesippus is an over
drawn picture from the middle of the second century, colored by
Judaizing traits which may have been derived from the Ascents of
9ames, and other Apocryphal sources. He turns James into a
Jewish priest and Nazarite saint (cf. his advice to Paul, Acts xxi.
23, 24), who drank no wine, ate no flesh, never shaved nor took a
bath, and wore only linen.

legalistic, rather than Essenic and ascetic '' (Schaff, Ch. Hist. I. p.

For Peter's asceticism, see the Clementine Recognitions,
VII. 6; and for Matthew's, see Clement of Alexandria's Paedagogus,
in '08Atas: probably a corruption of the Heb. Ep bek, which
signifies "bulwark of the people." The same name is given to
James by Epiphanius, by Dionysius the Areopagite, and others.

1% For a discussion of this very difficult question, whose inter
pretation has puzzled all commentators, see Routh, Rel, Saç. I
.434 sq., and Heinichen's Mel. IV., in his edition of Eusebius, Vol.
sis. p. 654 sqq. The explanation given by Grabe (in his Spic. PP.
p. 254), seems to me the best.
According to him, the Jews wish to
ascertain James' opinion in regard to Christ, whether he considers
him a true guide or an impostor, and therefore they ask, "What (of
what sort) is the gate (or the way) of Christ?
Is it a gate which
opens into life (or a way which leads to life); or is it a gate which
opens upon death (or a way which leads to death)?" Cs. Matt. vii.
13, 14, where the two ways and the two gates are compared. ... The
Jews had undoubtedly often heard Christ called "the Way," and
thus they might naturally use the expression in asking James' opin:
ion about Jesus, "Is he the true or the false }}. " or, "Is this way
true or false?" The answer of James which follows is then perfectly
consistent: "He is the Saviour," in which words he expresses, as
decidedly as he can his belief that the way or the gate of Christ led
to salvation. And so below, in § 12, where he gives a second answer
to the question, expressing his belief in Christ still more emphati
cally. %. is somewhat similar to the explanation of Heinichen

Hegesippus' account.
James' position as a Christian must have
been well enough known to prevent such a request being made to
him in good faith (and there is no sign that it was made in any other
spirit); and at any rate, after his reply to them already recorded,
such a repetition of the question in public is absurd.
Fabricius, who

observed with great strictness for centuries, and received a bless

sered. Some think that Hegesippus was mistaken, - the source
from which he took his account having confounded this ascetic
Rechabite with a priest, - but this is hardly probable.
Plumptre,
in Smith's Bo. Dict, art. Rechabites (which see for a full account of
the tribe), thinks that the blessing pronounced upon them by God
(Jer. xxxv. 19) included their solemn adoption among the people of
Israel, and their incorporation into the tribe of Levi, and therefore into
the number of the priests.
Others (e.g. Tillemont, As. E. I. p. 633)
have supposed that inany Jews, including also priests, embraced the
practices and the institutions of the Rechabites and were therefore
identified with them. The language here, however, seems to imply
a native Rechabite, and it is probable that Hegesippus at least o

phanius and the Rechabite of Hegesippus are not necessarily identi

Epiphanius', as the more exact, was undoubtedly the later tradition,
and an intentional improvement upon the vagueness of the original.

the stoning.
But Hegesippus' account, which is the fullest that we
have, gives us the means of reconciling the briefer accounts of
Clement and of Josephus, and we have no reason to think either
account incorrect.

* Walesius remarks that the monument (or room) could not have
stood through the destruction of Jerusalem until the time of Hege
sippus, nor could James have been buried near the temple, as the
Jews always buried their dead without the city walls.
Tillemont
attempted to meet the difficulty by supposing that James was thrown
from a pinnacle of the temple overlooking the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
and therefore fell without .. walls, where he was stoned and buried,
and where his monument could remain undisturbed.
Tillemont,
however, afterward withdrew his explanation, which was beset with
difficulties.
Others have supposed that the monument mentioned
by Hegesippus was erected after the destruction of Jerusalem (cf.
Jerome, de vir. ill. 2), while his body was buried in another place.
This is quite possible, as Hegesippus must have seen some monu
ment of James which was reported to have been the original one,
but which must certainly have been of later date. A monument,
which is now commonly io as the tomb of St. James, is shown
upon the east side of the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and therefore at a
considerable distance from the temple.

His agreement with Clement is not

but is given b § en (Contra Celsum, I. 47), which shows at any

It is probable there
fore, that the copies of Josephus, used by Origen and Eusebius con
tained this interpolation, while the copies from which our existing
MSS. drew were without it.
It is of course possible, especially since
he does not mention the reference in Josephus, that Eusebius quoted
these words from Qrigen.
But this does not help matters any, as
it still remains as difficult to account for the occurrence of the words
ino and even if Eusebius did take the passage from Origen
instead of from Josephus himself, we still have no right with Jach
mann (13. p.40) to accuse him of wilful deception.
For with his great
confidence in Qrigen, and his unbounded admiration for him, and
with his naturally uncritical spirit, he would readily accept as true

taken from }. even though he could not find it in his own

It is in fact very difficult to suppose

as the words stand there is no good reason to doubt their genuineness.
* The date of the martyrdom of James, given here by Josephus,
is 61 or 62 A.D. (at the time of the Passover, according to Hegesippus,
§ 10, above). There is no reason for doubting this date which is
given with such exactness by Josephus, and it is further confirmed
by Eusebius in his Chron., who puts James's martyrdom in the sev
enth year of Nero, i.e. 61 A.D., while Joe puts it in the eighth
year of Nero. The Clementines and the Chronicon Paschałe,
which state that James survived Peter, and are therefore cited in
support of a later date, are too late to be of any weight over against
such an exact statement as that of Josephus, especially since Peter
and James, died at such a distance from one another.
Hegesippus
has been cited over and over again by historians as assigning the
date of the martyrdom to 69 A.D., and as thus being in direct conflict
with Josephus; as a consequence some follow his supposed date,
others that of Josephus. But I can find no reason for asserting, that
Hegesippus assigns the martyrdom, to 69.
Certainly his words in
this chapter, which are referred to, by no means necessitate such an
assumption. He concludes his account with the words, Kai e i 8ws
Oveomaa tavos m.o.A. opke a trous. The moat opkel airous is certainly
to be referred to the commencement of the war (not to the siege of
the city of Jerusalem, which was undertaken by Titus, not by Ves
o, i.e. to the year 67 A.D., and in such an account as this, in
which the overthrow of the Jews is designedly presented in connec
tion with the death of James, it is hyper-criticism to insist that the
word ev6vs must indicate a space of time of only a few months'
duration.
It is a very indefinite word, and the most we can draw
from Hegesippus' account is that not long before Vespasian's inva
sion of Judea, James was slain. The same may be said in regard to
Eusebius' report in Bk. III. chap. 11, § 1, which certainly is not
definite enough to be cited as a contradiction of his express state:

Schürer points out (Gesch. der Juden im Zeitalter jesu Christi,
p. 169 sq.), this conclusion is incorrect, and all that the passage in
plies is that the Sanhedrim could not hold a sovereign process, that
is, could not meet for the purpose of passing sentence of death and
executing the sentence, during the absence or without the consent of
the procurator.
For the transaction of ordinary business the con
sent of the procurator was not necessary. Compare the Commenta

referred to above.

It is common to translate the word vô90s, "spuri

enough from this passage, as also from others, that Eusebius did not
employ the word in that sense. He commonly used it, in fact, in a
loose way, to mean "disputed," in the same sense in which he often
employed the word a wrixeyou evos. Lücke, indeed, maintained that
Eusebius always used the words vó60s and arroweyduevos as synony
mous; but in Bk. III. chap. 25, as pointed out in note 1 on that
chapter, he employed the words as respective designations of two
distinct classes of books.

Irenaeus seems to have
known the epistle (his works exhibit some apparent reminiscences
of it), but he nowhere directly cites it. The Muratorian Fragment
omits it, but the Syriac Peshito contains it, and Clement of Alexan

express himself with decision as to its authenticity. From his time
on it was commonly accepted as the work of "James, the Lord's

Eusebius throws it among the antilegomena; not neces
sarily because he considered it unauthentic, but because the early
testimonies for it are too few to raise it to the dignity of one of the
homologoumena (see Bk. III. chap. 25, note 1).
Luther rejected
the epistle upon purely dogmatic grounds. The advanced critical
school are unanimous in considering it a post-apostolic work, and
many conservative scholars agree with them.
See Holtzmann's
Ainleitung, p. 475 sqq., and Weiss' Einleitung, p. 396 sqq. The
latter defends its authenticity (i.e. the authorship of James, the
brother of the Lord), and, in agreement with many other scholars of
conservative tendencies, throws its origin back into the early part of
the fifties.

the antilegomena by Eusebius in Bk. Il I. chap, 25) is about as
well supported as that of the Epistle of James. The Peshito does
not contain it, and the Syrian Church in general rejected it for a
number of centuries. The Muratorian Fragment accepts it, and
Tertullian evidently considered it a work of Jude, the apostle (see
De Custo Fem. I. 3). The first to quote from it is Clement of
Alexandria, who wrote a commentary upon it in connection with
the other catholic epistles, according to Eusebius, VI. 14.1. Origen
looked upon it much as he looked upon the Epistle o James, but
did not make the "Jude, the brother of James," one of the twelve
apostles.
Eusebius treats it as he does James, and Luther, followed
by many modern conservative scholars (among them. Neander),
rejects it.
Its defenders commonly ascribe it to Jude, the brother of
the Lord, in distinction from Jude the apostle, and put its composi:
tion before the destruction of Jerusalem. The advanced critical
school unanimously deny its authenticity, and most of them throw
its composition into the second century, although some put it back
into the latter part of the first.

from the effects of a kick given her by Nero while she was with

3. łoś. AAos. V.

* We learn from Tacitus, Ann. XV. 39, that Nero was suspected
to be the author of the great Roman conflagration, which took place
in 64 A.D. (Pliny, H. M. XVII. 1, Suetonius, 38, and Dion Cassius,
LXII. 18, state directly that he was the author of it), and that to
avert this suspicion from himself he accused the Christians of the
deed, and the terrible Neronian persecution which Tacitus describes
so fully was the result. Gibbon, and in recent times especially Schil
ler (Geschichte der Römischen Kaisergeit unter der Regierung
des Mero, p. 584 sqq.), have maintained that Tacitus was mistaken
in callin di. a persecution of Christians, which was rather a perse
cution .#. Jews as a whole.
But we have no reason for impeach
ing Tacitus' accuracy in this case, especially since we remember
that the Jews enjoyed favor with Nero through his wife Poppaea.
What is very significant, Josephus is entirely silent in regard to a
persecution of his countrymen under Nero. We may assume as
probable (with Ewald and Renan) that it was through the sugges
tion of the Jews that Nero's attention was drawn to the Christians,
and he was led to throw the guilt upon them, as a people whose
habits would best give countenance to such a suspicion, and most
easily excite the rage of the populace against them. This was not
a persecution of the Christians in the strict sense, that is, it was not
aimed against their religion as such; and yet it assumed such pro
portions and was attended with such horrors that it always lived in
the memory of the Church as the first and one of the most awful of
a long line of persecutions instituted against them by imperial Rome,
and it revealed to them the essential conflict which existed between
Rome as it then was and Christianity.
* The Greek translator ofon's AAology, whoever he may
have been (certainly not Eusebius himself; see chap. 2, note 9,
above), being ignorant of the Latin idiom cum marine, has made
very bad work of this sentence, and has utterly destroyed the sense
of the original, which runs as follows: ific reperiotis primum
Averonem in hanc sectant cum marime Romae orientern Caesa
riano gladio serocosse ("There you will find that Nero was the
first to assail with the imperial sword the Christian sect, which was
then especially flourishing in Rome"). The Greek translation
reads: oxei euphorete mporov Nepova rooro to Soyua, ovika uáAvata
** "Paum Thy divaroany magav wrotáš is duos ov eis mavras, 8to
$orta, in the rendering of which I have followed Cruse, who has re
produced the idea of the Greek translator with as much fidelity as
the sentence will allow. The German translators, Stroth and Closs,
render, the sentence directly from the original Latin, and thus pre
serve the meaning of*. which is, of course, what the Greek
translator intended to reproduce.
I have not, however, felt at lib
erty in the present case to follow their example.

* This tradition, that Paul suffered martyrdom in Rome, is early
and universal, and disputed by no counter-tradition, and may be
accepted as the one certain historical fact known about Paul outside
of the New Testament accounts. Clement (Ad. Car. chap. 5) is the
first to mention the death of Paul, and seems to imply, though he
does not directly state, that his death took place in Rome during
Caius (quoted below, § 7), a writer of
the persecution of Nero.

This
account of Peter and Paul is substantiated by the
fact that their names are preserved in the ceme

in Rome, as is also Dionysius of Corinth (quoted below, § 8) of the

second century), in his De Araescriptione Haer. chap. 36, is still
more distinct, recording that Paul was beheaded in §: Euse
bius, and Jerome accept this tradition unhesitatingly, and we may
do likewise. As a Roman citizen, we should expect him to meet
death by the sword.

* The tradition that Peter suffered martyrdom in Rome is as old
and as universal as that in regard to Paul, but owing to a great
amount of falsehood which became mixed with the original tradition
by the end of the second century the whole has been rejected as
untrue by some modern critics, who go so far as to deny that Peter
was ever at Rome. (See, especially Lipsius' Die ..., der
römischen Petrus-Sage, Kiel, 1872; a summary of his view is given
by Jackson in the Presbyterian £os'.oPrinceton Rezniew,
1876, p. 265 sq. . In Lipsius' latest work upon this subject, Die
Acta Pauli und. Petri, 1887, he makes important concessions.)
The tradition is, however, too strong to be set aside, and there is
absolutely no trace of any conflicting tradition. We may therefore
assume it as overwhelmingly probable that Peter was in Rome and
suffered martyrdom there. #. martyrdom is plainly referred to in
§ xxi. Io, though the place of it is not given. The first extra
iblical witness to it is Clement of Rome.
e also leaves the place
of the martyrdom unspecified (Ad Cor. 5), but he evidently as
sumes the place as well known, and indeed it is impossible that the
early Church could have known of the death of Peter and Paul
without knowing where they died, and there is in neither case a
single opposing tradition.
Ignatius (Ad Rom. chap. 4) connects
Paul and Peter in an especial way with the Roman Church, which
seems plainly to imply that Peter had been in Rome. Phlegon
(supposed to be the Emperor Hadrian writing under the name of a
favorite slave) is said by Origen (Contra Celsum, II. 14) to have
confused Jesus and Peter in his Chronicles. This is very signifi
cant as implying that Peter must have been well known in Rome.
Dionysius, quoted below, distinctly states that Peter labored in
Rome, and 3. is a witness for it. So Irenaeus, Clement, Tertul
lian, and later Fathers without a dissenting voice. The first to men
tion Peter's death by crucifixion (unless j. xxi. 18 be *::::::
to imply it) is Tertullian (De Praescrip. Haer. chap. 36), but he
mentions it as a fact already known, and tradition since #. time is
so unanimous in regard to it that we may consider it in the highest
degree probable. On the tradition reported by Origen, that Peter
was crucified head downward, see below, Bk. III. chap. 1, where
Origen is quoted by Eusebius.

* The history of Caius is veiled in obscurity.

All that we know
of him is that he was a very learned ecclesiastical writer, who at
the beginning of the third century held a disputation with Proclus in
Rome (cf. Bk. VI. chap. 20, ... The accounts of him given
by Jerome, Theodoret, and Nicephorus are drawn from Eusebius
and furnish us no new data.
Photius, however (Bibl. XLVIII.),
reports that Caius was said to have been a presbyter of the Roman
Church during the episcopates of Victor and Zephyrinus, and to
have been elected "Bishop of the Gentiles," and hence he is com
monly spoken of as a presbyter of the Roman Church, though the
tradition rests certainly upon a very slender soundation, as Photius
lived some six hundred years after Caius, and is the first to mention
the fact.
Photius also, although with hesitation, ascribes to Caius a
work. On the Cause of the Universe, and one called The Laby
rinth, and another Against the Heres { Artemon (see below,
Bk. V. chap. 28, note 1). The first of these (and by some the
last also), is now commonly ascribed to Hippolytus. Though the
second may have been written by Caius it is no longer extant, and
hence all that we have of his writings are the fragments of the
Dialogue with Procłus preserved by Eusebius in this chapter and
in Bk. III. chaps. 28, 31. The absence of any notice of the personal
activity of so distinguished a writer has led some critics (e.g. Salmon
in Smith and Wace, I. p. 386, who refers to Lightfoot, journal of
Philology, I. 98, as holding the same view) to assume the identity
of Caius and Hippolytus, supposing that o: in the Dia
logue with Proclus styled himself simply by his praenomen Caius,
and that thus as the book sell into the hands of strangers the tradi
tion arose of a writer Caius who in reality never had a separate exist:
ence. This theory is ingenious, and in many respects plausible, and
certainly cannot be disproved (owing chiefly to our lack of knowledge
about Caius), and yet in the absence of any proof that Hippolytus ac
tually bore the praenomen Caius it can be o: as no more than a
bare hypothesis. The two are distinguished by Eusebius, and by all
the writers who mention them. On Caius' attitude toward the Apoc;
alypse, see Bk. III. chap. 28, note 4; and on his opinion in regard
to the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews, see Bk. VI, chap.
20, and Bk. III, chap. 3, note 17. The fragments of Caius (includ
ing fragments from the Little £og. mentioned above) are
given with annotations in Routh's Roo. Sacra", II. 125-158, and in
translation (with the addition of the Muratorian Fragment, wrongly
ascribed to Caius by its discoverer) in the Ante-Vicene Fathers,

* This Proclus probably introduced Montanism into Rome at
the beginning of the third century.
According to Pseudo-Tertullian
(Adv. outncs, Harr. chap. 7) he was a leader of one division of the
Montanists, the other division being composed of followers of AFs
chines. He is probably to be identified with the Proctors froster,
classed by Tertullian, in Adro. I al., chap. 5, with Justin Martyr,
Miltiades, and Irenaeus as a successful opponent of heresy.

* The sect of the Montanists.

Called the "Phrygian heresy,"
from the fact that it took its rise in Phrygia. Upon Montanism,
see below, Bk. IV. chap. 27, and especially Bk. V, chap. 16 sqq.

* The or here makes it probable that Caius, in reply to certain
claims of Proclus, was asserting over against him the ability of the
Roman church to exhibit the true trophies of the greatest of all the
apostles. And what these claims of Proclus were can perhaps be
gathered from his words, quoted by Eusebius in Bk. III. chap. 31,
§ 4, in which Philip and his daughters are said to have been buried
in Hierapolis. That these two sentences were closely connected in
the original is quite possible.

* According to an ancient tradition, Peter was crucified upon the
hill of Janiculum, near the Vatican, where the Church of San Pietro
in Montorio now stands, and the hole in which his cross stood is
still shown to the trustful visitor. A more probable tradition makes
the scene of execution the Vatican hill, where Nero's circus was,
and where the persecution took place.
Baronius makes the whole
ridge on the right bank of the Tiber one hill, and thus reconciles
the two traditions.
In the fourth century the remains of Peter were
transferred from the Catacombs of San Sebastiano (where they are
said to have been interred in 258 A.D.) to the Basilica of St. Peter,
which occupied the sight of the present basilica on the Vatican.

* Paul was beheaded, according to tradition, on the Ostian way,
at the spot now occupied by the Abbey of the Three Fountains.
The sountains, which are said to have sprung up at the spots where
Paul's head struck the ground three times after the decapitation, are
still shown, as also the pillar to which he is supposed to have been
bound !
In the fourth century, at the same time that Peter's remains
were transferred to the Vatican, Paul's remains are said to have been
buried in the Basilica of St. Paul, which occupied the site now marked

probable in the traditions as to the spot where Paul and Peter met
their death. They are as old as the second century; and while they
cannot be accepted as indisputably true (since there is always a ten
dency to fix theo of a great man even if it is not known),
yet on the other, hand if Peter and Paul were martyred in Rome,
it is hardly possible that the place of their death and burial could
have been forgotten by the Roman church itself within a century
and a half.

17 Neither Paul nor Peter founded the Roman church in the
strict sense, for there was a congregation of believers there even
before Paul came to Rome, as his Epistle to the Romans shows,
and Peter cannot have reached there until some time after Paul.
It was, however, a very early fiction that Paul and Peter together
founded the church in that city.

martyrdom at Rome, he is almost certainly in error in speaking as
he does of Peter's work in Corinth.
It is difficult, to be sure, to dis
pose of so direct and early a tradition, but it is still more difficult to
accept it. The statement that Paul and Peter together planted the
Corinthian church is certainly an error, as we know that it was
Paul's own church, founded by him alone. The so-called Cephas
party, mentioned in 1 Cor. i., is perhaps easiest explained by the
previous presence and activity of Peter in Corinth, but this is by no
means necessary, and the absence of any reference to the fact in the
two epistles of #. renders it almost absolutely impossible.
It is
barely possible, though by no means, probable, that Peter visited
Corinth on his way to Rome (assuming the Roman journey) and
that thus, Ao the church had already been founded many
years, he became connected in tradition with its early days, and
finally with its origination.
But it is more probable that the tradi
tion is wholly in error and arose, as Neander suggests, partly from
the mention of Peter in 1 Cor. i., partly from the natural desire to
ascribe the origin of this great apostolic church to the two leading
apostles, to whom in like manner the founding of the Roman church
was ascribed. It is significant that this tradition is recorded only
by a Corinthian, who of course had every inducement to accept
such a report, and to repeat it in comparing his own church with
the central church of Christendom. W. find no mention of the
tradition in later writers, so far as I am aware.

Dionysius is
the first one to connect the deaths of Peter and Paul chronologically,
but later it became quite the custom. One tradition put their deaths
on the same day, one year apart (Augustine and Prudentius, e.g., are
to state joy that they suffered on the same day.
Jerome (de vior. fol. 1) is the first
said to support this tradition).
Eusebius in

shield himself from the consequences of his misrule and of his abomi

Rome by acting still more cruelly toward them.
As a result many
disturbances broke out, and many bitter things were said against
Florus, in consequence of which he proceeded to the severe measures
referred to here by Eusebius.

Josephus gives the whole number of those

thirty-six hundred (no doubt a gross exaggeration, like most of his

whipped and crucified. The "myriads" of Eusebius is an instance
of the exaggerated use of language which was common to his age,
and which almost invariably marks a period of decline.
In many
cases "myriads" meant to łoń. and his contemporaries twenty,

* According to Lipsius, the legends concerning the labors of
the apostles in various countries were all originally connected with
that of their separation at Jerusalem, which is as old as the second
century.
But this separation was put at various dates by different
traditions, varying from immediately after the Ascension to twenty
four years later. A lost book, referred to by the Peoretum Goias if
as Liber our appellatus sortes .4/ostelorum apocry//orts, very likely
contained the original tradition, and an account of the sate of the apos
tles, and was probably of Gnostic or Manichean origin. The efforts
to derive from the varying traditions any trustworthy particulars as
to the apostles themselves is almost wholly vain. The various tradi

Lipsius states that, according to
the oldest form of the tradition, the apostles were divided into three
groups: first, Peter and Andrew, Matthew and Bartholomew, who
were said to have preached in the region of the Black Sea; second,
Thomas, Thaddeus, and Simeon, the Canaanite, in Parthia; third,
John and Philip, in Asia Minor.

Rufinus (H. E. l I. 5) and Socrates (//. E. IV. 18) speak of Edessa

Later traditions extended his labors eastward
as far as India, and made him suffer martyrdom in that land; and
there his remains were exhibited down to the sixteenth century.
According to the Martyrou mt Roman won, however, his remains
were brought from India to Edessa, and from thence to Ortona, in
Italy, during the Crusades. The Syrian Christians in India called
themselves Thomas-Christians; but the name cannot be traced be
yond the eighth century, and is derived, probably, from a Nestorian
missionary.

* The name Scythia was commonly used by the ancients, in a
very loose sense, to denote all the region lying north of the Cas
pian and Black Seas.
But two Scythias were distinguished in more
accurate usage: a European Scythia, lying north of the Black Sea,
between the Danube and the Tanais, and an Asiatic Scythia, extend
ing eastward from the Ural. The former is here meant.
* The traditions o: Andrew are very uncertain and con
tradictory, though, as remarked above (note 1), the original form,
represented here, assigned as his field the region in the neighborhood
of the Black Sea.
His traditional activity in Scythia has made him
the patron saint of Russia. He is also called the patron saint of
Greece, where he is reported to have been crucified; but his activity
there rests upon a late tradition.
His body is said to have been car
ried to Constantinople in 357 (cf. Philostorgius, Hist. Eccles. III.
2), and during the Crusades transferred to Amalpae in Italy, in
whose cathedral the remains are still shown. Andrew is in addition
the patron saint of Scotland; but the tradition of his activity there
dates back only to the eighth century (cf. Skene's Celtic Scot
!a staf, II. 221 sq.). Numerous other regions are claimed, by various
traditions, to have been the scene of his labors.

" The universal testimony of antiquity assigns John's later life
1 and 3. 4, etc.;
to Ephesus: , e.g. Irenaeus, Adv. Harr. III. I.
Clement of Alex., Qui's 101 wes Salzwetur, c. 42 (quoted by Eusebius,
chap. 23, below); Polycrates in his Epistle ..". (quoted by
Eusebius in chap. 31, below, and in Bk. V. chap. 24); and many
others. The testimony of Irenaeus is oil. weighty, for the
series: Irenaeus, the pupil of Polycarp, the pupil of j. forms a
complete chain such as we have in no other case.
Such testimony,
when its force is broken by no adverse tradition, ought to be suffi
cient to establish John's residence in Ephesus beyond the shadow of
a doubt, but it has been denied by many of the critics who reject
the Johannine authorship of the fourth Gospel (e.g. Keim, Holtz
mann, the author of Supernat. Religion, and others), though the
denial is much less positive now than it was a few years ago. The
chief arguments urged against the residence of John in Ephesus are
two, both a silentio
first, Clement in his first Epistle to the Cor
inthians speaks of the apostles, in such a way as to seem to imply
that they were all dead; secondly, in the Ignatian Fpistles, Paul is
mentioned, but not John, which is certainly very remarkable, as
one is addressed to Ephesus itself.
In reply it may be said that such
an interpretation of Clement's words is not necessary, and that the
omission of John in the epistles of Ignatius becomes persectly nat
ural if the Epistles are thrown into the time of Hadrian or into the
latter part of Trajan's reign, as they ought to be (cf. chap. 36, note 4).
In the face of the strong testimonyo Ephesian residence
these two objections must be overruled. The traditional view is
defended by | conservative critics as well as by the majority even
of those who deny the Johannine authorship of the fourth Gospel (cf.
especially, Hilgenfeld in his Einleitung, and Weizsäcker in his
Apostoličhes Zestalter). The silence of Paul's epistles and of the
Acts proves that John cannot have gone to Ephesus until after Paul
had permanently left there, and this, we should naturally expect to
be the case. Upon the time of John's banishment to Patmos, see

* The language of Origen (xexmpuxeval soukev, instead of Aðyos
exes or Tapaboo is meptext) seems to imply that he is recording not
a tradition, but a conclusion drawn from the first Epistle of Peter,
which was known to him, and in which these places are mentioned.
Such a tradition did, however, exist quite early. Cf. e.g. the Syriac
Doctrina AAostelorum, (ed. Cureton) and the Gnostic Acts of
Peter and Andrew. The former assigns to Peter, Antioch, Syria,
and Cilicia, in addition to Galatia and Pontus, and cannot, therefore,

* Five provinces of Asia Minor, mentioned in 1 Pet. i. 1.

It is of course not impossible, but the absence of any reference to
it by earlier Fathers (even by Tertullian, who mentions the cruci
fixion), and its decidedly legendary character, render it exceedingly
doubtful.

* The actual order of the first three so-called bishops of Rome is
a greatly disputed matter. The oldest tradition is that given by
Irenaeus (Adz'. Harr. III. 3. 3) and followed here by Eusebius, ac
cording to which the order was Linus, Anencletus, Clement. Hip
F. gives a different order, in which he is followed by many
"athers; and in addition to these two chief arrangements | possi
ble combinations of the three names, and all sorts of theories to ac
count for the difficulties and to reconcile the discrepancies in the
earlier lists, have been proposed.
In the second chapter of the so
called Epistle of Clement to James (a part of the Pseudo-Clemen
tine Literature prefixed to the Home ićies) it is said that Clement was
ordained by Peter, and Salmon thinks that this caused Hippolytus
to change the order, putting Clement first.
Gieseler (A·ccles. Hist.,
Eng. Trans, I. p. 107, note to) explains the disagreements in the
various traditions by supposing that the three were presbyters to
gether at Rome, and that later, in the endeavor to make out a com
plete list of bishops, they were each successively elevated by tradi
tion to the episcopal chair.
It is at least certain that Rome at that
early date had no monarchical bishop, and therefore the ques
tion as to the order of these first three so-called bishops is not a
question as to a fact, but simply as to which is the oldest of various

* The testimony of tradition is unanimous for the authenticity of
the first Epistle of Peter. . It was known to Clement of Rome, Poly
carp, Papias, Hermas, &c. (the Muratorian Fragment, however,
omits it), and was cited under the name of Peter by Irenaeus, Ter
tullian, and Clement of Alexandria, from whose time its canonicity
and Petrine authorship were established, so that Eusebius rightly
puts it oil. Aomologoumena.
Semler, in 1784, was the first
to deny its direct Petrine authorship, and Cludius, in 1808, pro
nounced it absolutely ungenuine. The Tübingen School followed,
and at the present time the genuineness is denied by all the negative
critics, chiefly on account of the strong Pauline character of the
epistle (cf. Holtzmann, Einleitung, p. 487 sqq., also Weiss, Ein
Protong, p. 428 sqq., who confines the resemblances to the Epistles
to the Romans and to the Ephesians, and denies the general Pauline
character of the epistle). #. great majority of scholars, however,
maintain the Petrine authorship. A new opinion, expressed by
Harnack, upon the assumption of the distinctively Pauline charac.
ter of the epistle, is that it was written during the apostolic age by
some follower of Paul, and that the name of Peter was afterward at.
tached to it, so that it represents no sraud on the part of the writer,

nape. Anobauev. The authorship of
the second Epistle of Peter has always been widely disputed. The
external testimony for it is very weak, as no knowledge of it can be
proved to have existed before the third century. Numerous expla
nations have been offered by apologists to account for this curious
fact; but it still remains almost inexplicable, if the epistle be ac
cepted as the work of the apostle. . The first clear references to it
are made by Firmilian, Bishop of Caesarea in o (third
century), in his Epistle to Cyprian, $6. (Ep. 74, in the collection of
Cyprian's Epistles, Ante-Mscene Fathers,
... ed., V. p. 391), and
by Origen (quoted by Eusebius, VI. 25, below), who mentions the
second Epistle as disputed.
Clement of Alexandria, however, seems
at least to have known and used it (according to Euseb. VI. 14).
The epistle was not admitted into the Canon until the Council of
Hippo, in 393, when all doubts, and discussion ceased until the
Reformation.
It is at present disputed by all negative critics, and
even by many otherwise conservative scholars. Those who de
send its genuineness date it shortly before the death of Peter, while the
majority of those who reject it throw it into the second century, -
some as late as the time of Clement of Alexandria (e.g. Harnack, in
his Lehre der Zwölf Apostel, p. 15 and 159, who assigns its com:

sition to Egypt).

* Although disputed by many, as already remarked, and conse
quently not looked upon as certainly canonical until the end of the
fourth century, the epistle was yet used, as Eusebius says, quite
widely from the time of Origen on, e.g. by Origen, Firmilian, Cy
prian, Hippolytus, Methodius, etc. . The same is true, however, of
other writings, which the Church afterward placed among the Apoc
ha.P These mpáčets (or meptodot, as they are often called) IIerpov
were of heretical origin, according to Lipsius, and belonged, like the
heretical Acta Pauli (referred to in note 20, below), to the collec
tion of meptočot tow amoa Toxov, which were ascribed to Lucius
Charinus, and, like them, formed also, from the end of the fourth
century, a part of the Manichean Canon of the New Testament.
The work, as a whole, is no longer extant, but a part of it is pre
served, according to flipsius, in a late Catholic redaction, under the
title Passio Petri. Upon these Acts of Peter, their original form,
and their relation to other works of the same class, see Lipsius
Like the heretical
Apocryphen Apostelgeschichten, II. 1, p. 78 sq.
Acta Pauli already referred to, this work, too, was used in the
composition of the Catholic Acts of Paul and Peter, which are still
extant, and which assumed their present form in the fifth century,
according to Lipsius. These Catholic Acts of Peter, and Paul
have been published by Thilo (Acta Petri et Pauli, Halle; 1837),
and by Tischendorf, in his Acta Apost. A focr., p. Šiš. English
translation in the Ante-Nicene Fathers (Am. ...'. VIII. p. 477.

* This Gospel is mentioned by Serapion as in use in the church
of Rhossus (quoted by Eusebius, Bk. VI. chap. 12, below), but was
rejected by him because of the heretical doctrines which it contained.
It is mentioned again by Eusebius, III. 25, only to be rejected as
heretical; also by Origen (in Matt. Vol. X. 17) and by Jerome (d.
zor. ill. 1), who follows Eusebius in pronouncing it an heretical
work employed by no early teachers of *: Christian Church.
Lip;
sius regards it as probably a Gnostic recast of one of the Canonical
Gospels. From Serapion's account of this Gospel (see below, Bk.
VI. chap. 12), we see that it differs from the Canonical Gospels, not
in denying their truth, or in giving a contradictory account of
Christ's life, but rather in adding to the account given by them.
This, of course, favors Lipsius' hypothesis; and in any case, he is
certainly quite right in denying that the Gospel was an original work
made use of by Justin Martyr, and that it in any way lay at the base
of our present Gospel of Mark. The Gospel (as we learn from the
saille J. was used by the Docetae, but that does not o that
it contained what we call Docetic ideas of Christ's body (cf. note.8
on that chapter). The Gospel is no longer extant.

Paul's fourteen epistles are well known

Preaching of Peter and Paul (cf. Clement of Alexandria, Strome.
VI. i. and Lactantius, /ust. IV. 21).
It was mentioned frequently
by the early Fathers, and a number of fragments of it have been
preserved by Clement of Alexandria, who quotes it frequently as a
genuine record of Peter's teaching. (The fragments are collected
by Grabe in his Spic. Patr. I. 55-71, and by Hilgenfeld in his M. T.
crora Can. rec., 2d ed., IV. p. 51 sqq.). It is mentioned twice by
Origen (in Johan. XIII. 17, and De Princ. Praes. 8), and in the
latter place is o classed among spurious works.
It was
probably, according to Lipsius, closely connected with the Acts of
f'eter and Paul mentioned in note 6, above. Lipsius, however, re
gards those Acts as a Catholic adaptation of a work originally Ebi
onitic, though he says expressly that the Preaching is not at all of
that character, but is a Petro-Pauline production, and is to be dis
tinguished from the Ebionitic knpuyuata.
It would seem therefore
that he must put the Preaching later than the original of the 4 cts,
into a time when the Ebionitic character of the latter had been done
Salmon meanwhile holds that the Preach ong is as old
away with.
as the middle of the second century and the most ancient of the
works recording Peter's preaching, and hence (if this view be ac
cepted) the Ebionitic character which Lipsius ascribes to the Acts
did not (if it existed at all) belong to the original form of the record
of Peter's preaching embodied in the Acts and in the Preach ons.
The latter (if it included also the Preaching of Paul, as seems al
most certain) appears to have contained an account of some of the
events of the life of Christ, and it may have been used by Justin.
Compare the remarks of Lipsius in §e Dict. of Christ. Biog. I.
p. 28 (Cath. Adaptations of Ebionitic Acts), and Salmon's article
on the Preaching of Peter, ibid. IV. 329.
* The Apoca o: of Peter o considerable favor in the
carly Church and was accepted by some Fathers as a genuine
work of the apostle.
It is mentioned in the Muratorian Fragment
in connection with the Apocalypse of John, as a part of the Roman
Canon, and is accepted by the author of the fragment himself; al
though he %. that some at that time rejected it. Clement of Alexan
dria, in his //yootypeses (according to Eusebius, IV.14, below), com
mented upon it, thus showing that it belonged at that time to the
Alexandrian Canon. . It the third century it was still received in the
North African Church (so Harnack, who refers to the stichometry
of the Codex Claramontanus). The Eclogae or Prophetical Sã.
!ections of Clement of Alexandria give it as a genuine work of Peter
(§§ 41, 48, }. p. 1000 sq., Potter's ed.), and so Methodius of Tyre
(Synoos. XI. 6, p. 16, ed. Jahn, according to Lipsius). After Euse
bius' time the work seems to have been oil. regarded as spuri
ous, and thus, as its canonicity depended upon its apostolic origin
(see chap; 24, note 19), it gradually fell out of the Canon.
It never.
theless held its place for centuries among the semi-scriptural books,
and was read in many churches. .
. According to Sozomen, //. E.
VII. 19, it was read at Easter, which shows that it was treated with
especial respect. Nicephorus in his Stichometry puts it among the
Antilegomena, in immediate connection with the Apocalypse of
John.
As Lipsius remarks, its "lay-recognition in orthodox circles
}. that it could not have had a Gnostic origin, nor otherwise
ave contained what was offensive to Catholic Christians" (see Lip
sius, Dict. of Christ. Biog, I., p. 130 sqq.). Only a few fragments

Epistle to the Hebrews. These formed for Eusebius an absolutely
undisputed part of the Canon (cf. chap. 25, below, where he speaks
of them §§ the same complete assurance), and were universally
accepted until the present century. The external testimony for all
of them is ample, going back (the Pastoral Epistles excepted) to
the early part of the second century. The Epistles to the Romans,
Corinthians, and Galatians have never been disputed (except by
an individual here and there, especially during the last few years
in Holland), even the Tübingen School accepting them as genuine
works of Paul. The other epistles have not fared so well. The
enuineness of Fphesians was first questioned by Usteri in 1824 and
i. Wette in 1826, and the Tübingen School rejected it. Schol

17 reves #6ernxaal. That the Epistle to the Hebrews was not
written by Paul is now commonly acknowledged, and may be re
arded as absolutely certain.
It does not itself lay any claim to
auline authorship; its theology and style are both non-Pauline;
and finally, external, testimony is strongly against its direct con:
nection with Paul. The first persons to assign the epistle to Paul
are Pantaenus and Clement of Alexandria (see below, Bk. VI. chap.
14), and they evidently find it necessary to defend its Pauline au

thorship in the face of the objections of others.
assumes a Hebrew original, which was translated into Greek by
Luke.
Origen (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 25) leaves its authorship
undecided, but thinks it probable that the thoughts are Paul's, but
the diction that of some one else, who has recorded what he heard
from the apostle. He then remarks that one tradition assigned it to
Clement of Rome, another to Luke.
Eusebius himself, in agree
ment with the Alexandrians (who, with the exception of Origen,
unanimously accept the Pauline authorship), looks upon it as a work
of Paul, but accepts Clement of Alexandria's theory that it was
written in Hebrew, and thinks it probable that Clement of Rome
was its translator (see chap. 38, below).
In the Western Church,
where the epistle was known very early (e.g. Clement of Rome uses
it freely), it is not connected with Paul until the fourth century.
Indeed, Tertullian (de Azodicit. 20) states that it bore the name of
Barnabas, and evidently had never heard that it had been ascribed
to any one else. The influence of the Alexandrians, however, finally
prevailed, and from the fifth century on we find it universally ac
&epted, both East and West, as an epistle of Paul, and not until the
Reformation was its origin again questioned.
Since that time its
authorship has been commonly regarded as an insoluble mystery.
Numerous guesses have been made (e.g. Luther guessed Apollos,
and he has been followed by many), but it is impossible to prove
that any of them are correct. For Barnabas, however, more can
be said than for any of the others.
Tertullian expressly connects
the epistle with him; and its contents are just what we should ex
pect from the pen of a Levite who had been for a time under Paul's
influence, and yet had not received his Christianity from him; its
standpoint, in fact, is Levitic, and decidedly non-Pauline, and yet
reveals in many places the influence of Pauline ideas.
Still further,
it is noticeable that in the place where the Epistle to the Hebrews is
first ascribed to Paul, there first appears an epistle which is ascribed
(quite wrongly: see below, chap. 25, note zo) to Barnabas. May it
not be (as has been suggested by Weiss and others) that the anony
mous Epistle to the Hebrews was originally accepted in Alexandria
as the work of Barnabas, but that later it was ascribed to Paul; and
that the tradition that Barnabas had written an epistle, which must
still have remained in the Church, led to the ascription of another
anonymous epistle to him? We seem thus most easily to explain the
false ascription of the one epistle to Paul, and the false ascription of the
other to Barnabas. It may be said that the claims of both Barnabas and
Apollos have many supporters, while still more attempt no decision.
In regard to the canonicity of the epistle there seems newer to

that it was not written by Paul.
But what has

lived before our time I shall quote in the proper

I have not found them among the undisputed

But as the same apostle, in the saluta
tions at the end of the Epistle to the Ro

Hermas, to whom the book called The Shep
herd * is ascribed, it should be observed that

have been any serious dispute, and it is this fact doubtless which
did most to foster the i...} in its Pauline authorship from the third
century on.
For the criterion of canonicity more and more came to
be looked upon as apostolicity, direct or indirect. The early Church
had cared little for such a criterion.
In only one place does Eusebius
seem to imply that doubts existed as to its canonicity, - in Bk. VI.
chap. 13, where he classes it with the Book of Wisdom, and the Epis
tles of 3. Clement, and Jude, among the antises omena. But
in view of his treatment of it elsewhere it must be concluded that
he is thinking in that passage not at all of its canonicity, but of its
Pauline authorship, which he knows is disputed by some, and in
reference to which he uses the same word, a vri Aeyegoat, in the pres
ent sentence. Upon the canonicity of the epistle, see still further

* The Shepherd of Hermas was in circulation in the latter half
of the second century, and is quoted by Irenaeus (A do. A/aer. IV.
20. 2) as Scripture, although he omits it in his discussion of Scrip

Eusebius
in chap; 25 places it among the robot or spurious writings in connec
tion with the Acts of Paul and the AAocalypse of Peter. According
to the Muratorian Fragment, it was "written very recently in our
times in the city of Rome by Hermas, while his brother, Bishop
Pius, sat in the chair of the Church of Rome. And therefore it also
ought to be read; but it cannot be made public in the Church to the
people, nor placed anong the prophets, as their number is complete,
nor among the apostles to the end of time." . This shows the very
high esteem in which the work was held in that age.
It was very
widely employed in private and in public, both in the East and the
West, until about the fourth century, when it gradually passed out
of use. Jerome (de vir. ill. Io) says that it was almost unknown

this too has been disputed by some, and on
their account cannot be placed among the ac
knowledged books; while by others it is con
sidered quite indispensable, especially to those
who need instruction in the elements of the
faith.
Hence, as we know, it has been publicly
read in churches, and I have found that some
of the most ancient writers used it.

This will serve to show the divine writ
ings that are undisputed as well as those
that are not universally acknowledged.

among the Latins of his time, . As to the date and authorship of
the Shepherd opinions vary widely. The only direct testimony of
antiquity is that of the Muratorian Fragment, which says that it
was written by Hermas, the brother of Pius, during the episcopacy
of the latter (139-154 A.D.). This testimony is accepted by the
majority of scholars, most of whom date the book near the middle
of the second century, or at least as late as the reign of Hadrian.
This opinion received not long ago what was supposed to be a strong
confirmation from the discovery of the fact that Hermas in all proba
bility quoted from Theodotion's version of Daniel (see Hort's article
in the johns Hopkins University Circular, December, 1884), which
has been commonly ascribed to the second century.
But it must now
be admitted that no one knows the term in as a yrto for the compo
sition of Theodotion's version, and therefore £ discovery leaves
the date of Hermas entirely undetermined (see Schürer, Grsch. des
Jidischen lookes, II., p. 709); Meanwhile Eusebius in this con
nection records the tradition, which he had read, that the book was
written by the Hermas mentioned in Romans xvi.
This tradition,
however, appears to be no older than Origen, with whom it is no
more than a mere guess. While in our absence of any knowledge
as to this Hermas, we cannot absolutely disprove his claim (unless
we prove decisively the late date of the book), there is yet no ground
for accepting it other than a mere coincidence in a very common

appears very likely, it cannot be called certain in the face of evidence
Internal testimony helps us little, as
there is nothing in the book which may not have been written at
the very beginning of the second century, or, on the other hand, as
late as the middle of it. Zahn dates it between 97 and 1co, and
assigns it to an unknown Herinas, a contemporary of the Roman

an apocalypse, written for the purpose of reforming the life of the
Church, which seemed to the author to have become very corrupt.
The work (especially the last part) is in the form of an allegory,
and has been compared to the Pilgrim's Progress.
Opinions are
divided as to whether it is actually founded upon visions and dreams
of the author, or is wholly a fiction. The former opinion seems to
be the more probable.

Until recent years only a Latin translation of Hermas was known.

being based upon a Mt. Athos MS. discovered shortly before by
Simonides.

THAT Paul preached to the Gentiles and

Peter

But the number and the names of
those among them that became true and
apostles, and were
zealous followers of the
judged worthy to tend the churches founded by
them, it is not easy to tell, except those
mentioned in the writings of Paul.
For he
had innumerable fellow-laborers, or "fel
low-soldiers," as he called them," and most of
them were honored by him with an imperishable
memorial, for he gave enduring testimony
concerning them in his own epistles. Luke
also in the Acts speaks of his friends, and
mentions them by name."

* That Timothy was the first bishop of Ephesus is stated also by
the Apost. Const. (VII. 46), and by Nicephorus (H. P. III. 11),
who records (upon what authority we do not know) that he suffered
martyrdom under Domitian.
Against the tradition that he labored
during his later years in Ephesus there is nothing to be urged; though
on the other hand the evidence for it amounts to little, as it seems to
no more than a conclusion drawn from the Epistles to Timothy, though
hardly a conclusion drawn by Eusebius himself, for he uses the word
to ropetrat, which seems to imply that he had some authority for his
statement.
According to those epistles, he was at the time of their
çomposition in Ephesus, though they give us no hint as to whether
he was afterward there or not. From Heb. xiii. 23 (the date of
which we do not know) we learn that he had just been released from
some imprisonment, apparently in Italy, but whither he afterward
went is quite uncertain.
Eusebius' report that he was bishop of
Ephesus is the customary but unwarranted carrying back into the
first century of the monarchical episcopate which was not known

othy and John were bishops of Ephesus, the former appointed by
Paul, the latter by himself. Timothy is a saint in the Roman Catholic
sense, and is commemorated January 24.

* Cf. Tit. i. 5.

Titus is commonly connected by tradition with
Crete, of which he is supposed to have been the first bishop, - the
later institution being again pushed back into the first century. In
the fragment de I to et Actis Tito, by the lawyer Zenas (in Fabric.
Cod. Apoc. N. T. II. 831 sqq., according to Howson, in Smith's 19trf.
of the Bio/e), he is said to have been bishop of Gortyna, a city of
Crete (where still stand the ruins of a church which bears his name),
and of a royal Cretan family by birth. This tradition is late, and,
of course, of little authority, but at the same time, accords very
well with all that we know of Titus; and consequently there is no
reason for of in toto.
According to 2 Tim. iv. 10, he went,
or was sent, into Dalmatia; but universal tradition ascribes his later
Candia, the modern capital, claims the
life and his death to Cretc.

But Luke," who was of Antiochian parentage and a physician by profession," and
who was especially intimate with Paul and well
acquainted with the rest of the apostles," has
left us, in two inspired books, proofs of that
spiritual healing art which he learned from them.
One of these books is the Gospel," which he
testifies that he wrote as those who were from
the beginning eye-witnesses and ministers of the
word delivered unto him, all of whom, as he
says, he followed accurately from the first." The
other book is the Acts of the Apostles" which he

memorated January 4.

* Of Luke personally we know very little. He is not mentioned
in the Acts, and only three times in Paul's epistles (Col. iv. 14:
Philem. 24; 2 Tim. iv. 11), srom which passages we learn that he
was a physician, was one of Paul's fellow-workers, who was very
dear to him, and was with him during his last imprisonment.
Ire
naeus, who is the first to ascribe the third Gospel and the Acts to this
Luke, seems to know nothing more about him personally. Euse
bius is the first to record ...i. was born at Antioch; but the tradi
tion must have been universally accepted in his day, as he states it
without any misgivings and with no qualifying phrase, . Jerome (de
zor. o. 7) and manyi. writers follow Eusebius in this statement.
There is no intrinsic improbability in the tradition, which seems, in
fact, to be favored by certain minor notices in the Acts (see Schaff,
Ch. Hist. I. 651).
Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. 25) says that he
labored in Achaia, and in Orat. 4 he calls him a martyr. Jerome
(ford.) says that he was buried in Constantinople.
According to
Nicephorus (H. E. II. 43) and later writers, Luke was a painter of
great skill; but this late tradition, of which the earlier Fathers know
nothing, is quite worthless.
Epiphanius (Haer. II. 11) makes him
one of the Seventy, which does not accord with Luke's own words
at the beginning of his Gospel, where he certainly implies that he
himself was not an eye-witness of the events which he records.
In
the same connection, Epiphanius says that he labored in Dalmatia,
Gallia, Italy, and Macedonia, - a tradition which has about as much
worth as most such traditions in regard to the fields of labor of the
various apostles and their followers.
Theophylact (On Lake xxiv.
13-24) records that some supposed that he was one of the disciples
with whom Christ walked to Emmaus, and this ingenious but un
founded guess has gained some modern supporters (e.g. Lange).
He is a saint in the Roman Catholic sense, and is commemorated
October 18.

* See Col. iv. 14.

11. Of Luke's acquaintance with the other apostles we know
nothing, although, if we suppose him to have been the author of the
"We'' sections in the Acts, he was with Paul in Jerusalem at the
time he was taken prisoner (Acts xxi.), when he met James at least,
and possibly others of the Twelve.
It is not at all improbable that
in the course of his life he became acquainted with several of the
apostles.
** The testimony to the cristence of our third Gospel, although
it is not so old as that for Matthew and Mark, is †: early.
It was used by Marcion, who based upon it his own mutilated gos
pel, and is quoted very frequently by Justin Martyr. The Gospel
is first distinctly ascribed to Luke by Irenaeus (III. I. 1) and by the
Muratorian Fragment.
From that time on tradition was unanimous
both as to its authorship and its authority. The common opinion -
still defended by the great majority of conservative critics - has
always been that the third Gospel was written before the destruction
of Jerusalem. The radical critics of the present century, however,
bring its composition down to a latter date-ranging all the way
from 79 to 140 (the latter is Baur's date, which is now universally
recognized as very wild). Many conservative critics put its compo
sition after the destruction of Jerusalem on account of the peculiar
form of its eschatological discourses - e.g. Weiss, who puts it be
tween 70 and 80 (while putting Matthew and Mark before the
destruction of Jerusalem). The traditional and still prevalent opin
ion is that Luke's Gospel was written later than those of Matthew
and Mark. See the various commentaries and New Testament
Introductions, and for a clear exhibition of the synoptical problem
in general, see Schaff's Ch. Hist. I. p. 697 sqq. On Luke in partic
ular, p. 648 sqq.
14 Traces }, knowledge of the Acts are found in the Apostolic
Fathers, in Justin, and in Tatian, and before the end of the second
century the book occupied a place in the Canon, undisputed except
by heretics, such as the Marcionites, Manicheans, &c. The Mura
torian Fragment and Irenaeus (III. 14) are the first to mention Luke
as the author of the Acts, but from that time on tradition has been
unanimous in ascribing it to him. The only exception occurs in the
case of Photius (ad - 1 1/1// so. Orozest. 123, ed. Migne), who states
that the work was ascribed by some to Clement, by others to Barna
bas, and by others to Luke; but it is probable, as Weiss remarks,
that Photius, in this case, confuses the Acts with the Epistle to the
Hebrews. As to the date of its composition, Irenaeus (III. I. 1)
seems (one cannot speak with certainty, as some have done) to put

it after the death of Peter and Paul, and therefore, necessarily, the
Acts still later. The Muratorian Fragment implies that the work
was written at least after the death of Peter.
Later, however, the
tradition arose that the work was written during the lifetime of Paul
(so Jerome, de zor. ii. 7), and this has been i. prevailing opinion
among conservative scholars ever since, although many put the
composition between the death of Paul and the destruction of Jeru
salem; while some (e.g. Weiss) put it aster the destruction of Jeru
salem, though still assigning it to Luke. The opposite school of
critics deny Luke's .." ip, throwing the book into the latter
part of the first century (Scholten, Hilgenfeld, &c.), or into the times
of Trajan and Hadrian (e.g. Volkmar, Keim, Hausrath, &c.). The
Tübingen School saw in the Acts a "tendency-writing," in which
the history was intentionally perverted.
This theory finds few
supporters at present, even among the most extreme critics, all of
whom, however, consider the book a source of the second rank,
containing much that is legendary and distorted and irreconcilable
with Paul's Epistles, which are looked upon as the only reliable
source. The question turns upon the relation of the author of the
"we" sections to the editor of the whole.
Conservative scholars
agree with universal tradition in identifying them (though this is
not necessary, in order to maintain the historical accuracy of the
work), while the opposite school denies the identity, considering the
"we" sections authentic historical accounts from the pen of a
companion of Paul, which were afterward incorporated into a larger
work by one who was not a pupil of Paul. The identity of the
author of the third Gospel and of the Acts is now admitted by all
parties.

Schaff (Ch. Hist. I. p. 649)
says that Origen also thus interpreted the passages in Romans and
Timothy referred to, but he gives no references, and I have not
been able to find in Origen's works anything to confirm the state
ment. Indeed, in commenting upon the passages in the Epistle to
the Romans he takes the words "my Gospel " to refer to the gospel

owever, ** in the passage from his Commentary on Matthew,

tation of the words "according to my Gospel," which Euse
bius represents as common in his day, is adopted also by Jerome
(afe zor. ii!. chap. 7), but is a gross exegetical blunder.
Paul
never uses the word evayye Atov in such a sense, nor is it used
by any New Testament, writer to designate the gospel record, or
any one of the written Gospels. . It is used always in the general

Paul himself was not an eye-witness, and Luke expressly states in

in Luke's standpoint, and in his general spirit-his Gospel is the
Gospel of universal salvation.

Eusebius was evidently thinking of Paul's references to
Epaphroditus (Phil. ii. 25) and to Archippus (Philem. 2), whom
he calls his sellow-soldiers. The Clement to whom Eusebius here
refers was a very important personage in the early Roman church,
being known to tradition as one of its first three bishops. He has
played a prominent part in Church history on account of the numer
ous writings which have passed under his name. We know nothing
certain about his life.
Eusebius identifies him with the Philippian
Clement mentioned by Paul, - an identification apparently made
first by Origen, and after him repeated by a great many writers.
But the identification is, to say the least, very doubtful, and resting
as it does upon an agreement in a very common name deserves little
consideration.
It was quite customary in the early Church to find
Paul's companions, whenever possible, in responsible and influential
sitions during the latter part of the first century. A more plausi
le theory, which, if true, would throw an interesting light upon
Clement and the Roman church of his day, is that which identifies
him with the consul Flavius Clement, a relative of the emperor Do
mitian (see below, chap. 18, note 6). Some good reasons for the
identification might be urged, and his rank would then explain well
Clement's influential position in the Church.
But as pointed out in
chap. 18, note 6, it is extremely improbable that the consul Flavius
Clement was a Christian; and in any case a fatal objection to the
identification (which is nevertheless adopted by Hilgenfeld and
others) is the fact that Clement is nowhere spoken of as a martyr
until the time of Rufinus, and also that no ancient writer identifies
him or connects him in any way with the consul, although Eusebius'
mention of the latter in ". 23 shows that he was a well-known
person. When we remember the tendency of the early Church to
make all its heroes martyrs, and to ascribe high birth to them, the
omission in this case renders the identification, we may say, virtually
impossible.
More probable is the conjecture of Lightfoot, that he
was a freedman belonging to the family of the consul Clement, whose

i\i. Dionysius has played an important part
in Church history, as the pretended author of a series of very re
markable writings, which pass under the name of Dionysius, the
Areopagite, but which in reality date srom the fifth or sixth century,
and probably owe their origin to the influence of Neo-Platonism.
The #. mention of these writings is in the records of the Council
of Constantinople (532 A.D.); but from that time on they were con
stantly used and unanimously ascribed to Dionysius, the Areopa
gite, until, in the seventeenth century, their claims to so great an
tiquity were disputed. They are still defended, however, in the face

The Last Siege of the Jews after Christ.

AFTER Nero had held the power thirteen
years,' and Galba and Otho had ruled a
year and six months," Vespasian, who had be
come distinguished in the campaigns against the
Jews, was proclaimed sovereign in Judea and
received the title of Emperor from the armies

them," and after him James, the son of Zebedee
and the brother of John, was beheaded," and
finally James, the first that had obtained the
episcopal seat in Jerusalem after the ascension
of our Saviour, died in the manner already de
scribed.'
But the rest of the apostles, who had
been incessantly plotted against with a view to
their destruction, and had been driven out of
the land of Judea, went unto all nations to
preach the Gospel, relying upon the power of
Christ, who had said to them, "Go ye and make

disciples of all the nations in my name." "

But the people of the church in Jerusa
lem had been commanded by a revelation,
vouchsafed to approved men there before the

influence among the few Christians whom Paul left in Athens is
highly probable, and the tradition that later he was made the first
bishop there is quite natural. The church of Athens plays no part
in the history o the apostolic age, and it is improbable that there
was any organization there until many years after Paul's visit; for
even in the time of Dionysius of Corinth, the church there seems to
have been extremely small and weak (cf. Bk. IV. chap. 23, § 2).

article of Lupton in the /), cf. of Christ. Zoos. I. p. 841-848.

war, to leave the city and to dwell in a certain
town of Perea called Pella." And when those
that believed in Christ had come thither from
Jerusalem, then, as if the royal city of the Jews
and the whole land of Judea were entirely desti
tute of holy men, the judgment of God at length
overtook those who had committed such out
rages against Christ and his apostles, and totally
destroyed that generation of impious men.
But the number of calamities which every
where fell upon the nation at that time, the
extreme misfortunes to which the inhabitants of
Judea were especially subjected, the thousands
of men, as well as women and children, that
perished by the sword, by famine, and by other
forms of death innumerable, - all these things, as
well as the many great sieges which were carried
on against the cities of Judea, and the excessive
sufferings endured by those that fled to Jerusa
lem itself, as to a city of perfect safety, and
finally the general course of the whole war, as
well as its particular occurrences in detail, and
how at last the abomination of desolation, pro
claimed by the prophets," stood in the very
temple of God, so celebrated of old, the temple
which was now awaiting its total and final de
struction by fire, - all these things any one that
wishes may find accurately described in the his
tory written by Josephus."

But it is necessary to state that this writer
records that the multitude of those who
were assembled from all Judea at the time of the
Passover, to the number of three million souls,"
were shut up in Jerusalem "as in a prison,"
to use his own words.
For it was right
that in the very days in which they had in
flicted suffering upon the Saviour and the Bene
factor of all, the Christ of God, that in those
days, shut up "as in a prison," they should
meet with destruction at the hands of divine
justice.

But passing by the particular calamities
which they suffered from the attempts made
upon them by the sword and by other means, I
think it necessary to relate only the misfortunes
which the famine caused, that those who read

Eusebius simply gives round numbers.
Josephus in § 3 puts the number at 2,700,oco, exclusive of the "un
clean and the strangers" who were not allowed to eat the Passover.
In the same work, Bk. II. chap. 14, § 3, Josephus states that when
Cestius. Gallus, governor of Syria, came to Jerusalem at the time
of the Passover in 65 A.D., no less than 3,000,oco persons came about
him to enter complaint against the procurator Florus. These num
bers are grossly exaggerated.
Tacitus estimates the number in the
city at the time of the siege as 6oo,ooo, but this, too, is far above
the truth. The writer of the article Gerusalem, in Smith's Bible
Pict., estimates that the city can never have had a population of
more than so, obo souls, and he concludes that at the time of the
siege there cannot have been more than 60,000 or 70,000 collected
within the walls.
This is probably too low an estimate, but shows
how far out of the way the figures of Josephus and Tacitus must be.

der pretense that they were going to desert men
were put to death for their wealth. The mad
mess of the seditions increased with the famine,
and both the miseries were inflamed more
and more day by day.
Nowhere was food
to be seen ; but, bursting into the houses,
men searched them thoroughly, and whenever
they found anything to eat they tormented the
owners on the ground that they had denied that
they had anything; but if they found nothing,
they tortured them on the ground that they
had more carefully concealed it. The proof
of their having or not having food was found
in the bodies of the poor wretches.
Those of
them who were still in good condition they as
sumed were well supplied with food, while those
who were already wasted away they passed by,
for it seemed absurd to slay those who were
on the point of perishing for want.
Many,
indeed, secretly sold their possessions for
one measure of wheat, if they belonged to the
wealthier class, of barley if they were poorer.
Then shutting themselves up in the innermost
parts of their houses, some ate the grain un
cooked on account of their terrible want, while
others baked it according as necessity and
fear dictated. Nowhere were tables set, but,
snatching the yet uncooked food from the
fire, they tore it in pieces. Wretched was the
fare, and a lamentable spectacle it was to see the
more powerful secure an abundance while
the weaker mourned.
Of all evils, indeed,
famine is the worst, and it destroys nothing
so effectively as shame.
For that which under
other circumstances is worthy of respect, in the
midst of famine is despised.
Thus women
snatched the food from the very mouths of
their husbands and children, from their fathers,
and what was most pitiable of all, mothers from
their babes. And while their dearest ones were
their arms, they were not
wasting away in
ashamed to take away from them the last
drops that supported life. And even while
they were eating thus they did not remain

they regarded it as a sign that those inside were

And immediately bursting open
the doors they rushed in and seized what they
were eating, almost forcing it out of their
very throats.
Old men who clung to their
food were beaten, and if the women con
cealed it in their hands, their hair was torn for so
doing. There was pity neither for gray hairs nor
for infants, but, taking up the babes that clung

entrance and swallowed what they were about to
seize, they were still more cruel, just as if
they had been wronged by them.
And
they devised the most terrible modes of
torture to discover food, stopping up the privy
passages of the poor wretches with bitter herbs,
and piercing their seats with sharp rods. And
men suffered things horrible even to hear of, for
the sake of compelling them to confess to the
possession of one loaf of bread, or in order
that they might be made to disclose a single
drachm of barley which they had concealed.
But the tormentors themselves did not suf
fer hunger.
Their conduct might indeed
have seemed less barbarous if they had been
driven to it by necessity; but they did it for the
sake of exercising their madness and of provid
ing sustenance for themselves for days to
come. And when any one crept out of the
city by night as far as the outposts of the
Romans to collect wild herbs and grass, they
went to meet him ; and when he thought he had
already escaped the enemy, they seized what he
had brought with him, and even though often
times the man would entreat them, and, calling
upon the most awful name of God, adjure them
to give him a portion of what he had obtained
at the risk of his life, they would give him noth
ing back.
Indeed, it was fortunate if the one
that was plundered was not also slain."

To this account Josephus, after relating
other things, adds the following : * "The
possibility of going out of the city being
brought to an end," all hope of safety for the
Jews was cut off. And the famine increased and
devoured the people by houses and families.
And the rooms were filled with dead women
and children, the lanes of the city with the
corpses of old men.
Children and youths,
swollen with the famine, wandered about
the market-places like shadows, and fell down
wherever the death agony overtook them.

sick were not strong enough to bury even their
own relatives, and those who had the strength

hesitated because of the multitude of the dead
and the uncertainty as to their own fate. Many,
indeed, died while they were burying others,
and many betook themselves to their graves
before death came upon them. There was
neither weeping nor lamentation under these
misfortunes; but the famine stifled the natural

and death-laden night encircled the city.
But the robbers were more terrible than
these miseries; for they broke open the
houses, which were now mere sepulchres, robbed
the dead and stripped the covering from their
bodies, and went away with a laugh. They tried
the points of their swords in the dead bodies,
and some that were lying on the ground still
alive they thrust through in order to test their
weapons. But those that prayed that they would
use their right hand and their sword upon them,
they contemptuously left to be destroyed by the
famine. Every one of these died with eyes fixed
upon the temple ; and they left the seditious
alive.
These at first gave orders that the
dead should be buried out of the public
treasury, for they could not endure the stench.
But afterward, when they were not able to do
this, they threw the bodies from the walls
into
And as Titus went
around and saw the trenches filled with the
dead, and the thick blood oozing out of the
putrid bodies, he groaned aloud, and, raising his
hands, called God to witness that this was
not his doing."
After speaking of some
other things, Josephus proceeds as fol
lows: " "I cannot hesitate to declare what my
feelings compel me to.
I suppose, if the Ro
mans had longer delayed in coming against
these guilty wretches, the city would have been
swallowed up by a chasm, or overwhelmed with
a flood, or struck with such thunderbolts as de
stroyed Sodom.
For it had brought forth a
generation of men much more godless than
were those that suffered such punishment.
By
their madness indeed was the whole people

And in the sixth book he writes as fol
lows:" "Of those that perished by famine
in the city the number was countless, and the
miseries they underwent unspeakable.
For if
so much as the shadow of food appeared in any
house, there was war, and the dearest friends en
gaged in hand-to-hand conflict with one another,
and snatched from each other the most wretched
supports of life. Nor would they believe
that even the dying were without food; but
the robbers would search them while they

were expiring, lest any one should feign death
while concealing food in his bosom.
With
mouths gaping for want of food, they stumbled
and staggered along like mad dogs, and beat
the doors as if they were drunk, and in their
impotence they would rush
the same
houses twice or thrice in one hour. Ne
cessity compelled them to eat anything
they could find, and they gathered and de
voured things that were not fit even for the filth
iest of irrational beasts.
Finally they did not
abstain even from their girdles and shoes, and
they stripped the hides off their shields and de
voured them.
Some used even wisps of old
hay for food, and others gathered stubble and
sold the smallest weight of it for four Attic
drachmae."

gladly have omitted this calamity, that I might

in my own age.
And besides, I should render
my country poor service if I suppressed the ac
count of the sufferings which she endured.
"There was a certain woman named
Mary that dwelt beyond Jordan, whose
father was Eleazer, of the village of Bathezor'
(which signifies the house of hyssop).
She was
distinguished for her family and her wealth, and
had fled with the rest of the multitude to Jerusa
lem and was shut up there with them during
the siege. The tyrants had robbed her of the
rest of the property which she had brought
with her into the city from Perea. And the rem
nants of her possessions and whatever food was
to be seen the guards rushed in daily and
snatched away from her. This made the woman
terribly angry, and by her frequent reproaches
and imprecations she aroused the anger of
the rapacious villains against herself.
But
no one either through anger or pity would
slay her; and she grew weary of finding food
for others to eat. The search, too, was already
become everywhere difficult, and the famine was
piercing her bowels and marrow, and resentment
was raging more violently than famine.
Taking,
therefore, anger and necessity as her counsellors,
she proceeded to do a most unnatural thing.
Seizing her child, a boy which was sucking
at her breast, she said, Oh, wretched child,

Very soon the rioters appeared on the

threatened to slay her immediately unless she
should show them what she had prepared.
She
replied that she had saved an excellent portion
for them, and with that she uncovered the
remains of the child. They were immedi

had done it themselves.
Those that were
suffering from the famine now longed for
death; and blessed were they that had died be

Such was the reward which the Jews re
ceived for their wickedness and impiety

against the Christ of God.

CHAPTER VII.

The Predictions of Christ.

there shall be great tribulation, such as was not
since the beginning of the world to this time,
no, nor ever shall be."

The historian, reckoning the whole number of the slain, says that eleven hundred
thousand persons perished by famine and sword,"
and that the rest of the rioters and robbers, being
betrayed by each other after the taking of the city,
were slain." But the tallest of the youths and those
that were distinguished for beauty were preserved
for the triumph. Of the rest of the multitude,
those that were over seventeen years of age were
sent as prisoners to labor in the works of Egypt,"
while still more were scattered through the prov
inces to meet their death in the theaters by the
sword and by beasts. Those under seventeen
years of age were carried away to be sold as
the number
slaves, and of these alone
reached ninety thousand."
These things
took place in this manner in the second
year of the reign of Vespasian," in accordance
with the prophecies of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, who by divine power saw them be
forehand as if they were already present, and
wept and mourned according to the statement
of the holy evangelists, who give the very words
which he uttered, when, as if addressing
Jerusalem herself, he said:" "If thou hadst
known, even thou, in this day, the things
which belong unto thy peace |
But now they
are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come
upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a rampart
about thee, and compass thee round, and keep
thee in on every side, and shall lay thee and
thy children even with the ground." And
then, as if speaking concerning the people,
he says," "For there shall be great distress in
the land, and wrath upon this people. And they
shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be
led away captive into all nations. And Jerusa
lem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until
the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled."
And
again: " "When ye shall see Jerusalem com

Valesius, without MS. authority (but apparently with the

by Walesius produces very g

The quarries were

quarrying was done largely by captives taken in war, as in the
present case.

was upward of 90,000, as Eusebius asserts, but simply (ford. $ 3) that
the number of captives taken during the whole war was 97,909, a
number which Eusebius, through an error, applies to the one class
of prisoners that were sold as slaves.

passed with armies, then know that the desola

tion thereof is nigh."

If any one compares the words of our
Saviour with the other accounts of the his
torian concerning the whole war, how can one
fail to wonder, and to admit that the foreknowl
edge and the prophecy of our Saviour were
truly divine and marvellously strange." Con
cerning those calamities, then, that befell the
whole Jewish nation after the Saviour's passion
and after the words which the multitude of the
Jews uttered, when they begged the release of
the robber and murderer, but besought that the
Prince of Life should be taken from their midst,"
it is not necessary to add anything to the
account of the historian.
But it may be
proper to mention also those events which
exhibited the graciousness of that all-good Provi
dence which held back their destruction full forty
years after their crime against Christ, - during
which time many of the apostles and disciples,
and James himself the first bishop there, the
one who is called the brother of the Lord," were
still alive, and dwelling in Jerusalem itself, re
mained the surest bulwark of the place.
Divine
Providence thus still proved itself long-suffering
toward them in order to see whether by repent
ance for what they had done they might obtain
pardon and salvation; and in addition to such
long-suffering, Providence also furnished won
derful signs of the things which were about
to happen to them if they did not repent.
Since these matters have been thought
worthy of mention by the historian already
cited, we cannot do better than to recount them
for the benefit of the readers of this work.

CHAPTER VIII.

The Signs which preceded the War.

l

TAKING, then, the work of this author,
read what he records in the sixth book of
his History.
His words are as follows:" "Thus
were the miserable people won over at this time
by the impostors and false prophets; * but they

* It is but right to remark that not merely the negative school
of critics, but even many conservative scholars (e.g. Weiss) put the
composition of the Gospel of Luke after the year 70, because its es
chatological discourses seem to bear the mark of having been re
corded after the fulfillment of the prediction, differing as they do
in many minor particulars from the accounts of the same discourses
in Matthew and Mark. To cite a single instance: in the passage
quoted just above from Luke xxi. 29, the armies encompassing Jeru
salem are mentioned, while in parallel passages in the other Gospels
(Matt. xxiv. 15 and Mark xiii. 14) not armies, but "the abomina.
tion of desolation standing in the holy place" is spoken of as the
sign. Compare the various commentaries upon these passages.
* Compare Acts iii. 14, and see Matt. xvii. 20, K. xv. II,
* See above, Bk. I. chap. 12, note 14.

Luke xxii. 18.

" Josephus, B. 9. Bk. VI, chap. 5, § 3.
* kata levóóuevo too be ov.

In the previous paragraph Josephus
says that a great many false prophets were suborned by the tyrants
to o on the people.
It is to these false prophets therefore that
he refers here, and I have consequently felt at liberty thus to trans
late the Greek word given above, instead of rendering merely "liars

did not heed nor give credit to the visions and
signs that foretold the approaching desolation.
On the contrary, as if struck by lightning, and as
if possessing neither eyes nor understanding,
they slighted the proclamations of God. At
one time a star, in form like a sword, stood
over the city, and a comet, which lasted for a whole
year; and again before the revolt and before the
disturbances that led to the war, when the people
were gathered for the feast of unleavened bread,
on the eighth of the month Xanthicus," at the
ninth hour of the night, so great a light shone
about the altar and the temple that it seemed to
be bright day; and this continued for half an
hour. This seemed to the unskillful a good sign,
but was interpreted by the sacred scribes as por
tending those events which very soon took
place. And at the same feast a cow, led
by the high priest to be sacrificed, brought
forth a lamb in the midst of the temple.
And the eastern gate of the inner temple,
which was of bronze and very massive, and
which at evening was closed with difficulty by
twenty men, and rested upon iron-bound beams,
and had bars sunk deep in the ground, was seen
at the sixth hour of the night to open of
itself. And not many days after the feast,
on the twenty-first of the month Artemi
sium," a certain marvelous vision was seen which
passes belief. The prodigy might seem fabu
lous were it not related by those who saw it, and
were not the calamities which followed deserv

ing of such signs.
the sun chariots and armed troops were seen
throughout the whole region in mid-air, wheeling
through the clouds and encircling the cities.
And at the feast which is called Pentecost,
when the priests entered the temple at
night, as was their custom, to perform the ser
vices, they said that at first they perceived a
movement and a noise, and afterward a voice as
of a great multitude, saying, ‘Let us go
hence."
But what follows is still more
terrible; for a certain Jesus, the son of
Ananias, a common countryman, four years be
fore the war," when the city was particularly

against God" (as Cruse does), which is indefinite, and might have
various meanings.

* 'Aprop troos.

* The feast referred to is the feast of the Passover. The Greek
name of the month used here is favouxos, which was the name of a
Macedonian month corresponding to our April. According to Whis
ton, Josephus regularly used this name for the Jewish month Nisan
(the first month of the Jewish year), in which case this event took
place six days before the Passover, which began on the 14th of Nisan.
According to Liddell and Scott, this was a Spar
tan and Macedonian month corresponding to a part of the ninth
Attic month (* Aadmbox two), of". turn corresponded to the
latter part of our March and the early part of April. . According to
Wieseler, Josephus used the word to §. the second month of the
Jewish year, the month lyar.
* The majority of the Šišs. of Eusebius read utraßaivouev, "we
go hence."
But at least one of the best MSS. and a majority of the
MSS. of Josephus, supported by Rufinus and Jerome (who render
on Forem os), read u era Bai you to, "let us go hence," and I have fol
lowed Stephanus, Walesius, Stroth, and the English and German
translators in adopting that reading.

tain of the more distinguished

prosperous and peaceful, came to the feast, at
which it was customary for all to make tents at
the temple to the honor of God, and suddenly
began to cry out : "A voice from the east, a
voice from the west, a voice from the four winds,
a voice against Jerusalem and the temple, a voice
against bridegrooms and brides, a voice against

vexed at the ominous cry, seized the man and
beat him with many stripes.
But without utter
ing a word in his own behalf, or saying anything
in particular to those that were present, he con
tinued to cry out in the same words as be
fore.
And the rulers, thinking, as was true,
that the man was moved by a higher power,
brought him before the Roman governor." And
then, though he was scourged to the bone, he
neither made supplication nor shed tears, but,
changing his voice to the most lamentable tone
possible, he answered each stroke with the
words, ‘Woe, woe unto Jerusalem.'"

The same historian records another fact
still more wonderful than this. He says"
that a certain oracle was found in their sacred
writings which declared that at that time a cer
tain person should go forth from their country
to rule the world. He himself understood
that this was fulfilled in Vespasian.
But
Vespasian did not rule the whole world, but
only that part of it which was subject to the
Romans. With better right could it be applied
to Christ; to whom it was said by the Father,
"Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen
for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth
for thy possession."" At that very time, indeed,
the voice of his holy apostles "went throughout
all the earth, and their words to the end of the
world.""

CHAPTER IX.

Josephus and the Works which he has /s/.

l

AFTER all this it is fitting that we should
know something in regard to the origin and
family of Josephus, who has contributed so much
to the history in hand. He himself gives us in
formation on this point in the following words:"

in 66 A.D. A little further on, Josephus says that he continued his
cry for seven years and five months, when he was slain during the
siege of Jerusalem.
This shows that he is here, as well as else
where, reckoning the date of the beginning of the war as 66 A.D.

Josephus, not only in his various works, in which he makes frequent

"Josephus, the son of Mattathias, a priest of
Jerusalem, who himself fought against the Ro
mans in the beginning and was compelled to
be present at what happened afterward." He
was the most noted of all the Jews of that day,
not only among his own people, but also among
the Romans, so that he was honored by the erec
tion of a statue in Rome," and his works were
deemed worthy of a place in the library."
He wrote the whole of the Antiquities of
the Jews" in twenty books, and a history of
the war with the Romans which took place in
his time, in seven books." He himself testifies
that the latter work was not only written in
Greek, but that it was also translated by himself

reference to himself, but also in his autobiography, which was writ
ten after the year 100. The work was occasioned by the Chronicle
of Justus of Tiberias, which had represented him as more patriotic
and more hostile to the Romans than he liked, and he therefore felt
impelled to paint himself in the blackest of colors, as a traitor and
renegade, - probably much blacker than he really was.
It is de
voted chiefly to an account of the intrigues and plots formed against
him while he was governor of Galilee, and contains little of general
biographical interest, except in the introduction and the conclusion.
Josephus was of a priestly family, - his father Matthias belonging
to the first of the twenty-four courses, - and he was born in the first
fear of Caius Caesar; i.e. in the year beginning March 16, 37 A.D.
e played a prominent part in the Jewish war, being očíči
the duty, as governor ol. and commander of the forces there,
of meeting and opposing Vespasian, who attacked that province
first. He was, however, defeated, and gave himself up to the vic
tors, in the summer of 67. He was treated with honor in the camp
of the Romans, whom he served until the end of the war, and be
came a favorite and flatterer of the Vespasian house, incurring
thereby the everlasting contempt of his countrymen. He went to
Rome at the close of the war, and lived in prosperity there until
early in the second century.
His works are our chief source for a
knowledge of Jewish affairs from the time of the Maccabees, and as
such are, and will always remain, indispensable, and their author
immortal, whatever his character. He was a man of learning and of
talent, but of inordinate selfishness and self-esteem. He was for
merly accused of great inaccuracy, and his works were considered a
very poor historical source; but later investigations have increased
his credit, and he seems, upon the whole, to have been a historian
of unusual ability and conscientiousness.

* Eusebius is the only one, so far as we know, to mention this
statue in Rome, and what authority there is for his statement we
cannot tell.

* In § 64 of his Life Josephus tells us that Titus was so much
pleased with his accounts of the Jewish war that he subscribed his
name to them, and ordered them published (see the next chapter,
i. sqq., where the passage is quoted). The first public library in
ome, according to Pliny, was sounded by Pollio (76 B.C.-4 A.D.).
The one referred to here is undoubtedly the imperial library, which,
according to Suetonius, was originally established by Augustus in
the temple of Apollo on the Palatine, and contained two sections, -
one for Greek, and the other for Latin works.
It was greatly en
larged by Tiberius and Domitian.

* 'Iovčaixi, 'Apxaloaoyia, Antiouitates 9 udaicar. This work,
which is still extant, is Josephus' most extensive work, and aims to
give, in twenty books, a complete history of the Jews, from the time
of Abraham to the beginning of the great war with Rome. The ob
ject of the work is mainly apologetic, the author aiming to place
{o before Gentile readers in as favorable a light as possible.
t contains much legendary matter, but is the main source for our
knowledge of a long period of Jewish history, and as such is invalu
able. The work was completed, according to his own statement
§. 11. 2), in the thirteenth year of Domitian (93-94 A.D.), and
requently corrects erroneous statements made in his earlier work
upon the Jewish war.

* 'Io ropia 'Iov6aixod moxeuov mpos "Pou atous, de Bello 9 u
daico.
This work, in seven books, constitutes our most complete
and trustworthy source for a knowledge of that great war, so mo
mentous in its consequences both to Judaism and to Christianity.
The author wrote from personal knowledge of many of the events
described, and had, besides, access to extensive and reliable written
sources; and the general accuracy of the work may therefore be
accepted. He says that he undertook the work for the purpose of
giving a true narrative of the war, in consequence of the many false
and distorted accounts which had already appeared in various quar;
ters. He presented the work, when finished, to Vespasian and
Titus, and obtained their approval and testimony to its trustwor:
thiness; and hence it must have been written during the reign of
Vespasian, probably toward the end of it, as other works upon the
war had preceded his (B. J., Preface, $ 1).

CHAPTER X.

The Manner in which Josephus mentions the
Divine Books.

* The work, as Josephus informs us (B. 9., Preface, § 1; and
contra AA fort. I. 9), was written originally in his own tongue, -
Aramaic, - and afterwards translated by himself into Greek, with
the help of others.
Eusebius inverts the fact, making the Greek the
original.

* The full title of this work is the A/ology of Flazius Şosephus
on the Antiquities of the 7e ros against Affon (mept åpxa torntos
'Iovčatwoo Kata. Amoros, /9c. 1 nt outtate 9 nataeorum contra .4/to

Apion). It consists ...'. books, and is, in fact, nothing else than an
apology for Judaism in general, and to a less extent, a defense of
himself and his former work (the Antiquities) against hostile critics.
The common title, contra AA forem, is rather misleading, as he is
not once mentioned in the first book, although in the first part of the
second book he is attacked with considerable bitterness and through
him a large class of enemies and detractors of Judaism. (Upon Apion,
the famous Alexandrian and the bitter enemy of the Jews, see above,
Bk. II. chap. 5, note 5.) The work is Josephus' best effort from a
literary point of view, and shows both learning and ability, and in
spite of its brevity contains much of great value.
It was written
after his Antiguities (i.e. after 93 A.D.), how long afterward we
cannot tell. These three works of joiás, with his autobiography
already mentioned (note 1), are all that are extant, although he
seems to have written another work relating to the history of the
Seleucidae (cf. A st. XIII. 2. 1, 2.4, 4.6, 5. 11) of which not a trace
remains, and which is mentioned by no one else. The other works
planned by Josephus - On God and his /'ssence (.4 mt. XX.
11. 3), and On the Laws of the 7ews (főif. and Ant. III. 5.6,
(They are mentioned
8. 10) - seem never to have been written.
also by Eusebius in the next chapter.)
Other compositions at
tributed to him are not from his hand. The best edition of the
works of Josephus is that of Benedict Niese (Berlin, 1885 sq.), of
which the first two volumes have been already issued, comprising
ten books of the Antiquities. A good complete edition is that of
Dindorf (Paris, 1845-47, 2 vols.).
That of Bekker (Leipzig, 1855,
6 vols.), is very convenient. . The only complete English translation
is by Whiston, unfortunately uncritical and inaccurate.
Traill's
translation of the Jewish Is 'ar (London, 1862) is a great improve
ment, but does not cover the remainder of Josephus' works. Upon
Josephus and his writings, see the article of Edersheim in the Dict.
of Christ. Biog. III. 441-460, and compare the literature given
there.
* A gainst Apion, I. 8. The common Christian tradition (since
the first ..". when it was stated in the fourth book of Ezra xiv.
# sq.) is that Ezra was the compiler of the Old Testament canon.
This, however, is a mistake, for the canon was certainly not com
pleted before the time of Judas Maccabaeus.
Josephus is the earli
est writer to give us a summary of the books of the Old Testament:
and he evidently gives not merely his own private opinion, but the
commonly accepted canon of his day. He does not name the sepa
rate books, but |. tells us that they were twenty-two in number (the
number of the letters of the #. alphabet), and gives us the
three divisions, so that we are able to ascertain his canon in detail.

His

pect it to be the same as that of Josephus, which makes it more
probable that the omission of Esther was only accidental. Origen
(in Eusebius, VI. 25) tells us that there were twenty-two books in
the Hebrew canon; but his list differs somewhat from that of Jose

The peculiar thing about the list is the omission of the Twelve
Minor Prophets and the insertion of the Epistle of Jeremiah. The
former were certainly looked upon by Origen as sacred books, for he
wrote a commentary upon them (according to Eusebius, WI. 36).
There is no conceivable reason for their omission, and indeed de,
are needed to make up the number twenty-two. We must conclude
that the omission was simply an oversight on the part of Eusebius
or of some transcriber. o, gives them as number sixteen, as
shown in the list, but the position there assigned to them is not the
ordinary one. We should expect to find them in connection with
the other prophets; but the various lists are by no means uniform
in the order of the books. On the other hand, the Greek Epistle of
so (Baruch vi.) did not stand in the Hebrew canon, and can
ave been included by Origen here only because he had been used
to seeing it in connection with Jeremiah in his copy of the LXX.
(for in ancient MSS. of the LXX., which probably represent the
original arrangement, it is given not as a part of Baruch, but as an
appendix to Lamentations), and hence mentioned it in this book
without thinking of its absence from the Hebrew canon.
Origen
adds the Maccabees to his list, but expressly excludes them from
the twenty-two books (see Bk. VI. chap. 25, note 5). Meanwhile
the Talmud and the Midrash divide the canon into twenty-four books,
and this was probably the original Jewish division. The number
twenty-two was gained by adding Ruth to Judges and Lamentations
to Jeremiah. The number thus obtained agreed with the number of
letters in the alphabet, and was therefore accepted as the number
sanctioned by divine authority, and the division was commonly
adopted by the early Fathers.
This is Strack's view, and seems
better than the opposite opinion, which is advocated by many, that
the number twenty-two was the original.
It is easier to see how
twenty-four might be changed to twenty-two than how the reverse
should happen.
So, for instance, Jerome, in his preface to the trans
lation of Samuel and Kings, makes the number twenty-two, and
gives a list which agrees with the canon of Josephus except in the
three general divisions, which are differently composed.
It will be
seen that these various lists (with the exception of that of Origen,
which includes the Epistle of Jeremiah and appends the Maccabees)
include only the books of our canon. But the LXX. prints with the
Old Testament a number of Books which we call Apocrypha and ex
clude from the canon.
It has been commonly supposed, therefore,
that there was a regular Alexandrian canon differing from the Pales
tinian. But this is not likely. An examination of Philo's use of the
Old Testament shows us that his canon agreed with that of Josephus,

death of Artaxerxes, who succeeded Xerxes
as king of Persia, the prophets that followed

hymns to God, and precepts for the regula

From the time of
Artaxerxes to our own day all the events

fourth century the Eastern Fathers used them less and less. They

chism of the Orthodox Catholic Eastern Church, the most authorita
tive standard of the Graeco-Russian Church, expressly excluded them.
The Latin Church, meanwhile, has always regarded §: Apocrypha as
canonical, and by its action at the Council of Trent has made them
a part of the official canon.

6. Ezra and Nehemiah.
7. Esther.
As will be seen, Josephus divided the canon into three parts: first,
the Law (five books of Moses): second, the Prophets (the thirteen
just mentioned); third, the Hagiographa (Psalms, Proverbs, Eccle
siastes, and Canticles). The division of the canon into three such
parts is older than Josephus; at the same time, his division is quite
Jerome's is as follows: -
different from any other division known.

1. Law: five books of Moses.
2. Prophets: Joshua, Judges and Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah,
lso and Lamentations, Ezekiel, Twelve Minor Prophets (eight
ooks).
3. Hagiographa (Holy writings): Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Eccle
siastes, Canticles, Daniel, Chronicles, Ezra, Esther (nine books).
The division which exists in our Hebrew Bibles differs from this of
Jerome's only in transferring Ruth and Lamentations to the third
division, and thus making twenty-four books. This is held by many
to be a later form, as remarked above, but as Strack shows, it is
rather the original.
In the LXX., which is followed in our Eng
lish Bible, the books are arranged, without reference to the three
divisions, solely according to their subject-matter. The peculiar
division of Josephus was caused by his looking at the matter from
the historical standpoint, which led him to include in the second
division all the books which contained, as he says, an account of
events from Moses to Artaxerxes.

For although
so great a period has already passed by, no one
has ventured either to add to or to take from
them, but it is inbred in all Jews from their very
birth to regard them as the teachings of God,
and to abide by them, and, if necessary, cheer
fully to die for them."

These remarks of the historian I have thought

might advantageously be introduced in this
connection. Another work of no little merit
has been produced by the same writer, On
the Supremacy of Reason," which some have
called Maccabaicum,' because it contains ah
account of the struggles of those Hebrews who
contended manfully for the true religion, as is
related in the books called
Maccabees.
And at the end of the twentieth book of
his Antiquities* Josephus himself intimates
that he had purposed to write a work in four
books concerning God and his existence, accord
ing to the traditional opinions of the Jews, and
also concerning the laws, why it is that they per
mit some things while prohibiting others." And
the same writer also mentions in his own
works other books written by himself."

addition to these things it is proper to quote
also the words that are found at the close of his

which we have drawn from his accounts.

It was commonly held
among the Jews that with Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi the pro
phetical spirit had departed from Israel, and the line was sharply
drawn, as here by ło, between them and the writers of the
Apocrypha who followed them.

The first of them reads as follows (according to Whiston's transla

that thou hast done it much more accurately and with greater care

See above, Bk. II. chap. 23.

* See ord, note 4o. The date of Symeon's accession (assuming
that he did take charge of the Jerusalem church as James had
done) cannot be fixed.
Eusebius himself, as he informs us in Bk.
IV. chap. 5, although he had a list of the Jerusalem bishops, had no
information as to the dates of their accession, or the length of their
incumbency. He puts Symeon's accession after the destruction of
Jerusalem, but he evidently does that only because he supposed that
it followed immediately upon the death of James. Some (e.g. Light
foot) think it probable that Symeon was appointed immediately after
James' death, therefore before the destruction of Jerusalem; others
(e.g. Renan) suppose that in Pella they had no bishop and ap
pointed Symeon only after the return of ise church to Jerusalem.
* Aoyos ...g. Hegesippus (quoted in Bk. IV. chap. 22, be
low) says that "Symeon was appointed the second bishop, whom all
proposed as the cousin of our Lord." Upon what authority Euse

bius' more definite account rests we do not know. He introduces it
with the formula Aéyos karéxes, and we know of no other author
who has put it as he does.
It may be that the simple statement of
Hegesippus was the sole ground of the more detailed tradition which
Eusebius repeats in this chapter. The reason of Symeon's appoint
ment as given by Hegesippus is quite significant.
It was the com
mon Oriental custom to accord the highest honors to all the members
of a prophet's or religious leader's family, and it was undoubtedly
owing chiefly to his close physical relationship to Christ that James
enjoyed ". prominence and influence in the Jerusalem church,
apparently exceeding even that of the apostles themselves.
* This Symeon is to be distinguished from the apostle Simon, the
Canaanite, and also from Simon, the brother of our Lord (mentioned
in Matt. xiii. 55 and Mark vi. 3).
It is noticeable that Hegesippus
nowhere calls him the "brother of the Lord," though he does give

claim, James the Little is to be identified with James the son of Al
phaeus, the apostle, and hence the latter was the brother of Symeon.
This identification, however, is entirely arbitrary, and linguistically
difficult, and we shall do better therefore to keep the men separate,
as Renan does (see above, Bk. I. chap. 12, note 14). Upon the
martyrdom of Symeon, see below, chap. 32.

* In John xix. 25.
* Hegesippus, quoted below in Bk. IV. chap. 22, calls Clopas the
uncle of the Lord, which would make him of course the brother or
brother-in-law of Joseph.
Eusebius evidently considered them own
brothers. Whether Hegesippus elsewhere stated this directly, or
whether Eusebius' opinion is simply an inference from the words of
Hegesippus already referred to, we do not know. There is no ob
jection to the conclusion that Clopas and Joseph were own brothers,
although it cannot be proved from Hegesippus' words that they were
more than brothers-in-law. From John xix. 25 it is at any rate plain
that their wives cannot have been own sisters, as was formerly main
tained by so many commentators. With the remaining possibilities
of relationship we do not need to concern ourselves.

It is not certain that Eusebius intends to give Hegesippus as
his authority for the statements of this chapter, inasmuch as he does
not mention his name. He gives the account, however, upon the
authority of some one else, and not as a direct historical statement,
for the verb is in the infinitive, and it is much more natural to
supply 'Hymoon ros to rope, the last words of the preceding chapter,

words that are to be supplied, but it seems to me beyond doubt that
this account rests upon the same authority as that of the previous
chapter. There is in any case nothing at all unlikely in the report,
as Vespasian and his successors kept a very close watch upon the
Jews, and this would have been a very natural method of endeavor
ing to prevent future revolutions. The same course was pursued
also by Domitian; see below, chaps. 19 and 20. We hear from no
other source of a persecution raised against the Jews by Vespasian,
and we may therefore conclude that it cannot have amounted to
much, is indeed it deserves to be called a persecution at all.

Irenaeus, in the fifth book of
his work Against Heresies, where he dis
cusses the number of the name of Antichrist
which is given in the so-called Apocalypse of
John," speaks as follows concerning him :
* "If it were necessary for his name to be

* Unanimous tradition, beginning with Irenaeus (V. 30.3, quoted

John and the apocalyptic visions to the reign of Domitian. This

scholars, to the conclusion that the Apocalypse must have been
written before the destruction of Jerusalem, the banishment there

into the reign of Domitian. Compare especially Harmack's appen.
dix to Vischer's pamphlet ; and upon the Apocalypse itself, see
chap. 24, below.
Rev. xiii. 18.

It will be noticed that Eusebius is careful not to
commit himself here on the question of the authorship of the Apoca
lypse.

See below, chap. 24, note 20.

* Irenaeus, A do. Haer. V. 30. 3.; quoted also below, in Bk. V.
*jerome, in his version of the Chron. of Eusebius (year of Abr.
2112), says that the historian and chronographer Bruttius recorded
that many of the Christians suffered martyrdom under Domitian.
Since the works of Bruttius are not extant, we have no means of
verifying the statement. Dion Cassius (LXVII. 14) relates some of
the banishments which took place under Domitian, among them that
of Flavia Domitilla, who was, as we know, a Christian; but he does
not himself say that any of these people were Christians, nor does he
speak of a persecution of the Christians.

* We learn from Suetonius (Dom it. chap. 15) that the events
referred to by Eusebius in the next sentence took place at the ver
end of Dornitian's reign; that is, in the year 96 A.D., the o
year of his reign, as Eusebius says. Dion Cassius also (LXVII. 14)
puts these events in the same year.

the Evocatus."

For Domitian feared the com

two sons were designated as heirs to the empire, while Flavius
Clemens himself was made Domitian's colleague in the consulship.
But immediately afterward Clemens was put to death and Domitilla
was banished.
Suetonius (Pomit, chap. 15) accuses Clemens of
contempt?ssimae inertiae, and Dion Cassius (LXVII. 14) of atheism
(&bedrooros). These accusations are just such as heathen writers of
that age were fond of making against the Christians (compare, for
instance, Athenagoras' A do. Gent. chap. 4, and Tertullian's .4/o/.
chap. 42).
Accordingly it has been very commonly held that
both Flavius Clemens and Domitilla were Christians, and were pun
ished on that account.
But early tradition makes only Domitilla a
Christian; and certainly if Clemens also - a man of such high rank
- had been a Christian, an early tradition to that effect, wculd be
somewhere preserved. We must, therefore, conclude that his offense
was something else than Christianity. The very silenge of Christian
tradition as to Clement is an argument for the truth of the tradition
in regard to Domitilla, and the heathen historians referred to Con
firm its main points, though they differ in minor details. The Acts
of Martyrdom of Merezis a zoo. A choses represent Domitilla as the
niece, not the wife, of Flavius Clemens, and Fusebius does the
same.
More than that, while the heathen writers report that Domi
tilla was banished to the island Pandeteria, these Acts, as well as
Eusebius and Jerome ..." ado. Fustacáin mo, Migne's ed., F.A.
CVIII. 7), give the island of Pontia as the place of banishment.
Tillemont and other writers have therefore assumed that there were

suppose that there was but one Domitilla and but one island, and
that the discrepancies are due to carelessness or to the mistakes of
transcribers.
Pandeteria and Pontia were two small islands in the
Mediterranean, just west of central Italy, and were very frequently
employed by the Roman emperors as places of exile for prisoners.

It is noticeable that, although Euse
bius has the written authority of Hegesippus for this, account, he
still speaks of it as supported by "ancient tradition." This is difier
ent from his ordinary custom, and serves to make us careful in
drawing conclusions as to the nature of Eusebius' authority for any
statement from the expression used in introducing it.
* This Jude was the brother of James, "the brother of the Lord,"
who is mentioned in Jude 1, and is to be distinguished from Jude
(Thaddeus-Lebbeus), one of the Twelve, whose name appears in
the catalogues of Luke (Luke vi. 14 and Acts i. o, as the son of
James (not his brother, as the A. V. translates; the Greek words
are 'Iow8as 'Iaxa, Bov).

he asked them if they were descendants of
David, and they confessed that they were. Then
he asked them how much property they
had, or how much money they owned. And
both of them answered that they had only
nine thousand denarii," half of which be

did not consist of silver, but of a piece of

the hardness of their bodies and the cal

And when they were asked concerning
Christ and his kingdom, of what sort it
was and where and when it was to appear, they
answered that it was not a temporal nor an

one, which would appear at the end of the world,

These things are related by Hegesippus.

Tertullian also has mentioned Domitian
in the following words : * "Domitian also,
who possessed a share of Nero's cruelty, at
tempted once to do the same thing that the
latter did. But because he had, I suppose, some
intelligence," he very soon ceased, and even
recalled those whom he had banished."
But after Domitian had reigned fifteen
years," and Nerva had succeeded to the empire,
the Roman Senate, according to the writers that

but in his case the political situation was far more serious, and revo
lutions under the lead of one of the royal family might most natu
rally be expected just aster the terrible destruction. The same act
is also mentioned in connection with Trajan, in chap. 32, and there
is no reason to doubt its truthfulness, for the Jews were well known
as a most rebellious and troublesome people.

* A denarius was a Roman silver coin, in value about sixteen,

or, according to others, about nineteen, cents.

* "Taxes or tributes were paid commonly in the products of the

land" (Val.).

* Most editors (including Valesius, Heinichen, Cruse, &c.) re
gard the quotation from Hegesippus as extending through $8; but
it really ends here, and from this point on Eusebius reproduces the
sense in his own words (and so Bright gives it in his edition). This
is perfectly clear, for in the first place, the infinitive . To ovova.

that the latter is a free reproduction.

Apost. Const. VII, 46, where, however, it is said that Fyodius was
ordained by Peter, and Ignatius by Paul (as in the parallel case of
Clement of Rome). The fact that the name of Evodius appears
here shows that the tradition that he was the first bishop sermed to
the author too old and too strong to be set aside.
Origen (on 1.7, c.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

Marrative concerning 9 ohn the Apostle.

At that time the apostle and evangelist
John, the one whom Jesus loved, was still
living in Asia, and governing the churches of
that region, having returned after the death of
Domitian from his exile on the island."
And that he was still alive at that time * may
be established by the testimony of two
witnesses.
They should be trustworthy who
have maintained the orthodoxy of the Church ;
and such indeed were Irenaeus and Clem
ent of Alexandria." The former in the sec
ond book of his work Against Heresies,
writes as follows : * "And all the elders that as
sociated with John the disciple of the Lord in
Asia bear witness that John delivered it to them.
For he remained among them until the
time of Trajan."" And in the third book
of the same work he attests the same thing
in the following words:" "But the church in
Ephesus also, which was founded by Paul, and
where John remained until the time of Trajan,
is a faithful witness of the apostolic tradi
tion."
Clement likewise in his book enti
tled What Rich Man can be saved P'
indicates the time," and subjoins a narrative

* That is, at the beginning of the reign of Trajan.
* The test of a man's trustworthiness in Fusebius' mind - and
not in his alone - was his orthodoxy.
I renaeus has always been
looked upon as orthodox, and so was Clement, in the early Church,
which reckoned him among the saints.
His name, however, was
omitted in the Martyrology issued by Clement VIII., on the ground
that his orthodoxy was open to suspicion.

* Irenaeus, Adro. A/aer. II. 22. 5.
* It is in this immediate connection that Irenaeus makes the ex
traordinary assertion, founding it upon the testimony of those who
were with John in Asia, that Christ lived to the age of forty or fifty
ears. A statement occurring in connection §§ such a palpably
alse report might well fall under suspicion; but the fact of John's
continuance at Ephesus until the time of Trajan is supported by
other passages, and there is no reason to doubt it (cf. chap. 1, note
6).
Irenaeus himself repeats the statement as a well-known fact, in
III. 3, 4 (quoted just .. It may also be said that the opinion
as to Christ's age is founded upon subjective grounds (cf. the pre
ceding paragraph of Irenaeus) and upon a mistaken interpretation of
John viii. 56, 57, rather than upon external testimony, and that the
testimony (which itself may have been only the result of a subjec
tive opinion) is dragged in only for the sake of confirming a view
already adopted. . Such a fact as John's own presence in Ephesus
at a certain period could hardly be subject to such uncertainty and
to the influence of dogmatic prepossessions.
It is significant of
Eusebius' method that he omits entirely Irenaeus' statement as to
the length of Christ's ministry, with which he did not agree (as
shown by his account in Bk. I. chap. 10, while extracting from his
statement the single fact which he wishes here to ...i. The
falsity of the context he must have recognized, and yet, in his re
spect for Irenaeus, the great maintainer of sound doctrine, he no
where refers to it. The information which John is said, in this pas
sage, to have conveyed to the "presbyters of Asia" is that Christ
lived to old age. The whole passage affords an instance of how
much of error may be i...! in what, to all appearances, should
be a very trustworthy tradition.
Internal evidence must come to
the support of external, and with all its alleged uncertainty and sub
jectivity, must play a great part in the determination of §e truth of
istory.

tle, which has been handed down and treasured
up in memory.
For when, after the tyrant's
death," he returned from the isle of Patmos to
Ephesus, he went away upon their invitation to
the neighboring territories of the Gentiles, to ap
point bishops in some places, in other places to
set in order whole churches, elsewhere to choose
to the ministry some one" of those that
were pointed out by the Spirit. When he
had come to one of the cities not far away
(the name of which is given by some"), and had
consoled the brethren in other matters, he finally
turned to the bishop that had been appointed,
and seeing a youth of powerful physique, of
pleasing appearance, and of ardent tempera
ment, he said, "This one I commit to thee in
all earnestness in the presence of the Church
and with Christ as witness.'
And when the
bishop had accepted the charge and had prom
ised all, he repeated the same injunction with an
appeal to the same witnesses, and then de
parted for Ephesus.
But the presbyter,"
taking home the youth committed to him,

mention of John a little below as "an aged man" would seem to
point to the end of the century rather than to Nero's time.
At any
rate, Eusebius understood Clement as referring to Domitian, and in
the presence of unanimous tradition for Domitian, and in the absence
of any counter-tradition, we can hardly understand him otherwise.

Clement in these words
asserts the truth of the story which he relates. We cannot regard it
as very strongly corroborated, for no one else records it, and yct we
can hardly doubt that Clement gives it in good faith. . It may have
been an invention of some early §o.i. it is so sully in accord
with what we know of John's character that there exists no reason
for refusing to believe that at least a groundwork of truth underlies
it, even though the story may have gained in the telling of it... It is

watchfulness, with the idea that in putting upon
him the seal of the Lord" he had given him
hand, the passages which reveal a distinction between presbyters
and bishops are very early, and are adduced not merely by prela
tists, '...}. such disinterested scholars as Harnack (in his trans
lation of Hatch's Organization of the Early Christian Churches)
as proving that there was from the beginning a difference of some
sort between a bishop and a presbyter.
I cannot enter here into a
discussion of the various views in regard to the original relation
between bishops and presbyters.
I desire simply to suggest a theory
of my own, leaving the fuller exposition of it for some future time.
My theory is that the word mpeo Burepos was originally employed in
the most general sense to indicate any church officer, thus practi
cally equivalent to the hyousuevos of Heb. xiii. 17, and the motu my
of Eph. iv. 11. The terms on taxonos and 8taxovos, on the other
hand, were employed to designate specific church officers charged
with the performance of specific duties. . If this were so, we should
expect the general term to be used before the particular designa
tions, and this is just what we find in the New Testament. We
should expect further that the general term and the specific terms
might be used by the same person in the same context, accord
ing as he thought of the officers in general or of a particular division
of the officers; on the other hand the general term and one of the spe
cific terms could never be co-ordinated (we could never find "presby
ter and bishop," "presbyter and deacon ''), but we should expect
to find the specific terms §. co-ordinated ("bishops and deacons").
An examination of the Epistle to the Philippians, of the Pastoral
Epistles, of Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians, and of the Didache
will show that our expectations are fully realized.
This theory
explains the fact that so frequently presbyters and bishops seem to
be identical (the general and the specific term might of course in
used interchangeably), and also the fact that so
many cases
frequently they seem to be quite distinct.
It explains still further
the remarkable fact that while in the first century we never find a
distinction in official rank between bishops and presbyters, that dis
tinction appears early in the second. . In many churches it must
early have become necessary to o some of the officers as a
special committee to take charge of the economic affairs of the con
regation. The members of such a committee might very naturally
§. given the special name on to kowo (see Hatch's discussion of the
use of this word in his work already referred to).
In some churches
the duties might be of such a character that the bishops would need
assistants (to whom it would be natural to give the name 6taxovos),
and such assistants would of course be closely, associated with the
bishops, as we find them actually associated with them in the second
and following centuries (a fact which Hatch has emphasized). Of
course where the bishops constituted a special and smaller commit
tee of the general body, entrusted with such important duties, they
would naturally acquire especial influence and power, and thus the
chairman of the committee - the chairman of the bishops as such,

As the power was thus concentrated in his hands, the committee of
bishops as such would cease to be necessary, and he would require
only the deacons, who should carry out his directions in economic
matters, as we find them doing in the second century. The elevation
of the bishop would of course separate him from the other officers in
such a way that although still a presbyter (i.e. an officer), he would
cease to be called longer by the general name.
In the same way
the deacons obliged to devote themselves to their specific duties,
would cease to have much to do with the more general functions of
the other officers, to whom finally the name presbyter - originally
a general term - would be confined, and thus become a distinctive

general disciplinary functions which had belonged from the begin:
ning to the entire body of officers as such, and their rank would
naturally be second only to that of the bishop, for the deacons as
assistants only, not independent officers, could not outrank them
(though they struggled hard in the third and fourth centuries to do
so).
It is of course likely that in a greaf many churches the simple
undivided office would long remain, and that bishops and deacons as
specific officers distinguished from the general body would not exist.
#. aster the distinction between the three orders had been sharply
drawn in one part of Christendom, it must soon spread throughout
the Church and become established even in places where it had not
been produced by a natural process of evolution. The Church
organization of the second century is thus complete, and its further
development need not concern us here, for it is not matter of contro
versy. Nor is this the place to show how thc, local church officers
gradually assumed the spiritual functions which belonged originally
to apostles, prophets, and teachers. The Didache is the document
which has shed most light upon that process, and Harnack in his
edition of it has done most to make the matter clear.

he was thus prematurely freed from restraint.
At first they enticed him by costly entertain

robbery, they took him with them, and finally
they demanded that he should unite with
them in some greater crime. He gradually
became accustomed to such practices, and

tell us that Paul wrote no more than what we have in the canon.
But this is a mistake, for Origen (quoted by Eusebius in VI. 25, be
low) states it just as distinctly as Eusebius does. The truth is, neither
of them says it directly, and yet it is clear enough when this passage
is taken in connection with chapter 3, that it is what Eusebius meant,
and the same idea underlies the statement of the Muratorian Frag
ment. Of course this does not prove that Paul wrote only the epis

what the idea of the early Church was.

when Mark and Luke had already published

evident that the three evangelists recorded
only the deeds done by the Saviour for one year
after the imprisonment of John the Baptist," and

many, is at present the prevailing opinion among scholars, and may
be accepted as a fact both on account of its intrinsic probability and
of the testimony of the Fathers, which begins with the statement of
Papias, quoted § Eusebius in chap. 39, below, is confirmed by Ire
natus }}. 1. 1, quoted below, V. 8, § 2), - whether independently
of Papias or not, we cannot say, - by Pantaenus (but see below,
Bk. y chap. 10), by Origen (see below, VI. 25), by Jerome (de vir.
to. 3), - who says that a copy of it still existed in the library at
Caesarea, - and by Epiphanius (Haer. XXIX. 9). The question as
to the relation of this Hebrew original to our present Greek Matthew
is much more difficult. That our Greek Matthew is a mere transla
tion of the original Hebrew was once a prevailing theory, but is now
completely abandoned. That Matthew himself wrote both is a com
mon conservative position, but is denied by most critical scholars,
many of whom deny him the composition even of the Hebrew orig
inal. Upon the theory that the original Hebrew Matthew was identi
cal with the "Gospel according to the Hebrews," see chap. 27, note
8. Upon the synoptic problem, see above, II, 15, note 4; and see
the works mentioned there for a discussion of this original Matthew,
and in addition the recent works by Gla, Original-Sarache des Matt.
Aezang., 1887, and Resch, sos"; Leipzig, 1889.

The very natural reason which Eusebius gives for the composi
tion of Matthew's Gospel - viz. that, when on the point of going to
other nations, he committed it to writing, and |. compensated
them for the loss of his presence - occurs in none of the earlier re
ports of the composition of the Gospel which we now possess.
It
was probably a fact which he took from common tradition, as he re
marks in the previous sentence that tradition says "they undertook
it from necessity."
* Upon the date and authorship of the Gospel of Luke, see above,
chap. 4, notes 12 and 15. Upon Mark, see i. II. chap. 15, note 4.
7 No writer before ñus. time, so far as is known, assigned
the reason given by him for the composition of John's, Gospel.
Jerome, de Vir. ill. chap. 9, repeats the view, combining with it the
anti-heretical purpose. The indefinite expression, "they say," shows
that Eusebius was recording tradition commonly received in his
time, and does not involve the authority of any particular writer.
This object - viz. the supplementing and filling out of the accounts
of the Synoptists - is assumed as the real object by some modern
scholars; but it is untenable, for though the book serves this pur
pose to a great extent, the author's real aim was much higher, - viz.
the establishment of belies in the Messiahship and divinity of Christ
§: xx. 31 sqq.), - and he chose his materials accordingly. The
Muratorian Fragment says, "The Fourth Gospel is that of John,
one of the disci i. When his fellow-disciples and bishops entreated
him, he said, "Fast ye now with me for the space of three days, and
let us recount to each other whatever may be revealed to us." On
the same night it was revealed to Andrew, one of the apostles, that
John should narrate all things in his own name as they called them
to mind."
Irenaeus (III. 11.1) supposes John to have written his
Gospel as a polemic against Cerinthus. Clement of Alexandria, in
his Hypoty/oses (quoted by Eusebius, VI. 14), savs that John wrote
a *:::...'... as a supplement to the other Gospels, which had
sufficiently described the external facts. The opinion of Eusebius
is very superficial. Upon examination of the Gospels it will be seen
that, of the events which John relates independently of the synop
tists, but a small portion occurred before the imprisonment of John

early Fathers, - e.g. Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen,
Lactantius, &c.
John, however, expressly mentions three, perhaps
four. passovers, so that Christ's ministry fasted either, two or three
years. Upon comparison of the Synoptists with John, it will be

fast and the temptation which followed it,
indicates the chronology of his work when he
says: "Now when he heard that John was deliv
ered up he withdrew from Judea into Gali
lee."" Mark likewise says: "Now after
that John was delivered up Jesus came into
Galilee."" And Luke, before commencing his
account of the deeds of Jesus, similarly marks
the time, when he says that Herod, "adding to
all the evil deeds which he had done, shut
up John in prison."" They say, therefore,
that the apostle John, being asked to do it
for this reason, gave in his Gospel an account of
the period which had been omitted by the earlier
evangelists, and of the deeds done by the Saviour
during that period; that is, of those which were
done before the imprisonment of the Baptist.
And this is indicated by him, they say, in the
following words: "This beginning of miracles
did Jesus"; * and again when he refers to the
Baptist, in the midst of the deeds of Jesus, as
still baptizing in AEnon near Salim ; " where he
states the matter clearly in the words: "For
John was not yet cast into prison."" John
accordingly, in his Gospel, records the deeds
of Christ which were performed before the Bap
tist was cast into prison, but the other three
evangelists mention the events which hap
pened after that time.
One who under
stands this can no longer think that the
Gospels are at variance with one another, inas
much as the Gospel according to John contains
the first acts of Christ, while the others give an
account of the latter part of his life. And the
genealogy of our Saviour according to the flesh
John quite naturally omitted, because it had
been already given by Matthew and Luke, and
began with the doctrine of his divinity, which
had, as it were, been reserved for him, as
their superior, by the divine Spirit." These
things may suffice, which we have said con
cerning the Gospel of John. The cause which led
to the composition of the Gospel of Mark has
been already stated by us." But as for Luke,
in the beginning of his Gospel, he states
himself the reasons which led him to write it.

seen that the events which they record are not all comprised within
a single year, as Eusebius thought, but that they are scattered over
the whole period of his ministry, although confined to his work, in
Galilee up to the time of his last journey to Judea, six months be
fore his crucifixion. The distinction between John, and the Synop
tists, as to the events recorded, is therefore rather that of place than
of time; but the distinction is not absolute.

He states that since many others had more
rashly undertaken to compose a narrative of the
events of which he had acquired perfect knowl
edge, he himself, feeling the necessity of freeing
us from their uncertain opinions, delivered in
his own Gospel an accurate account of those
events in regard to which he had learned the
full truth, being aided by his intimacy and his
stay with Paul and by his acquaintance with
the rest of the apostles."
So much for our
own account of these things. But in a more
fitting place we shall attempt to show by quota
tions from the ancients, what others have said

concerning them.

But the other two

In regard to the Apoc

Eusebius puts the case more strongly than
Luke himself. Luke does not say that others had rashly undertaken
the composition of their narratives, nor does he say that he himself
writes in order to free his readers from the uncertain suppositions of
others; but at the same time the interpretation which Eusebius gives
is, though not an exact, yet certainly a natural one, and we have no
right to accuse him, as has been done, of intentional falsification of
the text of the Gospel.
Eusebius also augments Luke's statement
by the mention of i. source from which thc latter gained his knowl
edge, viz., "from his intimacy and stay with Paul, and from his ac
quaintance with the rest of the apostles." If Eusebius intended to con
vey the impression that Luke said this, he is of course inexcusable, but
we have no reason to suppose this to be the case.
It is simply the
explanation on the part of Eusebius of an indefinite statement of
Luke's by a fact which was universally assumed as true. That he
was adding to Luke's own account ... never occurred to him.
He does not pretend to quote Luke's exact words.

* The testimony to the first Epistle of John goes hand in hand
with that to the fourth Gospel (cf. note 1, above).
But we can find
still clearer trace of the Epistle in the early part of the second cen:
tury than of the Gospel (e.g. in Polycarp's Epistle, where traces of
the Gospel are wanting; and so, too, in Papias, ...?"; to chap.
39, below). . The writings of the second century are full of the spirit
; the Epistle as well as of the Gospel, and exhibit frequent parallels
in language too close to be mistaken. The first express testimony
as to its authorship occurs in the Muratorian Fragment. The first
systematic attack upon the Epistle was made by Bretschneider, in
1820, in connection with the attack upon the Gospel. The Tübingen
school likewise rejected both.
Before Bretschneider there had been
a few critics (e.g. Lange, 1797) who had rejected the Epistle while
accepting the Gospel, and since then a sew have accepted the Epistle
while rejecting the Čospel; but these are exceptional cases. The
Gospel and Epistle have almost universally, and quite rightly, been
regarded as the work of the same author, and may be said to stand
or fall together.
Cf. the works cited in note 1, and also Westcott's
Fostles of St. John. (On the use of n potepa instead of n poorn, see
p. 388, note.)

* The Muratorian Fragment expressly ascribes two epistles to
John.
Citations from the second Epistle appear first in Irenaeus,
though he does not distinguish it from the first. Clement of Alex.
andria (Strom. II. 15) quotes from 1 John under the formula "John
says in his larger Epistle," showing that he knew of a second. The
lack of citations from the second and third Epistles is easily explained
by their brevity and the minor importance of their doctrinal contents.
The second and third Epistles belong to the seven Antogomena.
Origen cites the first Epistle often, the second and third never, and
of the latter he says "not all agree that they are genuine" (quoted
by Eusebius, VI. 25), and apparently he ãof did not consider
them of apostolic origin. (cf. Weiss' Einleitung, p. 87).
Origen's
treatment of the Čiji. Epistles was implicitly fixed by his
pupil Dionysius and by succeeding generations. , Eusebius himself
does not express his own judgment in the matter, but simply records
the state of tradition which was a mere repetition of Origen's posi
tion in regard to them. Jerome (de vior. ill. 9 and 18) says that
most writers ascribe them to the presbyter John - an opinion
which evidently arose upon the basis of the author's self-designation
in 2 John I, and 3 John I, and some modern critics (among them
Reuss and Wieseler) have done the same.
Eusebius himself in the
next chapter implies that such an opinion existed in his day, though
he does not express his own view on the matter. He placed them,
(On the presbyter John, see
however, among the Antolegorzema.
below, chap. 39, note 4.) That the two epistles fell originally into
the class of Anti'egointerta was due doubtless to the peculiar self
designation mentioned, which seemed to distinguish the author from
the apostle, and also to their private and doctrinally unimportant

alypse, the opinions of most men are still di
But at the proper time this question
vided."

But in spite of the slight external testimony to the epis
character.
tles the conclusion of Weiss seems correct, that "inasmuch as the
second and third clearly betray the same author, and inasmuch as
the second is related to the first in such a manner that they must
either be by the same author or the former be regarded as an entirely
aimless imitation of the latter, so everything favors the ascription of
them both to the author of the first, viz. to the apostle." (złod. p. 469.)

Fathers, and already by Justin Martyr was expressly ascribed to the
apostle John... (Compare also the epistle of the Churches, of Lyons
and Vienne, Eusebius, V. 1.)
Tradition, so far as we have it, is
unanimous (with the exception of the Alogi, an insignificant hereti
cal sect of the second century, who attributed the Apocalypse as well
as the Gospel to Cerinthus.
Caius is not an exception; see below,
chap. 28, note 4) in ascribing the Apocalypse to the apostle John,
until Dionysius of Alexandria, who subjected the book to severe
literary criticism (see below, Bk. VII, chap. 25), and upon the as
sumption of the genuineness of the Gospel and the first Epistle,
doubted its authenticity on account of its divergence from these
writings, both in spirit and in style. . He says (VII. 25, § 2) that
some others before him had denied the Johanninc authorship and
ascribed the book to Cerinthus, but the way in which he speaks of
them shows that, there cannot have been a ruling tradition to that
effect. He may have referred simply to the Alogi, or he may have
included others of whom we do not know. He himself rejects this
hypothesis, and supposes the books to have been written by some
John, not the apostle (by what John he does not decide), and does
not deny the inspiration and prophetic character of the book. Di
onysius was led to exercise criticism upon the Apocalypse (which
was as well supported by tradition as any book of the New Testa
ment) from dogmatic reasons. The supposed sensuous and material
istic conceptions of the Apocalypse were offensive to the spiritual
izing tendencies of the |. school, and the offensiveness
increased with time. Although Dionysius held the work as inspired
and authoritative, yet his position would lead logically to the ex
clusion of the Apocalypse from the canon, just as #. had been
already excluded, although Origen held it to be inspired and authori.
tative in the same sense in which Dionysius held §. Apocalypse to
, - i.e. as composed by an apostle's pupil, not by an apostle. Apoc
alyptic literature did not belong properly to the New Testament, but
rather to the prophetic portion of the Old Testament; but the number
of the Old Testament prophets was already complete (according to
the Muratorian Fragment), and therefore no prophetic writing (e.g.
Hermas) could find a place there; nor, on the other hand, could it be
made a part of the New Testament, for it was not apostolic. The same
was true of the Apocalypse of Peter, and the only thing which kept the
Apocalypse of John in the canon was its supposed apostolic author
ship.
It was received as a part of the New Testament not because it
was apocalyptic, but because it was apostolic, and thus the criticism
of Dionysius would lead logically to its rejection from the canon.
John's Apocalypse is the only New Testament book cited by Justin
as Ypaq m (so also by the Epistle of Vienne and Lyons, Eusebius, V.
1), and this because of its prophetic character.
It must have been
(according to their opinion) either a true prophecy (and therefore
inspired by the Holy Spirit) or a forgery.
Its authenticity being
accepted, the former alternative necessarily followed, and it was
placed upon a line with the Old Testament prophets, i.e. with the
Yp 1% j. After Dionysius' time doubts of its authenticity became
quite widespread in the Eastern Church, and among the doubters
was Eusebius, who evidently wished to ascribe it to the mysterious
presbyter John, whose existence he supposed to be §. by

It

testimonies in favor of its authenticity (see the next note), and only in
chapter 39 does he state clearly his own opinion in the matter, which

the doubts of the book's genuineness on the part of Eusebius and so

one of the five genuine monuments of the apostolic age, and from it
as a basis conducted their attacks upon the other Johannine writ
ings. The more modern critical school is doubtful about it as well
as the rest of the Johannine literature, and the latest theory makes
the Apocalypse a Jewish document in a Christianized form (see
above, chap. 18, note 1). Compare especially Holtzmann's Ein

e also
cites opinions favorable to the authenticity of the Apocalypse from
Justin (in IV. 18, below), Theophilus (IV. 24), Irenaeus (V. 8), and
Origen (VI. 25), but such scattered testimonies can hardly be re
garded as the fulfillment of the definite promise which he makes in
this passage.

treat the canon systematically, and in it he is speaking purely as an
historian, not as a critic.
e is endeavoring to give an accurate
statement of the general opinion of the orthodox Church of his day
in regard to the number and names of its sacred books.
e does
not, in this passage, apply to the various works any criterion of
canonicity further than their acceptance as canonical by the ortho
dox Church. He simply records i. state of the canon; he does not
endeavor to form a canon. He has nothing to do, therefore, with
the nature and origin of the books which i. church accepts. As
remarked by Weiss ### fu das V. T., p. 96), the influence
of Eusebius in the formation of the canon is very commonly over
estimated. He contributed himself very little; his office was to re
cord the usage of the church of his age, not to mould it.
The church whose judgment he takes is, in the main, the church
of the Orient, and in to: church at this time all the works which we
now call canonical (and only those) were already commonly ac
cepted, or were becoming more and more widely accepted as such.
From the standpoint, then, of canonicity, Eusebius divided the
works, which he mentions in this chapter into two classes: the
canonical (including the Homologoumena and the Antilegomena)
and the ofoić. the voto, and the avanadquare aipo

the Homodogor, mena and Antilegomena than with the heretical
works, ...; are, in fact, separated from all the rest and placed in a
class by themselves. What, then, is the relation of the //omologou
mena, A utilegomena, and vô6ot to each other, as Eusebius classi
fies them? The crucial point is the relation of the vo0ot to the
avrixeygueva. , Lücke (Ueber den M. T. Kanon des Eusebius, p.
11 sq.) identified the two, but such identification is impossible in this
passage.
The passages which he cites to confirm his view prove
only that the word Anti-gonicua is commonly employed by Euse.
bius in a general sense to include all disputed works, and therefore,
of course, the voeot also; that is, the term Aztti/egomera is ordi
narily used, not as identical with vö8ot, but as inclusive of it.
This,
however, establishes nothing as to Eusebius' technical use of the
words in the present passage, where he is endeavoring to draw close
distinctions.
Various views have been taken since Liicke's time
upon the relation of these terms to each other in this connection;
but, to me at least; none of them seem satisfactory, and I have been
led to adopt the following simple explanation. The Amtrsegomena,
in the narrower sense peculiar to this summary, were works which, in
Eusebius' day, were, as he believed, commonly accepted by the East
ern Church as canonical, but which, nevertheless, as he well knew,
had not always been thus accepted, and, indeed, were not even then
universally accepted as such. The tendency, however, was distinctl
in the direction of their ever-wider acceptance. On the other .
the vo90t were works which, although they had been used by the
Fathers, and were quoted as ypadon by some of them, were, at this
time, not oil. as canonical.
Although perhaps not uni
versally rejected from the canon, yet they were commonly so re
jected, and the tendency was distinctly in the direction of their ever
wider rejection. Whatever their merit, and whatever their antiquity
and their claims to authenticity, Eusebius could not place them
among the canonical books. The term robot, then, in this passage,

the works referred to; o in the present case, is not his concern.
As an historian he observed tendencies, and judged accordingly.
He saw that the authority of the Antilegomena was on the increase,
that of the vö8ot on the decrease, and already he could draw a sharp
distinction between them, as Clement of Alexandria could not do a
century before. The distinction drawn has no relation to the au

#. interpretation will help us to understand the peculiar way
in which Eusebius treats the Apocalypse, and thus his treatment of
it becomes an argument in favor of the interpretation. He puts it,
first, among the Homologos, mena with an etye bawe in, and then
among the v68ot with an et bavein. No one, so far as I know, has
explained why it should be put among the votov as an alternative
to the Homo/ogoumena, instead of among the Antilegomena, which,

clear. The Antilesomena were those works which had been dis
puted, but were becoming more and more widely accepted as canoni
cal. The Apocalypse could not, under any circumstances, fall into
this class, for the doubts raised against it in the orthodox Church
were of recent date.
It occupied, in fact, a peculiar position, for
there was no other work which, while accepted as canonical, was
doubted in the present more than in the past.
Eusebius then must
either put it into a special class or put it conditionally into two dis.

ferent classes, as he does.
spread as to destroy its canonicity, it would fall naturally into the
vo90s, for then it would hold the same position as the other works of
that class. As an historian, Eusebius sees the tendency and un
doubtedly has the idea that the Apocalypse may eventually, like the
other Christian works of the same class (the Shepherd, o: Apoca
lypse of Peter, etc.), become one of the voto, one of the works
which, formerly accepted, is at length commonly, denied to be
canonical: and so, as an historian, he presents the alternative.
The Apocalypse was the only work in regard to which any doubt
could exist.

Eusebius' failure to mention explicitly in this passage the Epistle
to the Hebrews, has caused considerable misunderstanding. The
explanation, if the view presented be adopted, is simple.
Eusebius
included it, I believe, among the epistles of Paul, and did not cspe
cially mention it, simply because there was no dispute about its
canonicity. . Its Pauline authorship had been widely disputed, as
Eusebius informs us elsewhere, and various theories had been pro
posed to account for it; but its canonicity had not been doubted in
the orthodox Church, and therefore doubts as to the authorship of
it did not in the least endanger its place among the Homo/cgow, mena,
as used here in a technical sense; and since Eusebius was simply
stating the works of each class, not discussing the nature and origin
of those works, he could, in perfect fairness, include it in Paul's
epistles (where he himself believed it belonged) without entering
upon any discussion of it.

Another noticeable omission is that of the Epistle of Clement to

Epistle of Barnabas, etc., as Eusebius' treatment of it in other pas
sages shows.
It must be assumed, with Holtzmann, that the omis
sion of it was nothing more nor less than an oversight.

Eusebius, then, classifies the works mentioned in this chapter
upon two principles: first, in relation to canonicity, into the canoni
cal and the uncanonical; and secondly, in relation to character, into
the orthodox (//eurosogone mena, .olnts/cg," coma, which are canoni
cal, and vot/ot, which are uncanonical), and heterodox (which are
not, and never have been, canonical, never have been accepted as
of use or authority). The Honologousnesia and Antilegomena,
then, are both canonical and orthodox, the avam Aaguaro at per kov
&vöpov are neither canonical nor orthodox, while the to 8ot occupy
a peculiar position, being orthodox but not canonical. The last
named are much more closely related to the canonical than to the
heterodox works, because when the canon was a less concretc and
exact thing than it had at length become, they were associated with
the other orthodox works as, like them, useful for edification and
instruction. With the heretical works they had never been asso
ciated, and possessed in common with them only the negative char
acteristic of non-canonicity.
Eusebius naturally connects them
closely with the former, and severs them completely stom the latter.
The only reason for mentioning the latter at all was the fact that
they bore the names of apostles, and thus might be supposed, as
they often had been - by Christians, as well as by unbelievers -
to be sacred books like the rest. The statement of the canon gives
Eusebius an opportunity to warn his readers against them.

without a dissenting voice, ascribes it to Barnabas, the companion

But this testimony, although unanimous, is neither very
strong nor very extensive. The first to use the epistle is Clement
of Alexandria, who expressly and frequently ascribes it to Barnabas
the companion of Paul.

what Eusebius thought in regard to its authorship.
His putting it
among the vo93, here does not prove that he considered it unauthen
tic (see note I, above); nor, on the other hand, does his classing it
among the A attlegomena just below prove that he considered it
authentic, but non-apostolic, as some have claimed.
Although,
therefore, the direct external testimony which we have is in favor of
the apostolic Barnabas as its author, it is to be noticed that there
must have existed a widespread doubt as to its authenticity, during
the first three centuries, to have caused its complete rejection from
the canon before the time of Eusebius. That this rejection arose
from the fact that Barnabas was not himself one of the twelve apos
tles cannot be.
For apostolic authorship was not the sole test of
canonicity, and Barnabas stood in close enough relation to the apos
tles to have secured his work a place in the canon, during the period
of its gradual formation, had its authenticity been undoubted. We
may therefore set this inference over against the direct external tes.
timony for Barnabas' authorship. When we come to internal testi
mony, the arguments are conclusive against "the Levite Barnabas"
as the author of the epistle. These arguments have been well stated
by Donaldson, in his //istory of CA Post to a Literatore, I. p.
234 s 11.
Milligan, in Smith and Wace's Dict. of Christ. Hoog,
endeavors to break the force of these arguments, and concludes that
the authenticity of the epistle is highly prob able; but his positions
are far from conclusive, and he may be said to stand almost alone
among modern scholars.
Especially during the last few years, the
verdict against the epistle's authenticity has become practically
unani mous. Some have supposed the author to have been an un
known man by the name of Barn bas; but this is pure conjecture.
Tn at the author lived in Alex undria is apparently the ruling opin
ion, and is quite probable.
It is certain that the epistle was writ

of Clement of Alexandria: almost certain that it was written be.

ten between 192 and 123, though dates ranging all the way from the

It

The Teaching of the
Twelve Apostles, Avôaxm Tøw 603exa a mogróAov, a brief document
in sixteen chapters, was published in 1884 by Philotheos Bryennios,
Metropolitan of Nicomedia, from a MS. discovered by him in the
Jerusalem convent in Constantinople in 1873. The discovery threw
the whole theological world into a state of excitement, and the books
and articles upon the subject from America and from every nation
in Europe have appeared by the hundred. No such important find
has been made for many years. The light which the little document
has thrown upon early Church history is very great, while at the
same time the questions which it has opened are numerous and
weighty. Although many points in regard to its origin and nature
are still undecided, the following general positions may be accepted
as practically established.
It is composed of two parts, of which the
former (chaps. 1-6) is a redaction of an independent moral treatise,
probably of Jewish origin, entitled the Two Isays, which was known
and used in Alexandria, and there formed the basis of other writings
(e.g. the Epistle of Barnabas, chaps. 18-21, and the Ecclesiastical
Cantons) §. were at first supposed to have been based upon the
Teaching itself.
(Bryennios, Harnack, and others supposed that
the Teaching was based upon Barnabas, but this view has never
been widely accepted.)
This (Jewish) Two Jays which was in
existence certainly before the end of the first century (how much
earlier we do not know) was early in the second century (if not before)
made a part of a primitive church manual, viz. our present Teach
ing of the Twelve Apostles. The Two Isays, both before and at
the time of (perhaps after) its incorporation into the Teaching, re
ceived important additions, partly of a Christian character. The
completed Teaching dates from Syria, though this is denied by
many writers (e.g. by Harmack), who preser, upon what seem to me
insufficient grounds, Egypt as the place of composition.
The com
pleted Teaching formed the basis of a part of the seventh book of
the Apostelic Constitutions, which originated in Syria in the fourth
century. The most complete and useful edition is that of Schaff
ed., New York,
(The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, 3d
1889), which contains the Greek text with English translation and a
very full discussion of the work itself and of the various questions
which are affected by its discovery.
Harnack's important edition
Die Lehre der zwódź - 1/asted (Terte uno' (Waterstock ungen zur
Gesch. der altch rost. Lit., II. 1 and 2, 1884) is still the standard
German work upon the subject, though it represents man
si
tions in regard to the origin and history of the work . ave
since been proved incorrect, and which he himself has given up.
His article in Herzog, 2d ed., XVII: 656 sqq. and his Pie A fostel
Zehre und affe jitosch cut Beiden JP'ege, 1886, should therefore be
compared with his original work. Schaff's book contains a very com
plete digest of the literature down to the close of 1888. As to the
position which the Teaching occupied in the canon we know very
little, on account of the very sparing use of it made by the early
Fathers. . Clement of Alexandria cites it once as Scripture (Ypaq m),
but no other writer before the time of Eusebius treats it in the same
way, and yet Eusebius' mention of it among the voto shows that it
must have enjoyed a wide circulation at some time and have been
accepted by at least a portion of the Church as a book worthy to be
read in divine service, and thus in a certain sense as a part of the
canon.,
In, Eusebius' time, however, its canonicity had been de
nied (though according to Athanasius Fest. Fo. 39, it was still used
in catechctical instruction), and he was therefore obliged to relegate it
to a position among the voto. Upon Eusebius' use of the plural
ôtéaxat, see the writer's article in the Andover Rezicze, April,

The existing material upon which

It is certain, how

many little marks of originality over against our Greek Matthew to
admit of such a supposition.
That it was, on the other hand, the

That it was the original source from which
Matthew and Luke derived their common matter is possible - more

Tots refers rather to the votos among which its earlier acceptance by
a large part of the Church, but present uncanonicity, places it by
right.
I renaeus expressly states that there were but four canonical
gospels (Aldo. Haer. III. 2, 8), so also Tertullian (Adv. Marc. IV.
), while Clement of Alexandria cites the gospel with the same
ormula which he uses for the Scriptures in general, and evidently
looked upon it as, if not quite, at least almost, on a par with the
other four Gospels. Origen on the other hand (in johan. II. 6,
Afont. in jer. XV.4, and often) clearly places it upon a footing
lower than that of the four canonical Gospels. Upon the use of the
gospel by the Ebionites and upon its relation to the Hebrew Gospel
of Matthew, see chap. 27, note 8.

The literature upon the Gospel according to the Hebrews is very
extensive. Among recent discussions the most important are by
Hilgenfeld, in his Evange/ien mach threr Aettstes, ung (1854); in
the Zeitschrift /, wiss. Theol., 1863, p. 345 sqq.; in his A. T.

* Eusebius so far as we know is the first writer to refer to these
Acts.
But they are mentioned after him by Epiphanius, Philaster,
and Augustine (see Tischendorf's Acta AAost. Apoc. p. xl.). The
Acts of Andrew (Acta Andraeae) were of Gnostic origin and circu
lated among that sect in numerous editions. The oldest extant
portions (both in Greek and somewhat fragmentary) are the Acts of
Andrew and Matthew (translated in the Ante-A scene Fathers,
VIII. 517-525) and the Acts of Peter and Andrew (?&nd. 526-527).
The Acts and Martyrdom of the Holy Apostle Andrew (ibid.
511-516), or the so-called Epistle of the Presbyters and Deacon's
of 4 chara concerning the Passion of A *drew, is a later work, still
extant in a Catholic recension in both Greek and Latin. The frag
ments of these three are given by Tischendorf in his Acta Apost.
:/o. p. 195 sqq. and 132 sqq., and in his Apocal. Apoc. p. 161 sq.
See Lipsius in the Pict. of Christ. Biog. I. p. 30.

* Eusebius is likewise, so far as we know, the first writer to
refer to these Acts.
But they are afterward mentioned by Epipha
nius, Photius, Augustine, Philaster, &c. (see Tischendorf, ičia. p.
lxxiii.). They are also of Gnostic origin and extant in a few frag
ments (collected by Thilo, Fragmenta Actron S. Johann is a
Aleucio Cha rioto conscriptorum, Halle, 1847). A Catholic extract

and is given by Tischendorf, Acta AAost. A/ec. p. 266 sq. (trans

The last two works mentioned belong to a collection of apocry
phal Acts which were commonly ascribed to Leucius, a fictitious
character who stands as the legendary author of the whole of this
class of Gnostic literature.
From the fourth century on, frequent
reference is made to various Gnostic Acts whose number must have
been enormous.

before the time of Eusebius, yet apparent traces of them are found

would partake even in the present life of perpet
ual immortality, and would never die, but would
remain here forever, and without growing old
become immortal." These facts can be easily
learned from the works of Irenaeus.' And
Justin, in the passage in which he mentions
Simon, gives an account of this man also, in the
following words : * "And we know that a certain
Menander, who was also a Samaritan, from the
village of Capparattea," was a disciple of Simon,
and that he also, being driven by the demons,
came to Antioch" and deceived many by his
magical art. And he persuaded his followers
that they should not die. And there are
still some of them that assert this." And it
was indeed an artifice of the devil to en
deavor, by means of such sorcerers, who assumed
the name of Christians, to defame the great mys

added.
Tertullian also mentions Menander (De Anima, 23, 50)
and his resurrection doctrine, but evidently knows only what Ire
naeus has already told; and so the accounts of all the early Fathers
rest wholly upon Justin and Irenaeus, and probably ultimately upon
Justin alone. See Salmon's article Menander in the Dict. of Christ.

A fog.fo Simon Magus, see above, Bk. II. chap. 13, note 3.

* "Instrument of diabolical power," is an embellishment of Euse
bius' own, quite in keeping with his usual treatment of heretics.
It
is evident, however, that neither Justin nor Irenaeus looked upon
Menander with any greater degree of allowance.

* Simon (Irenaeus, I. 23. 1) taught that he himself was the Su
preme Power; but Menander, according to Irenaeus (ibid. § 5), taught
that the Supreme Power continues. to all, but that he him
self (as Eusebius here says) was sent forth as a saviour for the de
liverance of men.

* He agreed with Simon in teaching that the world was formed
by angels who had taken their origin from the Ennaea of the Su
reme Power, and that the magical power which he imparted enabled
F. followers to overcome these creative angels, as Simon had taught
of himself before him.

* This baptism (according to Irenaeus "into his own name"),
and the promise of the resurrection, as a result, seem to have been
an original addition of Menander's. The exemption from death
taught by Menander was evidently understood by Irenaeus, Tertul
lian (De Anima, 5o), and Eusebius in its physical, literal sense;
but the followers § Menander must of course have put a spiritual
meaning upon it, or the sect could not have continued in existence
for any length of time.
It is certain that it was flourishing at the
time of Justin; how much longer we do not know. Justin him
self does not emphasize the physical element, and he undoubtedly
understood that |. immortality taught was spiritual simply. Hege

19 Menander's Antiochene activity is reported only by Justin.

The Heresy of the Ebionises."

THE evil demon, however, being unable

11 Cyril of Jerusalem (Cat. XVIII. 1) says that the denial of the
resurrection of the body was a peculiarly Samaritan heresy, and it
would seem therefore that the heresy of these Menandrianists was in
that direction, i.e. that they taught rather a spiritual immortality
and denied a bodily resurrection (as suggested in note 6); evidently,
however, this was not Eusebius' idea. He probably looked upon
them as discrediting the Christian doctrine of a resurrection by
teaching a physical immortality, which of course was soon proved
contrary to truth, and which thus, being confounded by the masses
with the doctrines of the Christians, brought the latter also into con:
tempt, and threw discredit upon immortality and resurrection of
every kind.

1. The Ebionites were not originally heretics.

Their characteris
tic was the more or less strict insistence upon the observance of the
Jewish law; a matter of cultus, therefore, not of theology, separated
them from Gentile Christians. Among the early Jewish Christiars
existed all shades of opinion, in regard to the relation of the law and
the Gospel, from the freest recognition of the uncircumcised Gentile
Christian to the bitterest insistence upon the necessity for salvation
of full observance of the Jewish law by Gentile as . as by Jewish
Christians. With the latter Paul himself had to contend, ard as
time went on, and Christianity spread more and more among the

were two opposite tendencies among such Christians as still chserved
the Jewish law: some wished to impose it upon all Christians;
others confined it to themselves. Upon the latter Justin looks with
charity; but the former he condemns as schismatics (see Dial. c.
Trypho. 47).
For Justin the distinguishing mark of such schis;
matics is not a doctrinal heresy, but an anti-Christian principle cf
life.
But the natural result of these Judaizing tendencies and of the
involved hostility to the apostle of the Gentiles was the ever more
tenacious clinging to the Jewish idea of the Messiah; and as the
Church, in its strife with Gnosticism, laid an ever-increasing stress
upon Christology, the difference in this respect between itself and
these Jewish Śā'ī. became ever more apparent, until finally,
left far behind by the Church in its rapid development, they were
looked upon as heretics. And so in Irenaeus (I. 26. 2) we find a
of Cerinthus and Carpocrates, who reject the apostle %. use the
definite heretical sect called Ebionites, whose Christology is like that
Gospel of Matthew only, and still cling to the observance of the
Jewish law; but the distinction which Justin draws between the
milder and stricter class is no longer drawn: all are classed together
in the ranks of heretics, because of their heretical Christology (cf.
foot. III. 21. 1; IV. 33. 4; V. 1.3).
In Tertullian and Hippolytus
their deviation from the orthodox Christology is still more clearly
emphasized, and their relation to the Jewish law drops still further
into the background (cf. Hippolytus, Phil. VII, 22; X. 18; and
Tertullian, Pe, Carne Christi, 14, 18, &c.). So Origen is ac
quainted with the Ebionites as an heretical sect, but, with a more
exact knowledge of them than was possessed by Irenaeus, who lived
far away from their chief centre, he distinguishes two classes; but
the distinction is made upon Christological lines, and is very difier
ent from that drawn by Justin. This distinction of Origen's be
tween those Ebionites who accepted and those who denied the super
natural birth of Christ is drawn also by Eusebius (see below, $3).
Epiphanius (Haer. XXIX. sqq.) is the first to make two distinct

custom of historians to carry this distinction back into apostolic
times, and to trace down to the time of Epiphanius the continuous
existence of a milder party-the Nazarenes-and of a stricter party
- the Ebionites; but this distinction Nitzsch (19eguie"gesch. p.
§ sqq.) has shown to be entirely groundless.
The division which
piphanius makes is different from that of Justin, as well as from
that of Origen and Eusebius; in fact, it is doubtful if he himself had
any clear knowledge of a distinction, his reports are so contradic
tory. The Ebionites known to him were most pronounced heretics:
less heretical, and
but he had heard of others who were said to
the conclusion that they formed another sect was most natural.
Jerome's use of the two words is fluctuating; but it is clear enough
that they were not looked upon by him as two distinct sects.
The
word "Nazarenes" was, in fact, in the beginning a general name given
to the Christians of Palestine by the Jews (cf. Acts xxiv. 5), and as
such synonymous with "Ebionites," Upon the latcrosyncretistic

to the Christ of God, yet found them susceptible
in a different direction, and so brought them over
to his own purposes. The ancients quite prop
erly called these men Ebionites, because they
held poor and mean opinions concerning
Christ."
For they considered him a plain
and common man, who was justified only
because of his superior virtue, and who was the
fruit of the intercourse of a man with Mary.
In
their opinion the observance of the ceremonial
law was altogether necessary, on the ground that
they could not be saved by faith in Christ
alone and by a corresponding life." There

Ebionism, see Bk. VI. chap. 38, note 1. Upon the general subject
of Ebionism, see especially No. *id., and Harnack, Dogment
gesch schte, I. p. 226 sqq.
* The word Ebionite comes from the Hebrew Tox, which signi
fies "poor." Different explanations more or less fanciful have been
given of the reason for the use of the word in this connection. It
occurs first in Irenaeus (I. 26. 2), but without a definition of its
meaning.
Origen, who uses the term often, gives different ex
planations, e.g., in Contra Celsum, II. 1, he says that the Jewish
converts received their name from the poverty of the law, "for Ebion
signifies Zoor among the Jews, and those Jews who have received
esus as Christ are called by the name of Ebionites."
In De Prin.
V. 1. 22, and elsewhere, he explains the name as referring to the
poverty of their understanding: The explanation given by Eusebius
refers to their assertion that Christ was only a common man, born
by natural generation, and applied only to the first class of Ebionites,
a description of whom follows.
For the same name as applied to
the second class (but see note 9) who accepted Christ's supernatural
birth, he gives a different reason at the end of the chapter, the same
which Origen gives for the application of the name to Ebionites in
general. The explanation given in this place is so far as we know
original with Eusebius (something similar occurs again in Epipha
nius, //arr. XXX. 17), and he shows considerable ingenuity in thus
treating the name differently in the two cases. . The various reasons
do not of course account for the existence of the name, for most of
them could have become reasons only long after the name was in
use.
Tertullian (/) e Praescr. Haer. 33, 19e Carne Christi, 14, 18,
&c.) and Hippolytus (in his Syntagma, - as can be gathered from
Pseudo-Tertullian, Adv. Harr. chap. 3, and Epiph. Hor. XXX., -
and also in his Phil. chap. 23, where he mentions Ebion inciden
tally) are the first to tell us of the existence of a certain Ebion from
whom the sect derived its name, and Epiphanius and later writers
are well acquainted with the man.
But Ebion is a myth invented
simply for the purpose of explaining the origin of Ebionism. The
name Ebionite was probably used in Jerusalem as a designation of
the Christians there, either applied to them by their enemies, as a
term of ridicule on account of their poverty in worldly goods, or,
what is inore probable, assumed by themselves as a term of honor, -
" the poor in spirit,"-or (as Epiphanius, XXX. 17, says the Ebio
nites of his day claimed) on account of their 'o'; taking pov
erty upon themselves by laying their goods at the feet of the apostles.
But, however the name originated, it became soon, as Christianity
spread outside of Palestine, the special designation of Jewish Chris
tians as such, and thus when they began to be looked upon as
heretical, it became the name of the sect.

* Eusebius clearly knew of no distinction in name between these
two classes of Ebionites such as is commonly made between Naza
... and Ebionites, - nor did Origen, whom he follows (see note 1,
above).

* That there were two different views among the Ebionites as to
the birth of Christ is stated frequently by Origen (cf. e.g. Contra
Cels. V. 61), but there was unanimity in the denial of his pre
existence and essential divinity, and this constituted the essence of
the heresy in the eyes of the Fathers from Irenaeus on.
Irenaeus, as
remarked above (note 1), knows of no such difference as Eusebius
here mentions; and that the denial of the supernatural birth even in
the time of Origen was in fact ordinarily attributed to the Ebionites
in general, without a distinction of the two classes, is seen by Ori
gen's words in his Hom. in Luc. XVII.

God, Word, and Wisdom, they turned aside into
the impiety of the former, especially when they,
like them, endeavored to observe strictly the
bodily worship of the law."
These men,
moreover, thought that it was necessary to
reject all the epistles of the apostle, whom they
called an apostate from the law;' and they
used only the so-called Gospel according to the
Hebrews" and made small account of the
rest. The Sabbath and the rest of the discipline of the Jews they observed just like
them, but at the same time, like us, they cele

Paul ...}. the Jewish law fell more and more into the background,
as remarked above, as their Christological heresy came into greater
prominence over against the developed Christology of the Catholic
Church (cf. e.g. the accounts of Tertullian and of Hippolytus with
that of Irenaeus).

The "these " (oirot &) here would seem to refer only to the
second class of Ebionites; but we know from the very nature of the
case, as well as from the accounts of others, that this conduct was
true as well of the first, and Eusebius, although he may have been
referring only to the second, cannot have intended to exclude the
first class in making the statement.

* Eusebius is the first to tell us that the Fbionites used the Gos
pel according to the Hebrews.
Irenaeus (A doz'. Harr. I. 26. 2, l l I.
11. 7) says that they used the Gospel of Matthew, and the fact that
he mentions no difference between it and the canonical Matthew
But according
shows that, so far as he knew, they were the same.
to Eusebius, Jerome, and o the Gospel according to the
Hebrews was used by the Ebionites, and, as seen above (chap. 25,
note 18), this Gospel cannot have been identical with the canonical
Matthew. . Either, therefore, the Gospel used by the Ebionites in
the time of Irenaeus, and called by him simply the Gospel of Mat
thew, was something different from the canonical Matthew, or else
the Ebionites had given up the Gospel of Matthew for another and a
different gospel (for the É. of the Hebrews cannot have been
an outgrowth of the canonical Matthew, as has been already seen,
chap. 25, note 24). The former is much more probable, and the diffi
culty may be most simply explained by supposing that the Gospel ac
cording to the Hebrews is identical with the so-called Hebrew §:
of Matthew (see chap. 24, note 5), or at least that it passed among the
earliest Jewish Christians under Matthew's name, and that Irenaeus,
who was personally acquainted with the sect, simply hearing that
they used a Gospel of Matthew, naturally supposed it to be identical
In the time of Jerome a Hebrew "Gos
with the canonical Gospel.
l, according to the Hebrews'' was used by the "Nazarenes and
£bionites" as the Gospel of Matthew (cf. in Matt. XII. 13; Contra
Pelag. III. 2). Jerome refrains from expressing his own judgment
as to its authorship, but that he did not consider it in its existing
form identical with the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew is clear from his
words in de zor. F. chap. 3, taken in connection with the fact that
he himself translated it into Greek and Latin, as he states in chap. 2.
Epiphanius (Har. XXIX.,9) says that the Nazarenes still preserved
the original Hebrew Matthew in full, while the Ebionites (XXX.
13) had a Gospel of Matthew "not complete, but spurious and mu
tilated ''; and elsewhere (XXX. 3) he says that the Ebionites used
the Gospel of Matthew and called it the "Gospel according to the
Hebrews."
It is thus evident that he meant to distinguish the Gos
pel of the Ebionites from that of the Nazarenes, i.e. the Gospel ac
cording to the Hebrews from the original Hebrew Matthew. So,
likewise, Eusebius' treatment of the Gospel according to the Hebrews
and of the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew clearly indicates that he con
sidered them two different gospels (cf. e.g. his mention of the former
in chap. 25 and in Bk. IV. chap. 22, and his mention of the latter in
chap. 24, and in Bk. IV. chap. 10). Of course he knew that the
former was not identical with the canonical Matthew, and hence,
naturally supposing that the Hebrew Matthew agreed with the ca
nonical Matthew, he could not do otherwise than make a distinction
between the Gospel according to the Hebrews and the Hebrew Mat
thew, and he must therefore make the change which he did in Ire
naeus' statement in mentioning the Gospel used by the Ebionites, as
he knew them.
Moreover, as we learn from Bk. VI. chap. 17, the
Ebionite Symmachus had written against the Gospel of Matthew (of
course the canonical Gospel), and this fact would only confirm Euse
bius in his opinion that Irenaeus was mistaken, and that the Ebion
ites did not use the Gospel of Matthew.

But none of these facts militate against the assumption that the
Gospel of the Hebrews, in its original form was identical with the
Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, or at least passed originally under his

CHAPTER XXVIII.

Cerinthus the Heresiarch.

WE have understood that at this time
Cerinthus," the author of another heresy,

name among Jewish Christians.
For it is by no means certain that
the original Hebrew Matthew agreed with the canonical Matthew,
and, therefore, lack of resemblance between the Gospel according to
the Hebrews and the canonical Matthew is no argument against its
identity with the Hebrew Matthew.
Moreover, it is quite conceiva
bl: that, in the course of time, the original Gospel according to the
Hebrews underwent alterations, especially since it was in the hands
of a sect which was growing constantly more heretical, and that,
therefore, its reseamblance to the canonical Matthew may have been
even less in the time of Eusebius and Jerome than at the beginning.
It is possible that the Gospel of Matthew, which Jerome claims to
have seen in the library at Caesarea (de var. zł. chap. 3), may have
e=n an earlier, and hence less corrupt, copy of the Gospel accord

in 3 to the Hebrews.

Since the writing of this note, Handmann's work on the Gospel
a : ; briding to the Hebrews (Das Hebräe r-Evange?ium, von Ru
dolf H and mann. Von Gebhardt and Harnack's o: und. Unter
st rh teng on, Bl. V. Hest 3) has come into my hands, and I find that
he denies that that Gospel is to be in any way identified with the
traditional Hebrew Matthew, or that it bore the name of Matthew.
The reasons which he gives, however, are practically the same as
those referred to in this note, and, as already shown, do not prove

I find that
Resch in his 4 grapha emphasizes the apocryphal character of the
Gospel in its original form, and makes it later than and in part de
pendent upon our Matthew, but I am unable to agree with him.

* The question again arises whether Fusebius is referring here
to the second class of Ebionites only, and is contrasting their con
dist in regard to Sabbath observance with that of the first class, or
whether he refers to all Ebionites, and contrasts them with the Jews.
The subject remains the same as in the previous sentence; but the
persons referred to are contrasted with oxerrot, whom they resemble
in their observance of the Jewish Sabbath, but from whom they
differ in their observance of the Lord's day. The most natural in
terpretation of the Greek is that which makes the ot, Tot 3e refer to
the second class of Ebionites, and the exei row to the first; and yet
we hear from no one else of two sharply defined classes separated
by religious customs, in addition to doctrinal opinions, and it is not
likely that they existed.
If this interpretation, however, seems nec
essary, we in ay conclude that some of them observed the Lord's
day, while others did not, and that Eusebius naturally identified the
former with the more, and the latter with the less, orthodox class,
with Put any especial information upon the subject.
It is easier, too,
to explain Eusebius' suggestion of a second derivation for the name
of Ebionite, if we assume that he is distinguishing here between the
two classes.
Having given above a reason for calling the first class
by that name, he now gives the reason for calling the second class
by the same.

* The earliest account which we have of Cerinthus is that of
Irenaeus (Adv. Harr. I. 26, 1 ; cf. III. 3, 4, quoted at the end of this
chapter, and 11. 1), according to which Cerinthus, a man educated
in i. wisdom of the Egyptians, taught that the world was not made
by the supreme God, but by a certain power distinct from him. He
denied the supernatural birth of Jesus, making him the son of Joseph
and Mary, and distinguishing him from Christ, who descended upon
him at baptism and left him again at his crucifixion. He was thus

Caius, whose words we
quoted above," in the Disputation which is as
cribed to him, writes as follows concerning
this man: "But Cerinthus also, by means
of revelations which he pretends were writ
ten by a great apostle, brings before us marvel
ous things which he falsely claims were shown
him by angels; and he says that after the resur

will again be subject to desires and pleasures.
And being an enemy of the Scriptures of God, he
asserts, with the purpose of deceiving men, that
there is to be a period of a thousand years" for
marriage festivals." " And Dionysius," who
was bishop of the parish of Alexandria in
our day, in the second book of his work On the
Promises, where he says some things concerning
the Apocalypse of John which he draws from
tradition, mentions this same man in the
following words:" "But (they say that)

Dionysius (quoted by Eusebius, VII. 25, below), y j.io.
(//aer. }...". 3), and by Augustine (/)e Haer. I. 8), from which
accounts we can see that those views were very sensual. The
fullest description which we have of Cerinthus and his followers is
that of Epiphanius (Haer. XXVIII.), who records a great many
traditions as to his life (e.g. that he was one of the false apostles
who opposed Paul, and one of the circumcision who rebuked Peter
for eating with Cornelius, &c.), and also many details as to his

that he was Jewish in his training and sympathies, while at the same
time possessed of Gnostic tendencies.
e represents a position of
transition from Judaistic Ebionism to Gnosticism, and may be re
garded as the earliest Judaizing Gnostic. Of his death tradition
tells us nothing, and as to his dates we can say only that he lived
about the end of the first century.
I renaeus (III. 2. 1) supposed
John to have written his gospel and epistle in opposition to Cerin
thus. On the other hand, Cerinthus himself was regarded by some
as the author of the Apocalypse (see Bk. VII. chap. 25, below),
and most absurdly as the author of the Fourth Gospel also (see
above, chap. 24, note 1).

there. The Prs,"utation is the same that is quoted in that passage.

chap. 39, note 19.

* It is a commonly accepted opinion founded upon this passage
that Gaius rejected the apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse and
considered it a work of Cerinthus.
But the quotation by no means
implies this. Had he believed that Cerinthus wrote the Apocalypse
commonly ascribed to John, he would certainly have said so plainly,
and Eusebius would just as certainly, have quoted his opinion, preju
diced as he was himself against the Apocalypse.
Caius simply
means that Cerinthus abused and misinterpreted the vision of the
Apocalypse for his own sensual purposes.
That this is the meanin
is plain from the words "being an enemy to the Divine Scriptures,'
and especially from the fact that in the joint Apocalypse itself
occur no such sensual visions as Caius mentions here. The sensu
ality was evidently superimposed by the interpretation of Cerinthus.

all in the infinitive, and we see, from Bk. VII. chap. 25, that they
depend upon an indefinite Aryovgov, "they say "; so that Eusebius
is quite right here in saying that Dionysius is drawing from tradition
in making the remarks which he does.
Inasmuch as the verbs are
not independent, and the statement is not, therefore, Dionysius' own,
I have inserted, at the beginning of the quotation, the words "they
say that," which really govern all the verbs of the passage. Diony

earthly one. And as he was himself devoted
to the pleasures of the body and altogether
sensual in his nature, he dreamed that that king
dom would consist in those things which he
desired, namely, in the delights of the belly and
of sexual passion, that is to say, in eating and
drinking and marrying, and in festivals and sac
rifices and the slaying of victims, under the guise
of which he thought he could indulge his appe
tites with a better grace." These are the
words of Dionysius.
But Irenaeus, in the
first book of his work Against Heresies,'
gives some more abominable false doctrines of
the same man, and in the third book relates a
story which deserves to be recorded. He says,
on the authority of Polycarp, that the apostle
John once entered a bath to bathe; but, learning
that Cerinthus was within, he sprang from the
place and rushed out of the door, for he could
not bear to remain under the same roof with him.
And he advised those that were with him to do
the same, saying, "Let us flee, lest the bath fall ;
for Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is within." "

At this time the so-called sect of the
Nicolaitans made its appearance and lasted
for a very short time.
Mention is made of it
in the Apocalypse of John.' They boasted that

7 Irenaeus, Adro. Haer. I. 26. 1.
* See ibid. III. 3. 4.

This story is repeated by Eusebius, in Bk.
IV. chap. 14. There is nothing impossible in it. The occurrence
fits well the character of John as a " son of thunder," and shows the
same spirit exhibited by Polycarp in his encounter with Marcion
(see below, Bk. IV. chap. 14).
But the story, is not very well au
thenticated, as Irenaeus did not himself hear it from Polycarp, but
only from others to whom Polycarp had told it. The unreliability
of such second-hand tradition is illustrated abundantly in the case of
Irenaeus himself, who gives some reports, very far from true, upon
the authority of certain presbyters (e.g. that Christ lived fifty years;
This same story, with much more fullness of detail, is
II. 22. 5).
repeated by Epiphanius %. XXX. 24), but of Ebion (who never
existed), instead of Cerinthus. This shows that the story was a
very common one, while, at the same time, so vague in its details as
to admit of an application to any heretic who suited the purpose:
That somebody met somebody in a bath seems quite probable, and
there is nothing to prevent our accepting the story as it stands in
Irenaeus, if we choose to do so. One thing, at least, is certain, -
that Cerinthus is a historical character, who in all probability was,
for at least a part of his life, contemporary with John, and thus
associated with him in tradition, whether or not he ever came into
personal contact with him.

* Rev. ii. 6, 15. Salmon, in his article Nicolaitans, in the Doct.
of Christ. Biog, states, as I think, quite correctly, that "there
really is no trustworthy evidence of the continuance of a sect so
called after the death of the apostle John "; and in this he is in
agreement with many modern scholars. An examination of extant
accounts of this sect seems to show that nothing more was known of
the Nicolaitans by any of the Fathers than what is told in the Apoc
alypse.
Justin, whose lost work against heretics Irenaeus follows in
his description of heresies, seems to have made no mention of the
Nicolaitans, for they are dragged in by Irenaeus at the close of the
text, quite out of their chronological place. I renaeus (I. 26. 3; III.
11. 1) seems to have made up his account from the Apocalypse, and
to have been the sole source for later writers upon this subject.
That the sect was licentious is told us by the Apocalypse. That
Nicolas, one of the Seven, was their founder is stated by Irenaeus (I.
26. 3), Hippolytus (VII. 24), Pseudo-Tertullian (Adv. omines Haer.
chap. 1), and Epiphanius (Harr. 25), the last two undoubtedly
drawing their account from Ho: and he in turn from Ire
noeus. Jerome and the writers of his time and later accept this view,
believing that Nicolas became licentious and sell into the greatest

the author of their sect was Nicolaus, one of the
deacons who, with Stephen, were appointed by
the apostles for the purpose of ministering to the
poor." Clement of Alexandria, in the third book
of his Stromata, relates the following things
concerning him." "They say that he had
a beautiful wife, and after the ascension of
the Saviour, being accused by the apostles of
jealousy, he led her into their midst and gave
permission to any one that wished to marry her.
For they say that this was in accord with that
saying of his, that one ought to abuse the flesh.
And those that have followed his heresy, imitat.
ing blindly and foolishly that which was done
and said, commit fornication without shame.
But I understand that Nicolaus had to do
with no other woman than her to whom he was
married, and that, so far as his children are con
cerned, his daughters continued in a state of virgin
ity until old age, and his son remained uncorrupt.
If this is so, when he brought his wife, whom
he jealously loved, into the midst of the apos
tles, he was evidently renouncing his passion;
and when he used the expression, "to abuse the
flesh," he was inculcating self-control in the face
of those pleasures that are eagerly pursued. For
I suppose that, in accordance with the command
of the Saviour, he did not wish to serve two

say that Matthias also taught in the same
manner that we ought to fight against and abuse
the flesh, and not give way to it for the sake of
pleasure, but strengthen the soul by faith and
knowledge." So much concerning those who
then attempted to pervert the truth, but in less
time than it has taken to tell it became entirely
extinct.

wickedness.
Whether the sect really claimed Nicolas as their
founder, or whether the combination was made by Irenaeus in con
sequence of the identity of his name with the name of a sect men
tioned in the Apocalypse, we cannot tell: nor have we any idea, in
the latter case, where the sect got the name which they bore. Clem
ent of Alexandria, in the passage quoted just below, gives us quite
a different account of the character of Nicolas; and as he is a more
reliable writer than the ones above quoted, and as his statement ex
plains excellently the appeal of the sect to Nicolas' authority, with
out impeaching his character, which certainly his go among
the Seven would lead us to expect was good, and good enough
to warrant permanence, we feel safe in o: his account as the
true one, and denying that Nicolas himself bore the character which
marked the sect o: Nicolaitans; though the latter may, as Clem;
ent says, have arisen from abusing a saying of Nicolas which had
been uttered with a good motive.

and Philip also gave his daughters in marriage.
And Paul does not hesitate, in one of his epistles,
to greet his wife," whom he did not take about
with him, that he might not be inconven
ienced in his ministry." And since we have
mentioned this subject it is not improper to
subjoin another account which is given by the
same author and which is worth reading. In the
seventh book of his Stromata he writes as fol
lows:" "They say, accordingly, that when the
blessed Peter saw his own wife led out to die, he
rejoiced because of her summons and her return
home, and called to her very encouragingly and
comfortingly, addressing her by name, and say
ing, "Oh thou, remember the Lord."
Such was
the marriage of the blessed, and their perfect
disposition toward those dearest to them." This
account being in keeping with the subject in
hand, I have related here in its proper place.

The Death of John and Philip.

Paul and Peter as well as their burial places,

In it Clement had referred
just above and the one which follows.
to two classes of heretics, - without giving their names, - one of
which encouraged all sorts of license, while the other taught celibacy.
Having in that place refuted the former class, he devotes the chapter
from which the following quotation is taken to a refutation of the
latter, deducing against them the fact that some of the apostles were
married.
Clement, here, as in his Quis dives sa/octur (quoted in
chap. 23), shows his good common sense which led him to avoid the
extreme of asceticism as well as that of license. He was in this
an exception to most of the Fathers of his own and subsequent ages,
who in their reaction from the licentiousness of the times advised
and often encouraged by their own example the most rigid asceti.
cism, and thus laid the foundation for monasticism.

* Strom. III. 6.
* Peter was married, as we know from Matt. viii. 14 (cf.

1 Cor.
ix. 5). Tradition also tells us of a daughter, St. Petronilla. She is
first called St. Peter's daughter in the Apocryphal Acts of SS.
A'ereus and Achilles, which give a legendary account of her life
and death.
In the Christian cemetery of Flavia Domitilla was
buried an Aurelia Petronilla filia dulcissima, and Petronilla
being taken as a diminutive of Petrus, she was assumed to have been
a daughter of Peter. ... It is probable that this was the origin of the
popular tradition.
Petronilla is not, however, a diminutive of Pe.
trus, and it is probable that this woman was one of the Aurelian
gens and a relative of Flavia Domitilla. Compare the article Petro
nilla in the Pict. of Christ. Biog.

of the same o is the only one to tell us that they afterward
married, and he tells us nothing about their husbands.
Polycrates
in the next chapter states that two of them at least remained virgins.
Isso, Clement's statement can apply at most only to the other two.

hether his report is correct as respects them we cannot tell.
.
. The passage to which Clement here refers and which he quotes
in this connection, is 1 Qor. ix. 5; but this by no means proves that
Paul was married, and 1 Cor. vii. 8 seems to imply the opposite,
though the words might be used if he were a widower. The 'words
of Phil. iv. 3 are often quoted as addressed to his wife, but there is
no authority for such a reference.
Clement is the only Father who
reports that. Paul was married; many of them expressly deny it:
e.g., Tertullian, Hilary, Epiphanius, Jerome, &c. The authority
of these later Fathers is of course of little account.
But Clement's
conclusion is based solely upon exegetical grounds, and therefore is
no argument for the truth of the report.

In this epistle he mentions him to

Philip and his
daughters in the following words: ""For in
Asia also great lights have fallen asleep, which
shall rise again on the last day, at the coming
of the Lord, when he shall come with glory from
heaven and shall seek out all the saints. Among
these are Philip, one of the twelve apostles," who
sleeps in Hierapolis, and his two aged virgin
daughters, and another daughter who lived in
the Holy Spirit and now rests at Ephesus;* and

epistle, is quoted below in Bk. V. chap. 24.
From that chapter we
see that the epistle was written in connection with the Quarto-deci
man controversy, and after saying, "We therefore observe the genu
ine day," Polycrates goes on in the words quoted here to mention
the "great lights of Asia" as confirming his own practice.
(See
the notes upon the epistle in Bk. V. chap. 24.) The citation here of
this incidental passage from a letter upon a wholly different subject
illustrates Eusebius' great diligence in searching out all historical
notices which could in any way contribute to his history.
" Philip the apostle and #. the evangelist are here con
founded. That they were really two different men is clear enough
from Luke's account in the Acts (cf. Acts vi. 2-5, viii. 14-17, and
xxi. 8). That it was the evangelist, and not the apostle, that was
buried in Hierapolis may be assumed upon the following grounds:
(1) The evangelist (according to Acts xxi. 8) had four daughters,
who were virgins and prophetesses.
Polycrates speaks here of three
daughters, at least two of whom were virgins, and Proclus, just be
low, speaks of four daughters who were prophetesses.

correct, and that it was the apostle, not the evangelist, that was
buried in, Hierapolis; but the reasons which he gives are trivial and
will hardly convince scholars in general.
Certainly we need strong
grounds to justify the separation of two men so remarkably similar
so far as their families are concerned.
But the truth is, there is
nothing more natural than that later generations should identify the
evangelist with the apostle of the same name, and should assume
the presence of the latter wherever the former was known to have
been.
This identification would in itself be a welcome one to the
inhabitants of Hierapolis, and hence it would be assumed there more
readily than anywhere else. Of course it is not impossible that
Philip the apostle also had daughters who were virgins and proph
etesses, but it is far more o: that Polycrates (and o
Clement too; see the previous chapter) confounded him with the
evangelist, - as every one may have done for some generations be

difficulty in making the identification, and certainly it was just as
easy for Polycrates and Clement to do the same.
Lightfoot makes
something of the fact that Polycrates mentions only three daugh
ters, instead of four.
Hut the latter's words by no means imply
that there had not been a fourth daughter (see note 8, below). .

* Hierapolis was a prominent city in Proconsular Asia, about
five miles north of Laodicea, in connection with which city it is men
tioned in Col. iv. 13. The ruins of this city are quite extensive, and
its site is occupied by a village called Pambouk Kelessi.
* The fact that only three of Philip's daughters are mentioned
here, when from the Acts we know he had four, shows that the fourth
had died elsewhere; and therefore it would have been aside from
Polycrates' purpose to mention her, since, as we see from Bk. V.
chap. 24, he was citing only those who had lived in Asia (the prov
ince), and had agreed as to the date of the Passover. The separate
mention of this third daughter by Polycrates has been supposed to
arise from the fact that she was married, while the other two re
mained virgins.
This is, however, not at all implied, as the fact
that she was buried in a different place would be enough to cause
the separate mention of her. §1. inasmuch as Clement (see the
preceding chapter) reports that Philip's daughters were married, and
inasmuch as Polycrates expressly states that two of them were vir
gins, it is quite possible that she (as well as the fourth daughter, not
mentioned here) may have been a married woman, which would,
perhaps, account for her living in Ephesus and being buried there,

much concerning their death. And in the

Philip and his daughters: "After him " there

Valesius and others have thought that John
and James, and perhaps others of the apostles, actually wore
something resembling the diadem of the high priest; but this is not
at all probable. The words are either to be taken in a purely figu
rative sense, as meaning that John bore the character of a priest, -
i.e. the high priest of Christ as his most beloved disciple, - or, as
Hesele suggests, the report is to be regarded as a mythical tradition
which arose after the second Jewish war. See Kraus' Real-Ency

at Ephesus, while Proclus puts them all four at Hierapolis. But the
report of Polycrates deserves our credence rather than that of Pro
clus, because, in the first place, Polycrates was earlier than Proclus:
in the second place, his report is more exact, and it is hard to imag
ine how, if all four were really buried in one place, the more detailed
report of Polycrates could have arisen, while on the other hand it is
quite easy to explain the rise of the more general but inexact ac
count of Proclus; for with the general tradition that Philip and his
daughters lived and died in Hierapolis needed only to be combined
the fact that he had four daughters, and Proclus' version was com

How É. could have overlooked the contradiction it is more
difficult to explain. He can hardly have failed to notice it, but was
undoubtedly unable to account for the difference, and probably con
sidered it too small a matter to concern himself about. He was quite
prone to accept earlier accounts just as they stood, whether contra
3.3, or not. The fact that they had been recorded was usually
enough for him, if they contained no improbable or fabulous stories.
He cannot be accused of intentional deception at this point, for he
ives the true accounts side by side, so that every reader might
judge of the agreement for himself. Upon the confusion of the
apostle and evangelist, see above, note 6.

We have thus set forth in these pages
what has come to our knowledge concern
ing the apostles themselves and the apostolic
age, and concerning the sacred writings which
they have left us, as well as concerning those
which are disputed, but nevertheless have been
publicly used by many in a great number of
churches," and moreover, concerning those that
are altogether rejected and are out of harmony
with apostolic orthodoxy. Having done this, let
us now proceed with our history.

CHAPTER XXXII.

Symeon, Bishop of Jerusalem, suffers Mar
tyrdom.

It is reported that after the age of Nero and
Domitian, under the emperor whose times
we are now recording,' a persecution was stirred
up against us in certain cities in consequence of
a popular uprising." In this persecution we have
understood that Symeon, the son of Clopas,
who, as we have shown, was the second bishop
of the church of Jerusalem," suffered martyr
Hegesippus, whose words we have

already quoted in various places," is a witness
to this fact also. Speaking of certain heretics" he
adds that Symeon was accused by them at this
time ; and since it was clear that he was a Chris
tian, he was tortured in various ways for many days,
and astonished even the judge himself and his
attendants in the highest degree, and finally he
suffered a death similar to that of our Lord."
But there is nothing like hearing the historian himself, who writes as follows: "Cer
tain of these heretics brought accusation against
Symeon, the son of Clopas, on the ground that he
was a descendant of David' and a Christian ;

And the same writer says that his accus
ers also, when search was made for the
descendants of David, were arrested as belong
ing to that family." And it might be reasonably
assumed that Symeon was one of those that saw
and heard the Lord," judging from the length of
his life, and from the fact that the Gospel makes
mention of Mary, the wife of Clopas," who was
the father of Symeon, as has been already
shown." The same historian says that there
were also others, descended from one of
the so-called brothers of the Saviour, whose
name was Judas, who, after they had borne tes
timony before Domitian, as has been already
recorded," in behalf of faith in Christ, lived
until the same reign. He writes as follows:
"They came, therefore, and took the lead

This was quite natural, after the attention of the govern
ment had been officially drawn to the family by the arrest of Symeon.

has been commonly ascribed (together with the martyrdom of Igna
tius) to the year 106 or 107, upon the authority of Eusebius' Chron.,
which is supposed to connect these events with the ninth or tenth
year of Trajan's reign.
But an examination of the passage in the
Chron., where Eusebius groups together these two events and the
persecutions in Bithynia, shows that he did not pretend to know the
exact date of any of them, and simply put them together as three
similar events known to have occurred during the reign of Trajan
(cf. Lightfoot's Ignatius, //, p. 447 sqq.). The year of Atticus'
roconsulship we unfortunately do not show, although Wieseler, in
is Christen-l'er/oloungen der Caesarest, p. 126, cites Wadding
ton as his authority for the statement that Herodes Atticus was pro
consul of Palestine from 105 to 107; but all that Waddington says
(Fastes des Aroz'. A stat., p. 720) is, that since the proconsul sor
the years to 5 to 107 is not known, and Eusebius puts the death of
Symeon in the ninth or tenth year of Trajan, we may assume that
this was the date of Atticus' proconsulship. This, of course, sur
nishes no support for the common opinion.
Lightfoot, on account
of the fact that Symeon was the son of Clopas, wishes to put the
martyrdom earlier in Trajan's reign, and it is probable that it oc
curred earlier rather than later; more cannot
said. The great
age of Symeon and his martyrdom under Trajan are too well authen
ticated to admit of doubt; at the same time, the figure 12o may well
be an exaggeration, as Lightfoot thinks, Renan (Les Era igies,
É. 466) considers it very improbable that Symeon could have had so
ong a life and episcopate, and therefore invents a second Symeon, a
o of Clopas, as fourth bishop of Jerusalem, and makes

there is no warrant for rejecting the tradition, which is unanimous
in calling Symeon the son of Clopas, and also in emphasizing his
great age.

It "came to be used in the second century espe

later date of such governors even though they might not have been
consuls" (Lightfoot, p. 59, who refers to Marquardt, Römische
Staatsverwaltung, I. 409).

" This is a peculiar statement. Members of the house of David
would hardly have ventured to accuse Symeon on the ground that he
belonged to that house. The statement is, however, quite indefinite.
We are not told what happened to these accusers, nor indeed that
they really were of David's line, although the waráv with which Eu
sebius introduces the charge does not imply any doubt in his own
mind, aso quite rightly remarks.
It is possible that some
who were of the line of David may have accused Symeon, not of be
ing a member of that family, but only of being a Christian, and that
the report of the occurrence may have become afterward confused.

in every church, they remained until the reign of
the Emperor Trajan," and until the above-men
tioned Symeon, son of Clopas, an uncle of the
Lord, was informed against by the heretics, and
was himself in like manner accused for the same
cause" before the governor Atticus." And after
being tortured for many days he suffered mar
tyrdom, and all, including even the proconsul,
marveled that, at the age of one hundred and
twenty years, he could endure so much. And
orders were given that he should be cruci
fied." In addition to these things the same
man, while recounting the events of that
period, records that the Church up to that time
had remained a pure and uncorrupted virgin,
since, if there were any that attempted to cor
rupt the sound norm of the preaching of salva
tion, they lay until then concealed in obscure
darkness.
But when the sacred college of
apostles had suffered death in various forms,
and the generation of those that had been deemed
worthy to hear the inspired wisdom with their
own ears had passed away, then the league of
godless error took its rise as a result of the folly
of heretical teachers," who, because none of the
apostles was still living, attempted henceforth,
with a bold face, to proclaim, in opposition to
the preaching of the truth, the ‘knowledge which
is falsely so-called."

So great a persecution was at that time

1 Plinius Caecilius Secundus, commonly called "Pliny the young
er" to distinguish him from his uncle, Plinius Secundus the elder,
was a man of great literary attainments and an intimate friend of
the Emperor Trajan. Of his literary remains the most important
are his epistles, collected in ten books. The epistle of which Euse
bius speaks in this chapter is No. 96 (97), and the reply of Trajan No.
97 (98) of the tenth book. The epistle was written from Bithynia,
probably within a year after Pliny became governor there, which

therefore I am ignorant how and to what extent it

to punish or to search for them. And I have hesitated greatly as
to whether any distinction should be made on the ground of age,
or whether the weak should be treated in the same way as the
strong; whether pardon should be granted to the penitent, or he who
has ever been a Christian gain nothing by renouncing it; whether
the mere name, if unaccompanied with crimes, or crimes associated
with the name, should be punished.
Meanwhile, with those who

they have confessed, I have asked them a second and third time,

Moreover, they affirmed that this was the sum of

is not the characteristic of a nefarious superstition); but this they

I had prohibited fraternities. I therefore considered it the more
necessary to examine, even with the use of torture, two female slaves
who were called deaconesses (ministrae), in order to ascertain the
truth.

made the following decree: that the race of
Christians should not be sought after, but when
found should be punished. On account of this
the persecution which had threatened to be a
most terrible one was to a certain degree
checked, but there were still left plenty of pre
texts for those who wished to do us harm.
Sometimes the people, sometimes the rulers in
various places, would lay plots against us, so
that, although no great persecutions took place,
local persecutions were nevertheless going on
in particular provinces," and many of the faith
ful endured martyrdom in various forms.
We have taken
our account from the
Latin Apology of Tertullian which we men
tioned above." The translation runs as follows:*
"And indeed we have found that search for us
has been forbidden." For when Plinius Secundus,
the governor of a province, had condemned cer
tain Christians and deprived them of their dig
nity, he was confounded by the multitude, and
was uncertain what further course to pursue. He
therefore communicated with Trajan the empe
ror, informing him that, aside from their unwil

piety in them. And he reported this also,

But this interpretation is a decided mistake.

* The view which Tertullian here takes of Trajan's rescript is
that it was, on the whole, favorable, - that the Christians stood after
it in a better state in relation to the law than before, - and this in
terpretation of the edict was adopted by all the early Fathers, and is,
as we can see, accepted likewise by Eusebius (and so he entitles this
chapter, not "Trajan commands the Christians to be punished, if
they persist in their Christianity," but "Trajan forbids the Chris.
tians to be sought after," thus implying that the rescript is favora
ble).
Trajan's re
script expressly made Christianity a religio officita, and from that
time on it was a crime in the sight of the law to be a Christian;
whereas, before that time, the matter had not been finally deter
mined, and it had been left for each ruler to act just as he pleased.
Trajan, it is true, advises moderation in the execution of the law;
but that does not alter the fact that his rescript is an unsavorable
one, which makes the profession of Christianity - what it had not
been before - a direct violation of an oed law. Compare.

gree of accuracy. A notice in the Chron. Paschałe, which makes
him a martyr and connects his death with that of Polycarp, assign
ing both to the year 164 A.D., has been shown by Lightfoot (Con
tems. Rezniew, 1875, II. p. 381) to rest upon a confusion of names,
and to be, therefore, entirely untrustworthy. We learn, however,
from chap. 39, below, that Papias was acquainted with personal sol
lowers of the Lord (e.g. with Aristion and the "presbyter John "),
and also with the daughters of Philip. He must, therefore, have
reached years of maturity before the end of the first century. On
the other hand, the five books of his A.rpositions cannot have been
written very long before the middle of the second century, for some
of the extant fragments seem to show traces of the existence of Gnos
ticism in a somewhat advanced form at the time he wrote. With
these data we shall not be sar wrong in saying that he was born
in the neighborhood of 70 A.D., and died before the middle of the
second century. He was a pronounced chiliast, (see chap. 39, note
& and according to Eusebius, a man of limited understanding (see
chap. 39, note 29); but the claim of the Tübingen school that he
was an Ebionite is not supported by extant evidence (see Lightsoot,
food. p. 384). On the writings of Papias, see below, chap. 39,
note I.

* Four MSS. insert at this point the words &viip rā Tévra ort
wd Atara Aoyotoratos kai Toms Ypaons eiðmu.gov ("a man of the great
arc ...; by Heinichen, Closs, and Cruse. The large majority of
est learning in all lines and well versed in the Scriptures"), which
the best MSS., however, supported by Rufinus, and followed by
Walesius (in his notes), Stroth, Laemmer, Burton, and the German
translator, Stigloher, omit the words, which are undoubtedly to be
regarded as an interpolation, intended perhaps to offset the deroga
tory words used by Eusebius in respect to Papias, in chap. 39, § 13.
In discussing the genuineness of these words, critics, (among them
Heinichen) have concerned themselves too much with the question
whether, the opinion of Papias expressed here contradicts that cy
pressed in chap. 39, and therefore, whether Eusebius can have writ
ten these words.
Even if it be possible to reconcile the two passages
and to show that Papias may have been a learned man, while at the
same time he was of "limited judgment," as Eusebius informs us,
the fact nevertheless remains that the weight of MS. authority is
heavily against the genuineness of the words, and that it is much
easier to understand the interpolation than the omission of such an
expression in praise of one of the apostolic Fathers, especially when
the lack of any commendation here and in chap. 39 must be un
pleasantly noticeable.

*. Eusebius follows what was undoubtedly the oldest tradition in
making Evodius the first bishop of Antioch, and Ignatius the second
(see above, chap. 22, note 2).

below), the fact that Ignatius was bishop ..}". church of Antioch
in Syria is established by FA. at Rom. 5, compared with at Smy.

If the genuineness of the epistles be denied,
these passages seem to prove at least his connection with the church
of Antioch and his influential position in it, for otherwise the forgery
of the epistles under his name would be inconceivable.

There are few more prominent figures in carly Church history
than Ignatius, and yet there are few about whom we have less un
questioned knowledge. He is known in history pre-eminently as a
martyr. The greater part of his life is buried in complete obscurity.
It is only as a man condemned to death for his profession of Christi.
anity that he comes out into the light, and it is with him in this char
acter and with the martyrdom which followed that tradition has
busied itself. There are extant various Acts of the Martyrdom ot
St. Ignatius, which contain detailed accounts of his death, but those
belong to the fourth and subsequent centuries, are quite contra
dictory in their statements, and have been conclusiv !. proved to
be utterly unreliable and to furnish no trustworthy information on
the subject in hand.
From writers before Eusebius we have but
four notices of Ignatius (Polycarp's AA. ad // is, 9, 13; Irenaeus'
<!?". Her. V. 28. 3, quoted below; Origen, Prof. in Cant., and
Hon. I./. on J. oc.).
These surnish us with very little informa
tion.
If the notice in Polycarp's epistle be genuine (and though it
has been widely attacked, there is no good reason to doubt it), it
surnishes us with our earliest testimony to the martyrdom of a cer.
tain Ignatius and to the existence of cpistles written by him. Ire
naeus does not name Ignatius, but he testifies to the existence of
the Epistle to the Romans which bears his name, and to the martyr
dom of the author of that epistle.
Origen informs us that Ignatius,
the author of certain epistles, was second bishop of the church of
Antioch and suffered martyrdom at Rome. Eusebius, in the present
chapter, is the first one to give us an extended account of Ignatius,
and his account contains no information beyond what he might have
drawn from the Ignatian epistles themselves as they lay before him,
except the statements, already made by Origen, o jo, was
the second bishop of A. and suffered martyrdom at Rome.
The former statement must have rested on a tradition, at least in
part; independent of the epistles (for they imply only the fact of
his Antiochian episcopacy, without specifying the time); the latter
might have arisen from the cpistles themselves (in which it is clearly
stated that the writer is on his way to Rome to suffer martyrdom),

III. 36.)

IGNATIUS AND HIS EPISTLES.

Report says that he was sent from Syria to
Rome, and became food for wild beasts on

for of course it would be natural to assume that his expectation was
realized.

The connection in which Eusebius records the martyrdom im
plies that he believed that it took place in the reign of Trajan, and
in his Chronicle he gives precise dates for the beginning of his
episcopate (the 212th Olympiad, i.e. 69-72 A.D.) and for his martyr
dom (the tenth year of Trajan, i.e. 107 A.D.).
Subsequent notices
of Ignatius are either quite worthless or are based solely upon the
epistles themselves or upon the statements of Eusebius. The in
formation, independent of the epistles, which has reached us from
the time of Eusebius or earlier, consequently narrows itself down to
the report that Ignatius was second bishop of Antioch, and that he
was bishop from about 70 to 107 A.D. The former date may be
regarded as entirely unreliable.
Even were it granted that there
could have been a bishop at the head of the Antiochian church at so
early a date (and there is no warrant for such a supposition), it would
nevertheless be impossible to place any reliance upon the date given
by Eusebius, as it is impossible to place any reliance upon the dates
given for the so-called bishops of other cities during the first century
(see Bk. IV. chap. 1, note 1).
But the date of Ignatius' martyrdom
given by Eusebius seems at first sight to rest upon a more reliable
tradition, and has been accepted by many scholars as correct.
Its
accuracy, however, has been impugned, especially by Zahn and
Lightfoot, who leave the date of Ignatius' death uncertain, claiming
simply that he died under Trajan; and by Harnack, who puts his
death into the reign of Hadrian. We jīrī. to this again further
on. Meanwhile, since the information which we have of Ignatius,
independent of the Ignatian epistles, is so small in amount, we are
obliged to turn to those epistles for our chief knowledge of his life
and character.

But at this point a difficulty confronts us. There are extant three
different recensions of epistles ascribed to Ignatius. Are any of
them genuine, and if so, which * The first, or longer Greek recen
sion, as it is called, consists of fifteen epistles, which were first pub
lished in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Of these fifteen, eight
are clearly spurious, and seven are at least largely interpolated. The
enuineness of the former and the integrity of the latter now find no
efenders among scholars. The second, or shorter Greek recension,
contains seven of the fifteen epistles of the longer recension, in a
much shorter form. Their titles are the same that are given by
Eusebius in this chapter. They were first discovered and published
in the seventeenth century. The third, or Syriac recension, con
tains three of these seven epistles (to Polycarp, to the Ephesians,
and to the Romans), in a still shorter form, and was discovered in
the present century. Since its discovery, opinions have been divided
between it and the shorter Greek recension; but the defense of the
enuineness of the latter by Zahn and Lightfoot may be regarded as
i. settling the matter, and establishing the originality of the
shorter Greek recension as over against that represented by the
Syriac version. The former, therefore, alone comes into considera
tion in discussing the genuineness of the o epistles.
Their
enuineness is still stoutly denied by some; but the evidence in their
#. external and internal, is too strong to be set aside; and since
the appearance of Lightfoot's great work, candid scholars almost
unanimously admit that the question is settled, and their genuine
ness triumphantly established. The great difficulties which have
stood in the way of the acceptance of the epistles are, first and chiefly,
the highly developed form of church government which they reveal;
and secondly, the attacks upon heresy contained in them.
Both of
these characteristics seem to necessitate a date later than the reign of
Trajan, the traditional time of Ignatius' martyrdom. Harnack regards
these two difficulties as very serious, if not absolutely fatal to the
supposition that the epistles were written during the reign of Trajan;
but in a very keen tract, entitled Die Zeit does /g natius (Leipzig,
1878), he has endeavored to show that the common tradition that
Ignatius suffered martyrdom under Trajan is worthless, and he
therefore brings the martyrdom down into the reign of Hadrian, and
thus does away with most of the internal difficulties which beset the
acceptance of the epistles. Whether or not Harnack's explanation
of Eusebius' chronology of the Antiochian bishops be accepted as
correct (and the number of its adherents is not great), he has, at
least, shown that the tradition that Ignatius suffered martyrdom un
der Trajan is not as strong as it has been commonly supposed to be,

foot, who discusses Harnack's theory at considerable length (II.
p. 450-469), rejects it, and maintains that Ignatius died sometime
during the reign of Trajan, though, with Zahn and Harnack, he gives
up the traditional date of 107 A.D., which is found in the Chronic/e of
Eusebius, and has been very commonly accepted as reliable. Light
foot, however, remarks that the genuineness of the epistles is much
more certain than the chronology of Ignatius, and that, therefore, if
it is a question between the rejection of the epistles and the relega
tion of Ignatius' death to the reign of Hadrian (which he, however,
denies), the latter alternative must be chosen without hesitation. A
final decision upon this knotty point has not yet been, and perhaps
never will be, reached; but Harnack's theory that the epistles were
written during the reign of Hadrian deserves even more careful con
sideration than it has yet received.

Granting the genuineness of the Ignatian epistles, we are still
in possession of no great amount of information in regard to his life.
We know from them only that he was bishop of the church of Anti
och in Syria, and had been condemned to martyrdom, and that he

account of his testimony to Christ." And
as he made the journey through Asia under
the strictest military surveillance, he fortified the
parishes in the various cities where he stopped
by oral homilies and exhortations, and warned
them above all to be especially on their guard
against the heresies that were then beginning to
prevail, and exhorted them to hold fast to the
tradition of the apostles.
Moreover, he thought
it necessary to attest that tradition in writing,
and to give it a fixed form for the sake of
greater security.
So when he came to
Smyrna, where Polycarp was, he wrote an
epistle to the church of Ephesus," in which he

was, at the time of their composition, on his way to Rome to suffer
death in the arena. His character and opinions, however, are very
clearly exhibited in his writings. To quote from Schaff, "Ignatius
stands out in history as the ideal of a Catholic martyr, and as the
earliest advocate of the hierarchical principle in both its good and
its evil points. As a writer, he is ... for originality, fresh
ness, and force of ideas, and for terse, sparkling, and sententious
style; but in apostolic simplicity and soundness, he is inferior to
Clement and Polycarp, and presents a stronger contrast to the epis
tles of the New Testament. Clement shows the calmness, dignity,
and governmental wisdom of the Roman character.
Ignatius glows
with the fire and impetuosity of the Greek and Syrian temper which
carries him beyond the bounds of sobriety. He was a very uncom
mon man, and made a powerful impression upon his age. He is the
incarnation, as it were, of the three closely connected ideas: the
glory of martyrdom, the omnipotence of episcopacy, and the hatred
of heresy and schism.
Hierarchical pride and humility, Christian
charity and churchly exclusiveness, are typically represented in
Ignatius."

extensive. The principal editions to be consulted are Cureton's

tory, Vol. II. p. 651-664.
demnation for his testimony to Christ, and that he was expecting to
be cast to the wild beasts upon reaching Rome, appears from many
passages of the epistles themselves. Whether the tradition, as Fu
sebius calls it, that he actually did suffer martyrdom at Rome was
independent of the epistles, or simply grew out of the statements
made in them, we cannot tell. W.. is the case, we may re
gard the tradition as reliable.
That he suffered martyrdom some
where is too well attested to be doubted for a moment; and there
exists no tradition in favor of any other city as the place of his
martyrdom, except a late one reported by John Malalas, which names
Antioch as the place.
This is accepted by Volkmar, and by the
author of Supernatural Religion, but its falsity has been conclu
sively shown by Zahn (see his edition of the Ignatian epistles, p.
x11, o 381).
"The seven genuine epistles of Ignatius (all of which are men
tioned by Eusebius in this chapter) fall into two groups, four having
been written from one place and three from another. The first four
- to the Ephesians, J/agnesians, Tra//fans, and Romans - were
written from Smyrna, while Ignatius was on his way to Rome, as
we can learn from notices in the epistles themselves, and as is stated
below by Eusebius, who probably took his information from the
statements of the epistles, as we take ours.
Ephesus, Magnesia,
and Tralles lay to the south of Smyrna, on one of the great highways
of Asia Minor. But Ignatius was taken by a road which lay further
north, passing through Philadelphia and Sardis (see Lightfoot, I. 33
sq.), and thus did not visit the three cities to which he now sends
epistles from Smyrna. The four epistles written from Smyrna con

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[III. 36.

mentions Onesimus, its pastor;' and another to
the church of Magnesia, situated upon the Mae
ander, in which he makes mention again of a
bishop Damas; and finally one to the church of
Tralles, whose bishop, he states, was at that
time Polybius.
In addition to these he wrote
also to the church of Rome, entreating
them not to secure his release from martyrdom,
and thus rob him of his earnest hope.
In con
firmation of what has been said it is proper to
quote briefly from this epistle. He writes
as follows: ""From Syria even unto Rome
I fight with wild beasts, by land and by sea,
by night and by day, being bound amidst ten
leopards," that is, a company of soldiers who
only become worse when they are well treated.
In the midst of their wrongdoings, however, I
am more fully learning discipleship, but I
am not thereby justified." May I have joy
of the beasts that are prepared for me; and
I pray that I may find them ready; I will even
coax them to devour me quickly that they may
not treat me as they have some whom they have
refused to touch through fear." And if they are
Forgive me.
unwilling, I will compel them.
I know what is expedient for me. Now do I
begin to be a disciple. May naught of things
visible and things invisible envy me; * that I may
attain unto Jesus Christ.
Let fire and cross and
attacks of wild beasts, let wrenching of bones,
cutting of limbs, crushing of the whole body,
tortures of the devil, -let all these come upon
me if only I may attain unto Jesus Christ."
These things he wrote from the above
mentioned city to the churches referred to.
And when he had left Smyrna he wrote again
from Troas" to the Philadelphians and to the
church of Smyrna; and particularly to Polycarp,
who presided over the latter church. And since
he knew him well as an apostolic man, he com
mended to him, like a true and good shepherd,
the flock at Antioch, and besought him to care

tain no indication of the chronological order in which they were
written, and whether Eusebius in his enumeration followed the
manuscript of the epistles which he used (our present MSS. give an
entirely different order, which is not at all chronological and does
not even keep the two groups distinct), or whether he exercised his
own judgment, we do not know.

* Of this Onesimus, and of Damas and Polybius mentioned just

below, we know nothing more.

* Ignatius, E.A. at Row. chap. 5.

This is the earliest use of this word in any extant
writing, and an argument has been drawn from this fact against the
authenticity of the epistle.
For a careful discussion of the matter,
see Lightfoot's edition, Vol. II. p. 212.

* Compare I Cor. iv. 4.

* The translation of this sentence is Lightfoot's, who prefers
with Rufinus and the Syriac to read the optative on Aora instead of
the infinitive Smasorat, which is found in most of the MSS. and is
given by Heinichen and the majority of the other editors. The
sense seems to require, as Lightfoot asserts, the optative rather than
the infinitive.

* That Troas was the place from which Ignatius wrote to the
Philadelphians, to the Smyrnaeans, and to Polycarp is clear from
indications in the cpistles themselves. The chronological order in
which the three were written is uncertain. He had visited both
churches upon his journey to Troas and had seen Polycarp in
Smyrna.

Ire
naeus also knew of his martyrdom and men
tions his epistles in the following words:" "As
one of our people said, when he was condemned
to the beasts on account of his testimony unto
God, I am God's wheat, and by the teeth of wild
beasts am I ground, that I may be found
pure bread." Polycarp also mentions these
letters in the
epistle to the Philippians
which is ascribed to him."
His words are as
follows: " "I exhort all of you, therefore, to be
obedient and to practice all patience such as ye
saw with your own eyes not only in the blessed
Ignatius and Rufus and Zosimus," but also in
others from among yourselves as well as in Paul
himself and the rest of the apostles; being per
suaded that all these ran not in vain, but in faith
and righteousness, and that they are gone to their
rightful place beside the Lord, with whom also
they suffered.
For they loved not the present
world, but him that died for our sakes and
was raised by God for us." And afterwards
he adds:* "You have written to me, both
you and Ignatius, that if any one go to Syria he
may carry with him the letters from you. And
this I will do if I have a suitable opportunity,
either I myself or one whom I send to be

Ignatius in his %. voir. ii. 16, refers it to the gospel which had
lately been translated by him (according to de var. o. 3), viz.: the
Gospel of the Vaza renes (or the ... s. according to the He
&rews).
In his Comment. in Isaiam, Bk. XVIII. introd., Jerome
quotes the same passage again, referring it to the same gospel
(AEvange/run owed //cérarora, on sectitant Vazaraei). 1. in

Teach ong of Peter ("out yo, d'o c t r i ml a apellator").
Eusebius' various references to the Gospel
according to the He
brews show that he was personally acquainted with it (see above,
chap. 25, note 24), and knowing his great thoroughness in going
through the books which he had access to, it is impossible to sup
pose that if this passage quoted from Ignatius were in the Gos
pel according to the Hebrews he should not have known it. We
seem then to be driven to the conclusion that the passage did not
originally stand in the Gospel according to the Hebrews, but was
later incorporated either from the Traching of Peter, in which
Origen found it, or from some common source or oral tradition.

AMONG those that were celebrated at that
time was Quadratus,' who, report says, was
renowned along with the daughters of Philip for
his prophetical gifts.
And there were many
others besides these who were known in those
days, and who occupied the first place among
the successors of the apostles. And they also,
being illustrious disciples of such great men,
built up the foundations of the churches which
had been laid by the apostles in every place, and
preached the Gospel more and more widely and
scattered the saving seeds of the kingdom of
heaven far and near throughout the whole
world." For indeed most of the disciples of
that time, animated by the divine word with
a more ardent love for philosophy," had already
fulfilled the command of the Saviour, and had
distributed their goods to the needy." Then
starting out upon long journeys they performed
the office of evangelists, being filled with the
desire to preach Christ to those who had not yet
heard the word of faith, and to deliver to
them the divine Gospels. And when they
had only laid the foundations of the faith in
foreign places, they appointed others as pastors,
and entrusted them with the nurture of those
that had recently been brought in, while they
themselves went on again to other countries and
nations, with the grace and the co-operation of

done through them by the power of the divine
Spirit, so that at the first hearing whole multi
tudes of men eagerly embraced the religion
of the Creator of the universe.
But since
it is impossible for us to enumerate the
names of all that became shepherds or evange
lists in the churches throughout the world in the
age immediately succeeding the apostles, we
have recorded, as was fitting, the names of
those only who have transmitted the apostolic
doctrine to us in writings still extant.

The Epistle of Clement and the IWritings false/y
ascribed to him.

many thoughts drawn from the Epistle to the
Hebrews, and also quotes verbally some of its
expressions, thus showing most plainly that
it is not a recent production.
Wherefore it
has seemed reasonable to reckon it with the
other writings of the apostle.
For as Paul had
written to the Hebrews in his native tongue, some
say that the evangelist Luke, others that this
Clement himself, translated the epistle. The
latter seems more probable, because the
epistle of Clement and that to the Hebrews have
a similar character in regard to style, and still
further because the thoughts contained in the
two works are not very different."

* Eusebius is the first one to mention the ascription of a second
epistle to Clement, but after the fifth century such an epistle (whether
the one to which Eusebius here refers we cannot tell) was in com
mon circulation and was quite widely accepted as genuine.
This
epistle is still extant, in a mutilated form in the Alexandrian M.S.,
complete in the MS. discovered by Bryennios in Constantinople in
1875. The publication of the complete work proves, what had long
been suspected, that it is not an epistle at all, but a homily.
It can
not have been written by the author of the first epistle of Clement,
nor can it belong to the first century.
It was probably written in
Rome about the middle of the second century (see Harnock's articles
in the Zeitschrift /ür Kirchengeschichto, Vol. I. p. 264-283 and
329-364), and is the oldest extant homily, and as such possesses con
siderable interest.
It has always gone by the name of the Second
Epistle of Clement, and hence continues to be so called although the
title is a misnomer, for neither is it an epistle, nor is it by Clement.
It is published in all the editions of the apostolic Fathers, but only
those editions that have appeared since the discovery of the com
plete homily by Bryennios are now of value. Of these, it is neces
sary to mention only Gebhardt, Harnack, and Zahn's Patrum:
Apost. Opera, 2d ed., 1876, in which Harnack's prolegomena and
nótes are especially valuable, and the appendix to Lightfoot's edi

But no mention
has been made of these by the ancients; for
they do not even preserve the pure stamp of
apostolic orthodoxy. The acknowledged writ

also of the works of Ignatius and Polycarp."

* There are extant a number of Pseudo-Clementine writings of
the third and following centuries, the chief among which purports
to contain a record made by Clement of discourses of the apostle
Peter, and an account of Clement's family history and of his travels
with Peter, constituting, in fact, a sort of didactico-historical ro
mance. This exists now in three forms (the Homri/ies, Recogni
tions, and Epitome), all of which are closely related; though
whether the first two (the last is simply an abridgment of the first)
are drawn from a common original, or whether one of them is the
original of the other, is not certain. The works are more or less
Ebionitic in character, and play an important part in the history of
early Christian literature.
For a careful discussion of them, see
Salmon's article Clementine Literature, in the Dirt. of Christian
Biography, and for the literature of the subject, which is very ex
tensive, see especially Schaff's Church History, II. p. 435 sq.

The fourth, fisth, and sixth books of the Homilies contain ex
tended conversations purporting to have been held between Clement
and Apion, the famous antagonist of the Jews (see Bk. II: chap. 5,
note 5). It is quite possible that the "wordy and lengthy writings, con
taining dialogues of Peter and Apion," which Eusebius refers to here
may be identical with the Homilies, in which case we must suppose
Eusebius' language to be somewhat inexact; for the dialogues in the
Asomtilies are between Clement and Apion, not between Peter and

number of works of a similar character which were in circulation
during the third and subsequent centuries, that Eusebius refers here
to another work, belonging to the same general class, which is now
lost.
If such a work existed, it may well have formed a basis for
the dialogues between Clement and Apion given in the Houst flies.
In the absence of all further evidence of such a work, we must leave
the matter quite undecided.
It is not necessary here to enumerate
the other Pseudo-Clementine works which are still extant. Compare
Schaff's Church. History, II. 648 sq. Clement's name was a favorite
one with pseudographers of the early Church, and works of all kinds
were ... under his name. }. most complete collection of
these spurious works is sound in Migne's Patr. Graec. Vols. I.
and II.

but a number of fragments of it have been preserved by Irenaeus,

edition, Vol. I. Appendix), and by Routh in his Rei. Sacrae, I. p. 316.
English translation in the Ante-Vicene Fathers (Am. ed.),
Vol. I. p. 151 sq. The exact character of the work has been long and
sharply disputed. Some contend that it was a record of oral tra
ditions in regard to the Lord which Papias had gathered, together
with a commentary o these traditions, others that it was a com
plete Gospel, others that it was a commentary upon an already ex
isting Gospel or Gospels. The last is the view which accords best
with the language of Euscbius, and it is widely accepted, though
there is controversy among those who accept it as to whether the
Gospel or Gospels which he used are to be identified with either of
our canonical Gospels.
But upon this question we cannot dwell at
this point.
Lightfoot, who believes that a written text lay at the
base of Papias' work, concludes that the work contained, first, the
text; secondly, "the interpretations which explained the text, and
which were the main object of the work"; and thirdly, the oral tra
ditions, which "were subordinate to the interpretation " (Con
temporary Review, 1875; II. p. 389). This is probably as good
a description of the plan of Papias' work as can be given, whatever
decision may be reached as to the identity of the text which he used
with any one of our Gospels.
Lightfoot has adduced strong argu
ments for his view, and has discussed at length various other views
which it is not necessary to repeat here. On the significance of the

ing words:* "These things are attested by
Papias, an ancient man who was a hearer of
John and a companion of Polycarp, in his fourth

him."
These are the words of Irenaeus.
But Papias himself in the preface to his
discourses by no means declares that he
was himself a hearer and eye-witness of the
holy apostles, but he shows by the words which
he uses that he received the doctrines of the
faith from those who were their friends."
He says: "But I shall not hesitate also to
put down for you along with my interpreta

word Aoyva, see below, note 26. As remarked there, Adyta cannot be
confined to words or discourses only, and therefore the "oracles"
which Papias expounded in his work may well have included, so far
as the title is concerned, a complete Gospel or Gospels.
In the ab
sence of the work itself, however, we are left entirely to conjecture,
though it must be remarked that in the time of Papias at least some
of our Gospels were certainly in existence and already widely ac
cepted.
It is difficult, therefore, to suppose that if written docu
ments lay at the basis of Papias' work, as we have concluded that
they did, that they can have been other than one or more of the

reserred to for a discussion of this question.
The date of the com
position of Papias' work is now commonly fixed at about the middle
of the second century, probably nearer 130 than 150 A.D. The books
and articles that have been written upon this work are far too numer
ous to mention.
Besides the article by Lightfoot in the Contezu
Aorary Rezoew, which has been already referred to, we should
mention also Salmon's article in the Dict. of Christian Biography,
Schleiermacher's essay in the Studien und Kritiken, 1832, p. 735
sq., - the first critical discussion of Papias' testimony in regard to
the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, and still valuable, - dissertations
by Weiffenbach, 1874 and 1878, and by Leimbach, 1875, with reviews
of the last two in various periodicals, notably the articles by Hilgen

that these were the only works written by Papias. He simply says,

Eusebius' interpretation of Irenaeus' words
is not, however, at all unnatural, and probably expresses Irenaeus'
meaning.

* Irenaeus, Adro. Haer. V. 33. 4.

* The justice of this criticism, passed by Eusebius upon the state
ment of Irenaeus, has been questioned by many, who have held that,
in the passage quoted just below from Papias, the same John is
meant in both cases. See the note of Schaff in his Church. History,
II. É. 697 sq. A carcful exegesis of the passage from Papias quoted
by Eusebius seems, however, to lead necessarily to the conclusion
which Eusebius draws, that Papias refers to two different persons
bearing the same name, - John.
In fact, no other conclusion can
be reached, unless we accuse Papias of the most stupid and illogical

no possible excuse for mentioning him twice in the one passage. On
the other hand, if we accept Eusebius' interpretation, we are met by
a serious difficulty in the fact that we are obliged to assume that there
lived in Asia Minor, early in the second century, a man to whom
Papias appeals as possessing exceptional authority, but who is men
tioned by no other Father; who is, in fact, otherwise an entirely un
known personage. And still further, no reader of Papias' work, be
fore the time of Eusebius, gathered from that work, so sar as we
know, a single hint that the John with whom he was acquainted was
any other than the apostle John.
These difficulties are so serious
that they have led many to deny that Papias meant to refer to a sec
ond John, in spite of his apparently clear reference to such a per
son. Among those who deny this second John's existence are such
scholars as Zahn and Salmon.

silence of all other early writers does not necessarily disprove the
existence of a second John; for it is quite conceivable that all trace
of him should be swallowed up in the reputation of his greater name
sake who lived in the same place.
Moreover, it is quite conceivable
that Papias, writing for those who were well acquainted with both
Johns, may have had no suspicion that any one would confound the
presbyter with the apostle, and would imagine that he was referrin
to the latter when he was speaking of his personal friend John; .
therefore he would have no reason for stating expressly that there
were two Johns, and for expressly distinguishing the one from the

later, knowing that Polycarp was a disciple of the apostle John, and

In view of these pos
sibilities, it cannot be said that the silence of other Fathers in regard
to this John is fatal to his existence; and if this is so, we are hardly
justified in doing such violence to Papias' language as is required, to
identify the two Johns mentioned by him in the lo." quoted be
low. Among those who accept Eusebius' conclusion, that Papias
refers to two different persons, are such scholars as Tischendorf,
Donaldson, Westcott and Lightfoot.
If Eusebius has recovered for
us from the ancient history of the Church, an otherwise unknown
personage, it will not be the only time that he has corrected an error
committed by all his predecessors.
In this case, as in a number of
other cases, I believe Eusebius' wide information, sharp-sightedness,
and superiority to the tr
vindication, and we may accept his conclusion that Papias, was per
sonally acquainted with a second John, who was familiarly known
as " §. Presbyter," and thus distinguished srom the apostle John,
who could be called a presbyter or . only in the general sense in
which all the leading men of his generation were elders (see below,
note 6), and could not be designated emphatically as "the presby
ter."
In regard to the connection of this "presbyter John "...with

uishes, as we may conclude, between two o in the passage re
erred to, and elsewhere, according to Eusebius, pronounces himself
a hearer of the second John, it does not necessarily follow that I re
naeus was mistaken in saying that he was a hearer of the apostle
John; for Irenaeus may have based his statement upon information
received from his teacher, Polycarp, the friend of Papias, and not
upon the passage quoted by Eusebius, and hence Papias may have
n a hearer of both Johns. At the same time, it must be said that
if Papias had been a disciple of the apostle John, he could scarcely
have failed to state the fact expressly somewhere in his works; and
if he had stated it anywhere, Eusebius could hardly have overlooked
it. The conclusion, therefore, seems most probable that Eusebius
is right in correcting Irenaeus' statement, and that the latter based
his report upon a misinterpretation of Papias' own words.
In that
case, we have no authority for speaking of Papias as a disciple of
John the apostle.
* This sentence gives strong support to the view that oral tradi.
tions did not form the basis of i. ias' work, but that the basis con
sisted of written documents, which he interpreted, and to which he
then added the oral traditions which he refers to here. See Cent
femporary Review, 1885, II. p. 388 sq. The words rats pumveta is
have been translated by some scholars, "the interpretations of
them," thus making the book consist only of these oral traditions
with interpretations of them.
But this translation is not warranted
by the Greek, and the also at the beginning of the sentence shows
that the work must have contained other matter which preceded
these oral traditions and to which the "interpretations" belong.

* As Lightfoot points out (Contem/6. Rez'. Ford. p. 379 sq.),
Papias uses the term "elders " in a general sense to denote the
It
Fathers of the Church in the generations preceding his own.
thus includes both the apostles and their immediate ão. The
term was thus used in a general sense by later Fathers to denote all
earlier Fathers of the Church; that is, those leaders of the Church
belonging to generations earlier than the writers themselves. The
term, therefore, cannot be confined to the apostles alone, nor can it
be confined, as some have thought (e.g. Weissenbach in his /)as
Papias Fragment), to
officers, presbyters in the
ecclesiastical
official sense. Where the word mpeo Burepos is used in connection
with the second John (at the close of this extract srom Papias), it is
apparently employed in its official sense.
At least we cannot other
wise easily understand how it could be used as a peculiar designa
tion of this John, which should distinguish him from the other John.
For in the general sense of the word, in which Papias commonly
uses it, both Johns were elders. Compare Lightfoot's words in the
passage referred to above.

the books" would profit me as much as what
came from the living and abiding voice."
It is worth while observing here that the
name John is twice enumerated by him."
The first one he mentions in connection with
Peter and James and Matthew and the rest of
the apostles, clearly meaning the evangelist;
but the other John he mentions after an inter
val, and places him among others outside of the
number of the apostles, putting Aristion before
him, and he distinctly calls him a presby
ter.
This shows that the statement of those
is true, who say that there were two per
sons in Asia that bore the same name, and that
there were two tombs in Ephesus, each of which,
even to the present day, is called John's."
It is
important to notice this.
For it is probable
that it was the second, if one is not willing to
admit that it was the first that saw the Revela
tion, which is ascribed by name to John."
And Papias, of whom we are now speaking, confesses that he received the words
of the apostles from those that followed them,
but says that he was himself a hearer of Aristion.

mention of him by Papias.

* {x row BBAtov. These words have been interpreted by many
critics as implying that Papias considered the written Gospel ac
counts, which were extant in his time, of small value, and preserred
to them the oral traditions which he picked up from "the elders."
But as Lightfoot has shown (ibid. p. 399 sq.), this is not the natural
interpretation of Papias' words, and makes him practically stultisy
and contradict himself. He cannot have considered the written
documents which he laid at the base of his work as of little value,
nor can he have regarded the writings of Matthew and Mark, which
he refers to in this chapter as extant in his time, and the latter of
which he praises for its accuracy, as inferior to the oral traditions,
which came to him at best only at second hand.
It is necessary to
refer the row BBAtov, as Lightfoot does, to "interpretations" of
the Gospel accounts, which had been made by others, and to which
Papias prefers the interpretations or expositions which he has re
ceived from the disciples of the apostles.
This interpretation of
the word alone saves us from difficulties and Papias from seif.
stultification.

** See above, note 4.

* The existence of two tombs in Ephesus bearing the name of
John is attested also by Dionysius of Alexandria (quoted in Bk. VII.
chap. 25, below) and by Jerome (de 7's r. s. c. 9). The latter,
however, says that some regard them both as memorials of the one
John, the apostle; and Zahn, in his Acta Goannis, p. cliv. sq., en
deavors to prove that a church stood outside of the walls of Ephesus,
on the spot where John was buried, and another inside of the walls,
on the site of the house in which he had resided, and that thus two
spots were consecrated to the memory of a single John. The proof
which he brings in support of this may not lead many persons to
adopt his conclusions, and yet after reading his discussion of the
matter one must admit that à. existence of two memorials in Ephe
sus, such as Dionysius, Eusebius, and Jerome reser to, by no means
proves that more than one John was buried there.

* A similar suggestion had been already made by Dionysius in
the passage quoted by Eusebius in Bk. VII. chap. 25, and Eusebius
was undoubtedly thinking of it when he wrote these words. The
suggestion is a very clever one, and yet it is only a guess, and does
not pretend to be more. , Dionysius concludes that the Apocalypse
must have been written by some person named John, because it tes
tifies to that fact itself; but the style, and other internal indications,
lead him to think that it cannot have been written by the author of
the fourth Gospel, whom he assumes to be John the apostle. He is
therefore led to suppose that the Apocalypse was written by some
other John. He does not pretend to say who that John was, but
thinks it must have been some John that resided in Asia; and he
then adds that there were said to be two tombs in Ephesus bearing
the name of John, - evidently implying, though he does not say it.
that he is inclined to think that this second John thus commemorated

another wonderful story of Justus, surnamed

yet, by the grace of the Lord, suffered no

ll

no tradition whatever in favor of this theory, that it was solely an
hypothesis arising from critical difficulties, standing in, the way of
the ascription of the book to the apostle John.
Eusebius sees in
this suggestion a very welcome solution of the difficulties with which
he feels the acceptance of the book to be beset, and at once states it
as a possibility that this "presbyter John," whom he has discovered
in the writings of Papias, may have been the author of the book. But
the authenticity of the Apocalypse was too firmly established to be
shaken by such critical and theological difficulties as influenced
Dionysius, Eusebius, and a few others, and in consequence nothing
came of the suggestion made here by Eusebius.
In the present cen
tury, however, the "presbyter John " has again played an impor
tant part among some critics as the possible author of certain of the
Johannine writings, though the authenticity of the Apocalypse has
(until very recently) been so commonly accepted even by the most
negative critics that the "presbyter John " has not figured at all as
the author of it; nor indeed is he likely to in the future.

* That is, in the time of Philip.
* Compare the extract from Papias given by Irenaeus (Adz.
Her. V. 32), in which is contained a famous parable in regard to
the fertility of the millennium, which is exceedingly materialistic in
its nature, and evidently apocryphal. "The days will come when
vines shall grow, each having ten thousand branches, and in each
branch ten thousand twigs, and in each twig ten thousand shoots,
and in every one of the shoots ten thousand grapes, and every grape
when pressed will give five and twenty measures of wine," &c.

* Chiliasm, or millennarianism, - that is, the belief in a visible
reign of Christ on earth for a thousand years before the general
judgment, - was very widespread in the early Church. o
chiliasm was very common at about the beginning of the Christian
era, and is represented in the voluminous apocalyptic literature of
that day.
Christian chiliasm was an outgrowth of the Jewish, but
spiritualized it, and fixed it upon the second, instead of the first,
coming of Christ. The chief Biblical support for this doctrine is
found in Rev. xx. 1-6, and the fact that §. book was appealed to

through a misunderstanding of the apostolic ac
counts, not perceiving that the things said by
them were spoken mystically in figures.
For he appears to have been of very limited
understanding," as one can see from his
discourses.
But it was due to him that so many
of the Church Fathers after him adopted a like
opinion, urging in their own support the anti
quity of the man; as for instance Irenaeus and
any one else that may have proclaimed
similar views."
Papias gives also in his
own work other accounts of the words of
the Lord on the authority of Aristion who was
as handed
mentioned above, and traditions
down by the presbyter John ; to which we refer
those who are fond of learning.
But now we
must add to the words of his which we have
already quoted the tradition which he gives in
regard to Mark, the author of the Gospel.

so constantly by chiliasts in support of their views was the reason

See
Schaff's Church History, II. p. 613 sq., for the history of the doc
trine in the ante-Nicene Church and for the literature of the subject.
Eusebius' judgment of Papias may
have been unfavorably influenced by his hostility to the strong chili
asm of the latter; and yet a perusal of the extant fragments cf Pa
pias' writings will lead any one to think that Eusebius was not far
wrong in his estimate of the man. On the genuineness of the words

P. oo Papias is the first one to connect the Gospel of Mark with
Peter, but the tradition recorded by him was universally accepted by
those who came after him (see above, Bk. II. chap. 15, note 4).
The relation of this Gospel of Mark to our canonical Gospel has
been a very sharply disputed point, but there is no good reason for
istinguishing the Gospel referred to here from our second Gospel,
which corresponds excellently to the description given by Papias.
Compare the remarks of Lightfoot, ibid. p. 393 sq. We know from
other sources (e.g. Justin Ş., 19/a/. c. 106) that our second
Gospel was in existence in any case before the middle of the second
century, and therefore there is no reason to suppose that Papias was
thinking of any other Gospel when he spoke of the Gospel written
by Mark as the interpreter of Peter.
Of course it does not follow
from this that it was actually our second Gospel which Mark wrote,
and of whose composition Papias here speaks. He may have writ
ten a Gospel which afterward formed the basis of our present Gos
pel, or was one of the sources of the synoptic tradition as a whole;
that is, he may have written what is commonly known as the "Ur
Marcus" (see above, Bk. II. chap. 15, note 4). As to that, we
cannot decide with absolute certainty, but we may say that Papias
certainly understood the tradition which he gives to refer to our
Gospel of Mark. The exact significance of the word pumvent is as

it its usual significance, - the significance which we attach to the
English word "interpreter."
It
may be, supposing the report to be correct, that Peter found it ad
vantageous to have some one more familiar than himself with the
language of the people among whom he labored to assist him in his
preaching. What language it was for which he needed an inter
preter we cannot say. We might think naturally of Latin, but it is

THE WRITINGS OF PAPIAS.

For he neither heard the Lord nor followed him,
but afterward, as I said, he followed Peter, who
adapted his teaching to the needs of his hearers,
but with no intention of giving a connected ac
count of the Lord's discourses," so that Mark
committed no error while he thus wrote some
things as he remembered them.
For he was
careful of one thing, not to omit any of the
things which he had heard, and not to state any

by Papias concerning Mark.
But concern
ing Matthew he writes as follows: "So
then * Matthew wrote the oracles in the He
brew language, and every one interpreted them
as he was able." " And the same writer uses

not impossible that Greek or that both languages were meant; for
Peter, although of course possessed of some acquaintance with Greek,
might not have been familiar enough with it to preach in it with per
fect ease. The words "though not indeed in order" (ov uévrov rá
§et) have also caused considerable controversy.
But they seem to
refer chiefly to a lack of chronological arrangement, perhaps to a
lack of logical arrangement also. The implication is that Mark
wrote down without regard to order of any kind the words and deeds
of Christ which he remembered.
Lightfoot and most other critics
have supposed that this accusation of a "lack of order" implies the
existence of another written Gospel, exhibiting a different order,
with which Papias compares it (e.g. with the Gospel of Matthew, as
Weiss, Bleck, Holtzmann, and others think; or with John, as Light
foot, Zahn, Renan, and others suppose). This is a natural supposi
tion, but it is quite possible that É. in speaking of this lack of
order is not thinking at all of another written Gospel, but merely of
the order of events which he had received from tradition as the true

one.

it arose from Adyov under the influence of the Aoytov, which oc

different from our present Gospel.
Still our Greek Matthew is cer.

But if our Greek Matthew was known to Papias, and if
it is not a translation of a Hebrew original, then one of two alterna
tives follows: either he could not accept the Greek Matthew, which
was in current use (that is, our canonical Matthew), or else he was
not acquainted with the Hebrew Matthew. Of the former alterna
tive we have no hint in the fragments preserved to us, while the

with the Gospel according to the Hebrews (see above, chap. 25,

The list of Roman bishops which Eusebius gives is the same as
that of Irenaeus; but it has dates, while Irenaeus' has none. From
what source Eusebius took his dates we do not know.
His Chroni
cle contains different dates.
It is possible that the difference is
owing, in part, to defective transcriptions or translations; but it is
more probable that Eusebius himself discovered another source, be
fore writing his History, which he considered more authentic, and
therefore substituted for the one he had used in his Chronicle. Lip
sius (Chronologie der römischen / oschise, p. 145) says, "We may
assume that the oldest catalogue extended as far as Footno. but
rested upon historical knowledge only from Xystus, or, at the far
thest, from Alexander down." On the chronology of the Roman
bishops in general, see especially the important work of Lipsius just
referred to.

THE teaching and the Church of our

Jews increased, and they underwent a constant
succession of evils.

In the first attack it happened that they were
victorious over the Greeks, who fled to Alex

were in the city. But the Jews of Cyrene, although
deprived of their aid, continued to plunder the

* Lucius Quintus was an independent Moorish chies, who served

* The importance of Quadratus' Apology in the mind of Euse

it, as well as by the fact that he gives it also in his Chronicle, year
2041 of Abraham (124 to 125 A.D.), where he calls Quadratus "... 1 u

cle, and therefore the reference to this is all the more significant.
We find no mention of Quadratus and Aristides before Eusebius,
and of the Apology of Quadratus we have only the few lines which
are given in this chapter. In the Chronicle Eusebius says that
Quadratus and Aristides addressed apologies to Hadrian during his
stay in Athens. One MS. of the Chronicle gives the date as 125
A.D..(2141 Abr.), and this is correct; for, according to Dürr (Die
Reisen des Kaisers Hadrian, Wien, 1881, p. 42 to 44, and 7o to 71),
Hadrian was in Athens from the fall of 125 to the summer of 126 and
from the spring of 129 to the spring of 130.
Eusebius adds in his
Chronicle (but omits here) that these apologies were the cause of a
favorable edict from Hadrian, but this is incorrect.
Eusebius (IV. 12)
makes a similar statement in regard to the Apology of Justin, making a
favorable edict (which has been proved to be unauthentic) of the Em

Quadratus, of of Athens in the time of Marcus Aurelius, who

to the time of the apostles can hardly have been a bishop during
the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Nor is there any decisive ground to
identify him with the prophet mentioned in Bk. }T. chap. 37 and Bk.
V. chap. 7, for Quadratus was a very common name, and o prophet
And the apologist seem to have belonged to different countries (see
Harnack, Urðerlieserung der griech. Apos. p. 103). Many schol
ars, however, identify the prophet and the apologist, and it must be
said that Eusebius' mention of the prophet in III. 37, and of the
apologist in IV. 3, without any qualifying phrases, looks as if one
well-known Quadratus were referred to. The matter must remain
undecided. Jerome speaks of Quadratus and Aristides once in the
Chronicle, year 2142, and in de vir, ill, chap. 19 and 20.
In chap.
19 he identifies Quadratus, the apologist, and Quadratus, the bishop
of Athens, but he evidently had no other source than Eusebius (as

our religion," because certain wicked men" had
attempted to trouble the Christians. The work
is still in the hands of a great many of the
brethren, as also in our own, and furnishes clear
proofs of the man's understanding and of
his apostolic orthodoxy." He himself re
veals the early date at which he lived in the
following words: "But the works of our Saviour
were always present," for they were genuine : -
those that were healed, and those that were
raised from the dead, who were seen not only
when they were healed and when they were raised,
but were also always present; and not merely
while the Saviour was on earth, but also after his
death, they were alive for quite a while, so that
some of them lived even to our day."" Such
then was Quadratus.

Aristides also, a believer earnestly devoted to our religion, left, like Quadratus, an
apology for the
faith, addressed to Adrian."
His work, too, has been preserved even to the
present day by a great many persons.

the Fathers.
His authorship was disputed by Jerome and others,
and the work from that time on was commonly assigned to a heathen
author, until recently some voices have again been heard in favor of
the authorship of Bishop Sixtus (notably de Lagarde and Ewald).

we have any means of ascertaining, and it may be assumed that he
was the first one that occupied an episcopal position in Rome; and
et, even in his time, the monarchical episcopate can hardly have
§: established in its full sense.
In the next chapter we are told
that he held office ten years; and this figure, which is supported by
most of the ancient catalogues, may be accepted as approximately
correct. The date of his accession given here by Eusebius cannot,
however, be correct; for, as Lipsius has shown (Chron. de room.
Aischö/e, p. 183 sq.) he must have died at least as early as 126 A.D.
(possibly as early as 124), so that his accession took place not later
than 116; that is, before the death of Trajan.
Like most of the other
early Roman bishops he is celebrated as a martyr in the martyrolo
ies, but the fact of his martyrdom rests upon a very late and worth
ess tradition.

* On Primus, see chap. 1, note 4.

Eusebius contradicts his own
dates here.
For in chap. 1 he says that Alexander of Rome and
Primus of Alexandria became bishops at the same time; but accord

source Nicephorus drew we do not know. He is, at any rate, too
late to be of any worth as an authority on such a subject.
In fact,
these men were not regular monarchical bishops, holding office in
succession (see note 4), and hence Eusebius is quite excusable for
his ignorance in o to their dates.
See Ritschl's Amtsteh ong
der alt-kath. Kirche, p. 246 sq.
* Reuterdahl ( />e Fontibus Hist. eccles. Ense?., p. 55) conjec
tures that these "writings" were found in the church of éon,
itself, and compares a passage in the Dem. Ezang. III. 5: "The
first bishops that presided there [i.e. at Jerusalem] are said to have
been Jews, and their names are preserved by the inhabitants of the
country." Had Hegesippus or any other known author been the
source of his information, he would probably have mentioned his
nastle.

See below, chap. 7.

* In 135 A.D.
* From Hegesippus (see above, ão. III. chap. 32) we learn that
Symeon, the successor of James, was martyred during Trajan's
reign.
As was seen in note 6 of the chapter referred to, the martyr
dom probably occurred early in that reign; Eusebius, in his Chron.,
refers the martyrdom and the accession of Justus to the tenth year
of Trajan (107 A.D.).
This leaves thirteen bishops to be inserted
between 107 (or, if this date is not reliable, 98+) and 135 A.D., which
is, to say the least, very suspicious. The true explanation appears
to be that, after the death of Symeon, the last prominent relative of

whom are said to have been of Hebrew descent,
and to have received the knowledge of Christ in
purity, so that they were approved by those who
were able to judge of such matters, and were
deemed worthy of the episcopate.
For their
whole church consisted then of believing He
brews who continued from the days of the apos
tles until the siege which took place at this time;
in which siege the Jews, having again rebelled
against the Romans, were conquered after
severe battles.
But since the bishops of
the circumcision ceased at this time, it is
proper to give here a list of their names from
the beginning. The first, then, was James, the
so-called brother of the Lord ; "the second, Sym
eon;" the third, Justus;' the fourth, Zacchaeus;*
the fifth, Tobias; the sixth, Benjamin ;
the
seventh, John ; the eighth, Matthias; the ninth,
Philip ; the tenth, Seneca;" the eleventh, Justus;
the twelfth, Levi ; the thirteenth, Ephres;" the
fourteenth, Joseph ;" and finally, the fif
teenth, Judas.
These are the bishops on
Jerusalem that lived between the age of the
apostles and the time referred to, all of them
belonging to the circumcision.

In the twelfth year of the reign of Adrian,
Xystus, having completed the tenth year of

Christ, the presbyters took the lead, and that they were afterward
Closs and
made by tradition into successive monarchical bishops.
Gieseler suppose that there were bishops of a number of churches in
Palestine at the same time, whom tradition made successive bishops
of Jerusalem.
But the fact is, that the episcopate is of Greek, not
of Jewish, origin, and in the strictly Jewish Christian churches of
Palestine no such person as a bishop can have existed. Only after
the church there came under the influence of the Gentile church,
and lost its prevailingly Jewish character, was it possible for a
bishop, in the general sense of the term, to exist there. The Jewish
Christians assumed for their church government the form of the
Jewish Sanhedrim, though while James and Symeon were alive, they
were naturally leaders (according to the common Oriental custom,
which exalted the relatives of the founder of a religion). The Jew
ish character of the Jerusalem congregation was very marked until
the destruction of the city under Hadrian (note that all but two of
the fifteen bishops have }... names), after which all circumcised
'...l.o. as well as unbelievers - were excluded, and a
eathen Christian congregation took its place (see the next chapter).
According to so by Closs, Stigloher, and Heinichen,
the church of Jerusalem remained in Pella after 70 A.D., and was
called the church of Jerusalem because it was made up of Christians
from Jerusalem.
This is possible; but Eusebius evidently did not
understand it so (compare, too, his 19em. Evans. III. 5), and Epi
phanius (de Moosa et Pond. chap. 15) says expressly that, after the
destruction of the city by Titus, the church returned again to Jeru
salem, and there is no good reason to doubt the report.

was used to the exclusion of the latter. The name therefore docs

The Last Siege of the 7ews under Adrian.

As the rebellion of the Jews at this time
grew much more serious," Rufus, governor
of Judea, after an auxiliary force had been sent
him by the emperor, using their madness as a
pretext, proceeded against them without mercy,
and destroyed indiscriminately thousands of
men and women and children, and in accord
ance with the laws of war reduced their
country to a state of complete subjection.

too old to be doubted. Eusebius here agrees with Jerome's version
of the Chron. in putting the date of T. accession in the
year 128 A.D., but the Armenian version puts it in 124; and Lipsius,

and other ancient catalogues), he must have died, according to
Lipsius and Overbeck, between 135 and 137 A.D. (the latter being
robably the correct date), and not in the first year of Antoninus
}. (138 A.D.), as Eusebius states in chap. Io, below.
Tradition
says that he fought against Marcion and Valentinus (which is quite
possible), and that he was very strict, in regard to fasts, sharpening
them and increasing their number, which may or may not be true.

eroine.

* The rebellions of the Jews which had broken out in Cyrene
and elsewhere during the reign of Trajan only increased the cruelty
of the Romans toward them, and in Palestine, as well as elsewhere
in the East, their position was growing constantly worse. Already
during the reign of Trajan Palestine itself was the scene of many
minor disturbances and of much bitter persecution.
Hadrian re
garded them as a troublesome people, and showed in the beginning
of his reign that he was not very favorably disposed toward them.
Indeed, it seems that he even went so far as to determine to build
upon the site of Jerusalem a purely heathen city.
It was at about
this time, when all the Jews were longing for the Messiah, that a
man appeared (his original name we do not know, but his coins
make it probable that it was Simon), claiming to be the Messiah,
and promising to free the Jews from the Roman yoke. He took the
name Bar-Cochba, "Son of a star," and was enthusiastically sup
rted by Rabbi Akiba and other leading men among the Jews, who

upon the site of Jerusalem a new city, which he named Aelia Capi
tolina, and upon the site of the temple a new temple to the Capitoline
Jupiter, and passed a law that no Jew should henceforth enter the
lace. Under Bar-Cochba the Christians, who refused to join him
in his rebellion, were very cruelly treated (cf. Justin Martyr, Apol.
1. 31, quoted in chap. 8, below). Upon this last war of the Jews,

and he pretended that he was a star that had
come down to them out of heaven to bring them
light in the midst of their
misfortunes.
The war raged most fiercely in the eigh
teenth year of Adrian," at the city of Bith
ara," which was a very secure fortress, situated
not far from Jerusalem. When the siege had
lasted a long time, and the rebels had been
driven to the last extremity by hunger and thirst,
and the instigator of the rebellion had suffered
his just punishment, the whole nation was pro
hibited from this time on by a decree, and by
the commands of Adrian, from ever going up to
the country about Jerusalem.

And
thus, when the city had been emptied of

destruction of its ancient inhabitants, it was col

which subsequently arose changed its name and
was called AElia, in honor of the emperor AElius

strongly fortified place, and that it was situated somewhere in Judea.

of it, was taken by Eusebius from Aristo of Pella, we do not know.
Of Aristo of Pella himself we know very little.
Eusebius is the first
writer to mention him, and he and Maximus Confessor (in his notes
on the work De mystica Theol. cap. I. p. 17, ed. Corderii) are the
only ones to give us any information about him (for the notices in
Moses Chorenensis and in the Chron. Paschale - the only other

Maximus informs us that Aristo was the author of a Dialogue of
Papascus and 9ason, a work mentioned by many of the Fathers,
but connected by none of them with Aristo. The dialogue, accord
ing to Maximus, was known to Clement of Alexandria, and there
fore must have been written as early as, or very soon after, the mid
dle of the second century; and the fact that it recorded a dialogue
between a Hebrew Christian and an Alexandrian Jew (as we learn
from the epistle of Celsus, De judaica /ncredu Zitate, printed with
the works of Cyprian, in Hartel's edition, III. p. 119-132) would
lead us to expect an early date for the work. There can be found
no good reason for doubting the accuracy of Maximus' statement;
and if it be accepted, we must conclude that the writer whom Euse

Eusebius drew the account which he here ascribes to Aristo; for
such an account might well find a place in a dialogue between two
Hebrews.
It is possible, of course, that Aristo wrote some other
work in which he discussed this subject; but if it had been an his
torical work, we should expect Eusebius, according to his custom,

the work did not please him, and hence he neither mentions it, nor
ives an account of its author.
This is just what we should expect
usebius' attitude to be toward such a Jewish Christian work (and
at the same time, such a ‘simple' work, as Origen calls it in Centra
Cels. IV. 52) as we know the dialogue to have been. We are, of
course, ić largely to conjecture in this matter; but the above con
clusions seem at least probable. Compare Harnack's Ucoordic/erung der griech. A/o., p. 115 sq.; and for a discussion of the
nature of the dialogue (which is no longer extant), see his . 12ter

logue).

In his
opinion, heresy was not a natural growth from within, but an exter
nal evil brought upon the Church by the devil, when he could
no longer persecute.
According to this conception the Church
conquers this external enemy, heresy, and then goes on as before,
unaffected by it.
In agreement with this is his conception of here
tics themselves, whom he, in common with most other Christians
of that age, considered without exception wicked and abandoned
characters.

Hadrian is an illusion (see below, chap. 8, note 14) which falls in

Gnostics.
Irenaeus (I. 24) and the early Compendium of Hip
polytus (now lost, but used together with Irenaeus' work by Epipha
nius in his treatise against heresies) described a form of Basili
dianism which was not the original, but a later corruption of the
system. On the other hand, Clement of Alexandria surely, and

prominent one known to us); and though his system created a great
impression at the start, - so much so that his name always remained
one of the most famous of Gnostic names, - it had little vitality,
and soon died out or was corrupted beyond recognition.

mentioned of course in all the general works against heresies written
by the Fathers, but no one seems to have composed an especial res

Irenaeus informs us that he taught at Alexandria, Hippo
refers.
lytus (VII. 15) mentions simply Egypt, while Epiphanius ox'. 1)
names various Egyptian cities in which he labored, but it is evident
that he is only enumerating places, in which there, were Basilidians
in his time.
It is not certain whether he is to be identified with the
Basilides who is mentioned in the Acts of Archela zos as preaching
in Persia.

10 The only one of these-"that furnished posterity with means
of defense against heresies"- whom Eusebius mentions is Agrippa
Castor, and it is evident that he knew of no others.
Moreover, it is
inorc than doubtful whether Agrippa Castor belonged to that time.
We do not know when he wrote, §: it is hardly possible that the
Church had at that period any one capable of answering such a work
as the Commentary of Basilides, or any one who would wish to is he
could. The activity of the Church was at this early period devoted
chiefly if not wholly to the production of apologies for the defense
of the Church against the attacks of enemies from the outside, and
to theo of apocalypses.
Eusebius in the next chapter
mentions Hegesippus as ... of these "writers of the time."
then only proves that the events mentioned took place him. his
But the passage which he quotes to prove that Hegesippus wrote
lifetime, and not necessarily within forty or fifty years of the time
at which he was writing. The fact is, that Hegesippus really wrote
about 175 A.D. (later therefore than Justin Martyr), and in chap.
21 of this book Eusebius restores him to his proper chronological
place. The general statement made here by Eusebius in regard to
the writers against heresy during the reign of Hadrian rest upon his
preconceived idea of what must have been the case.
If the devil
raised up enemies against the truth, the Church must certainly have
had at the same time defenders to meet them.
It is a simple exam
ple of well-meaning subjective reconstruction. He had the work
of Agrippa Castor before him, and undoubtedly believed that he lived
at the time stated (which indeed we cannot absolutely deny), and
believed, moreover, that other similar writers, whose names he did
not know, lived at the same time.

11 Of Agrippa Castor we know only what Fusebius tells us here.
Jerome (de zir. //, chap. 21) adds nothing new, and Theodoret's
statement (Fał. I. 4), ". Agrippa wrote against Basilides' son,

shows the terrible imposture of the man.
While exposing his mysteries he says that

title, has entirely disappeared.

12 ei; to evayyeatov 8.8Aia. Clement of Alexandria (Strom. IV.
12) quotes from the twenty-third book of the E-regetica of Basilides.
Origen (Hom. in Luc. I.) says that Basilides "had even the audac
ity to write a Gospel according to Basilides," and this remark is
repeated by Ambrose (Ea:A. in Luc. I. 1), and seems to be Jerome's
authority for the enumeration of a Gospel of Basilides among the
Apocryphal Gospels in his Cornment in Matt., A'raf . We i.
nothing more about this Gospel, and it is quite possible that Origen
mistook the E-regetica for a Gospel. We do not know upon what
Gospels Basilides wrote his Commentary (or Exegetica), but it is
hardly probable that he would have expounded his own Gospel even
if such a work existed. The passage from the Ae regetica which
Clement quotes looks to me like a part of an exposition of John ix.
go Lipsius, in the Dict. of Christ. Biog. II. 715, suggests
uke xxi. 12). Meanwhile, in the Acta Archelaf, chap. 55 (see
Gallandri Biłs. PP. III. 608), is a quotation from "the thirteenth
book of the treatises (tractato, um) of Basilides," which is an expo
sition of the parable of Dives and Lazarus (Luke xvi.).
If this is
the same work, it would seem that the E-vegetica must have included
at least Luke and John, possibly Matthew also, for we know that
the Gospels of Matthew, Luke, and John were all used by the Basili
dians. The respective positions in the work of the expositions of
the o: from Luke and John (the former in the thirteenth, the
latter in the twenty-third, book), would seem, however, to exclude
Matthew, if the books were at all of equal length.
If Lipsius were
correct in regarding the latter passage as an exposition of Luke xxi.
12, there would be no evidence that the Commentary covered more
than a single Gospel.

13 According to Epiphanius, some of the Ophites appealed to a
certain prophet called Barcabbas. What his connection was with
the one mentioned here we do not know.
Clement of Alexandria
(Strom. VI. 6) speaks of the Expositions of the Prophet Parchor
by Isidore, the son of Basilides. This may be another of Basilides'
prophets, but is more probably identical with the oft-mentioned Bar
Fo In the second book of these Expositions, as quoted by
Clement, occurs a reference to the prophecy of Cham or Ham. Rien
stra (De Euseb. Hist. Eccles...,p. 29) thinks that Agrippa Castor
was mistaken in saying that Basilides mentioned these prophets; but
there seems to be no good reason to deny the accuracy of the re
port, even though we know nothing more about the prophets men
tioned.
Hort (Dict. of Christ. Biog., article Barcabóas) thinks it
likely that the prophecies current among the various Gnostic bodies
belonged to the apocryphal Zoroastrian literature.

* This was not a doctrine of Basilides himself, but of his sol
lowers (compare the accounts of Irenaeus and Hippolytus). If
Agrippa Castor represented Basilides' position thus, as Eusebius
says he did (though Eusebius may be only following frenaeus), it is
an evidence that he did not live at the early date to which Eusebius
assigns him, and this goes to confirm the view stated above, in note
1o.
Basilides himself taught at least a moderate asceticism, while
his followers went off into crude dualism and moral license (see the
excellent account of Schaff, Ch. Hist. II. 466 sq.).

* Exactly what is meant by this "five years of silence" is un
certain.
Whether it denoted unquestioning and silent obedience of
all commands, as it meant in the case of the Pythagoreans (if, in
deed, the traditions in regard to the latter have any basis in fact), or
strict secrecy as to the doctrines taught, cannot be decided. The
report in regard to the Basilidians, in so far as it has any truth,
Foly arose on the ground of some such prohibition, which may
ave been made by some follower of Basilides, if not by the latter
himself. A bond of secrecy would lend an air of mystery to the
school, which would accord well with the character of its later teach
ings.
But we cannot make Basilides responsible for such proceed
ings. Agrippa Castor, as reproduced here by Eusebius, is our sole
authority for the enjoinment of silence by Basilides.

naeus also writes" that Carpocrates was a con
temporary of these men, and that he was the
father of another heresy, called the heresy of
the Gnostics," who did not wish to transmit any
longer the magic arts of Simon, as that one" had
done, in secret, but openly."
For they boasted
- as of something great - of love potions that
were carefully prepared by them, and of certain
demons that sent them dreams and lent them
their protection, and of other similar agencies;
and in accordance with those things they taught
that it was necessary for those who wished to
enter fully into their mysteries, or rather into
their abominations, to practice all the worst
kinds of wickedness, on the ground that they
could escape the cosmic powers, as they called
them, in no other way than by discharging their

Indeed,
all the requisit; conditions existed from the beginning.
It was the
"acute Verweltlichung" (as Harnack calls it) of Christianity, the
development of it in connection with the various ethnic philosophics,
and it began as soon as Christianity came in contact with the Greek
mind.
At first it was not heretical, simply because there were no
standards by which to try it. There was only the preaching of the
Christians; the canon was not yet formed; episcopacy was not yet

the time of Hadrian, perhaps, that these speculations began to be
regarded as heresies, because they contradicted certain fundamental
truths to which the Christians felt that they must cling, such as the
unity of God, his graciousness, his goodness, etc.; and therefore
the Christians dated Gnosticism from that time.
Gnosticism was
ostensibly conquered, but victory was achieved only as the Church
itself became in a certain sense Gnostic.
It followed the course of
Gnosticism a century later; that is, it wrote commentaries, systems
of doctrine, &c., philosophizing about religious things (cf. Hasnack's
196&m engeschichte, I. p. 162 sq.).
It must be remembered in read
ing the Fathers' accounts of Gnosticism that they took minor and
unimportant details and magnified them, and treated them as the
essentials of the system or systems.
In this way far greater variety
appears to have existed in Gnosticism than was the case. The es
sential principles were largely the same throughout; the differences
were chiefly in regard to details. ... It is this conduct on the part of
the Fathers that gives us such a distorted and often ridiculous view
of Gnosticism.

The Carpocratians are the first of whom Irenaeus expressly says
that they called themselves Gnostics (adr". Haer. I. 25, 6), while
Hippolytus first speaks of the name as adopted by the Naasseni
(V. 1). The Carpocratians are mentioned by Hegesippus (quoted
below in chap. 22). The system was more exclusively Greek in its
character than any other of the Gnostic systems.

obligations to them all by infamous con
duct. Thus it came to pass that the malig
nant demon, making use of these ministers,
on the one hand enslaved those that were so
pitiably led astray by them to their own destruc
tion, while on the other hand he furnished to
the unbelieving heathen abundant opportunities
for slandering the divine word, inasmuch as the
reputation of these men brought infamy
upon the whole race of Christians.
In this
way, therefore, it came to pass that there
was spread abroad in regard to us among the
unbelievers of that age, the infamous and most
unlawful
absurd suspicion that we practiced
commerce with mothers and sisters, and
enjoyed impious feasts." He did not, how
ever, long succeed in these artifices, as the
truth established itself and in time shone
with great brilliancy. For the machinations
of its enemies were refuted by its power
and speedily vanished. One new heresy arose
after another, and the former ones always passed
away, and now at one time, now at another, now
in one way, now in other ways, were lost in ideas
of various kinds and various forms.
But the
splendor of the catholic and only true Church,
which is always the same, grew in magnitude
and power, and reflected its piety and simpli
city and freedom, and the modesty and purity of
its inspired life and philosophy to every na
tion both of Greeks and of Barbarians. At the
same time the slanderous accusations which
had been brought against the whole Church"

* The chief accusations urged against the early Christians by
their antagonists were atheism, cannibalism, and incest. These
charges were made very early.
Justin Martyr (A/o/. I. 26) men
tions them, and Pliny in his epistle to Trajan speaks of the innocent
meals of the Christians, implying that they had been accused of
immorality in connection with them.
(Compare, also, Tertullian's
A fos. 7, 8, and Ad Nationes, 7.)
In fact, suspicions arose among
the heathen as soon as their love feasts became secret., The perse
cution in Lyons is to be explained only by the belief of the officers
that these and similar accusations were true. The Christians com
monly denied all such charges in toto, and supported their denial by
urging the absurdity of such conduct; but sometimes, as in the
present case, they endeavored to exonerate themselves by attrib
uting the crimes with which they were charged to heretics.
This
course, however, helped them little with the heathem, as the latter
did not distinguish between the various parties of Christians, but
treated them all as one class. The statement of Eusebius in the
present case is noteworthy. He thinks that the crimes were really
committed by heretics, and occasioned the accusations of the heathen,
and he thus admits that the charges were founded upon fact.
In
this case he acts toward the heretics in the same way that the hea
then acted toward the Christians as a whole.
This method of exon
erating themselves appears as early as Justin Martyr (compare his
440/. I. 26).
Irenaeus also (I. 25, 3), whom Eusebius substantially
follows in this passage, and Philaster (c. 57), pursue tie same
cotl risc.

* Eusebius is correct in his statement that such accusations were
no longer made in his day. The Church had, in fact, lived them
It is noticeable that in the elaborate work of

Celsus against the Christians, no such charges are found.
From
Origen (Contra Cess. VI. 27), however, we learn that there were
still in his time some who believed these reports about the Chris
tians, though they were no longer made the basis of serious attacks.
Whether Eusebius' synchronization of the cessation of these slan
derous stories with the cessation of the heresies of which he has
been talking, is correct, is not so certain, as we know neither exactly
when these heresies ran out, nor precisely the time at which the
accusations ceased.
At any rate, we cannot fully agree with Euse
bius' explanation of the matter. The two things were hardly con
nected as direct cause and effect, though it cannot be denied that
the actual immoralities of some of these antinomian sects may have
had some effect in confirming these tales, and hence that their ex

happened in the time of the apostles ac

ets."

At the same time also Justin, a genuine lover
of the true philosophy, was still continuing
to busy himself with Greek literature." He indi
cates this time in the Apology which he addressed
to Antonine, where he writes as follows:" "We

Emperor Hadrian, and the object of his extravagant affections. He
was probably drowned in the Nile, in 130 A.D.
After his death he
was raised to the rank of the gods, and temples were built for his
worship in many parts of the empire, especially in Egypt. In Athens
too games were instituted in his honor, and games were also cele
brated every fifth year at Mantinea, in Arcadia, according to Vale

borhood Antinois was drowned, and called it Antinoëpolis.

* On Justin Martyr, see chap. 16, below. We do not know the
date of his conversion, but as it did not take place until mature years,
it is highly probable that he was still a heathen during the greater
part of Hadrian's reign. There is no reason, however, to suppose
that Eusebius is speaking here with more than approximate accu
racy. He may not have known any better than we the exact time
of Justin's conversion.

which took place at that time, adds the
following:' "For in the late Jewish war Barco

manded that Christians alone * should be visited

Eusebius here quotes from what is now

his quotations in chaps. 16 and 17, below.

11 The best MSS. of Eusebius write the name Siepevytos Tpavvavós,
but one M.S., supported by Syncellus, writes the first word Siepevios.
Rufinus writes "Screnius"; Jerome, in his version of Eusebius'
Chronicle, followed by Orosius (VII, 13), writes "Serenius Gra
nius," and this, according to Kortholdt (quoted by Heinichen), is
shown by an inscription to have been the correct form (see Hein
ichen's cdition, in loco). We know no more of this man, except
that he was Minucius Fundanus' predecessor as proconsul of Asia,
as we learn from the opening scntence of the rescript quoted in the
next chapter.

** Ypau wara. The plural is often used like the Latin literae to
denote a single cpistle, and we learn from the opening sentence of
the rescript itself (if the Greek of Eusebius is to be relied on) that
Hadrian replies, not to a number of letters, but to a single one, -
an Tea foam, as Eusebius calls it.

** a virtypalat.
'...This Minucius Fundanus is the same person that is addressed
by Pliny, EA. I. # (see Mommsen's note in Keil's cq., of Pliny's
epistles, p. 419).
e is mentioned also by Melito (Eusebius, IV. 26)
as proconsul of Asia, and it is there, said that Hadrian wrote to him
concerning the Christians. The authenticity of this rescript is a dis
puted point.
Keim (Theol. 9ahrācher, 1856, p. 387 sqi.) was the
first to dispute its genuineness. He has been followed by many
scholars, especially Overbeck, who gives a very keen discussion of

manding him to condemn no one without an
indictment and a well-grounded accusation.
And he gives a copy of the epistle, preserv
ing the original Latin in which it was writ
ten," and prefacing it with the following words: "
"Although from the epistle of the greatest and
most illustrious Emperor Adrian, your father, we
have good ground to demand that you order
judgment to be given as we have desired, yet we
have asked this not because it was ordered by
Adrian, but rather because we know that what
we ask is just. And we have subjoined the copy
of Adrian's epistle that you may know that we are

the various edicts of the early emperors relating to the Christians in
his Studient zur Gesch. der alten Kirche, I. p. 93 sqq. The genu
ineness of the edict, however, has been defended against Keim's
attack by Wieseler, Renan, Lightfoot, and others. The whole ques
tion hinges upon the interpretation of the rescript.
According to
Gieseler, Neander, and some others, it is aimed only against tumultu
ous proceedings, and, far from departing from the principle laid down
by Trajan, is an attempt to return to that princi o and to substitute
orderly judicial processes for popular attacks.
If this be the sense
of the edict, there is no reason to doubt its genuineness, but the next
to the last sentence certainly cannot be interpreted in that way: "if
any one therefore brings an accusation, and shows that they have
done something contrary to the laws (to mapa rows wou ovs) deter
mine thus according to the heinousness of the crime " (kata 1 my
& was ov too duaprimulatos).
These last words are very significant.
They certainly imply various crimes of which the prisoners are sup
According to the heinousness of these crimes
posed to be accused.
the punishment is to be regulated.
In other words, the trial of the
Christians was to be for the purpose of ascertaining whether they
were guilty of moral or political crimes, not whether they merely
professed Christianity; that is, the profession of Christianity, ac
cording to this rescript, is not treated as a crime in and of itself.
If the edict then be genuine, Hadrian reversed completely Tra
jan's principle of procedure which was to punish the profession of
Christianity in and of itself as a crime.
But in the time of Anto
minus Pius and Marcus Aurelius the rescript of Trajan is seen still to
be in full force.
For this and other reasons presented by Keim and
Overbeck, I am constrained to class this edict with those of Antoni
nus Pius and Marcus Aurelius as a forgery.
It can hardly have
been composed while Hadrian was still alive, but must have been
forged ... Justin wrote his Apology, for he gives it as a genuine
edict, i.e. it must belong to the early part of the reign of Antoninus
Pius.

The illusion under which the early Christian writers labored in re
gard to the relations of the emperors to Christianity is very remarka
ble. Both Melito and Tertullian state that no emperor had persecuted
the Christians except Nero and Domitian. Christian writers through
out the second century talk in fact as if the mode of treatment which
they were receiving was something new and strange, and in oppo
sition to the better treatment which previous emperors had accorded
the Christians.
In doing this, they ignore entirely the actual edicts
of the emperors, all of which are now lost, and notice only forged
edicts which are favorable to the Christians; when and by whom
they were forged we do not know. Thus Tertullian, in addressing
Septimius Severus, speaks of the favors which his predecessors had
granted the Christians and contrasts their conduct with his; Melito
addresses Marcus Aurelius in the same way, and so Justin addresses
Antoninus Pius.
This method probably arose from a misunder
standing of the original edict of Trajan o Bk. III. chap. 33, note 6),
which they all considered favorable, and therefore presupposed a
friendly attitude on the part of the emperors toward the ğ.
which, not finding in their own age, they naturally transferred to a
previous age.
This led gradually to the idea - which Lactantius
first gives precise expression to - that only the bad emperors perse
cuted Christianity, while the good ones were favorable to it.
But
after the empire became Christian, the belief became common that
all the heathen emperors had been persecutors, the good as well as
the bad: - all the Christian emperors were placed upon one level,
latter being looked upon,
and all the heathen on another, the
like Nero and Domitian, as wicked tyrants.

to Our two MSS. of Justin have substituted the Greek, transla
tion of Eusebius for the Latin original given by the former. Rufinus,
however, in his version of Eusebius' History, gives a Latin translo

Rufino, p. 175 sq., and Lightfoot's Jonatius, I., p. 463 sq., and see
Otto's Corao Azor. I. p. 100 sq., where the edict is given, both in
the Greek of our MSS. of join and in the Latin of Rufinus, Keim
(A us dem Urch rostenth rim, p. 184 sq.) contends that the Latin of
Rufinus is not the original, but a translation of Eusebius' Greek.
His arguments, however, do not possess any real weight, and the
majority of scholars accept Kimmel's view.

After these words the
author referred to gives the rescript in
Latin, which we have translated into Greek as
accurately as we could."

It reads as follows:

an

"To Minucius Fundanus. I have received
epistle," written to me by Serennius
Granianus, a most illustrious man, whom you
have succeeded.
It does not seem right to me
that the matter should be passed by without
examination, lest the men" be harassed and
opportunity be given to the informers for
practicing villainy.
If, therefore, the inhab
itants of the province can clearly sustain
this petition against the Christians so as to give
answer in a court of law, let them pursue this
course alone, but let them not have resort to
men's petitions and outcries.
For it is far more
proper, if any one wishes to make an accu
sation, that you should examine into it.
If any one therefore accuses them and
shows that they are doing anything con
trary to the laws, do you pass judgment accord
ing to the heinousness of the crime."
But, by
Hercules
if any one bring an accusation
through mere calumny, decide in regard to his
criminality," and see to it that you inflict pun
ishment." "

Such are the contents of Adrian's rescript.

* We cannot judge as to the faithfulness of the Grcck trans
lation which follows, because we are not absolutely sure whether
the Latin of Rufinus is
its original, or itself a translation of it.
Rufinus, however, agree very well, and if the
Eusebius, and
Latin of Rufinus is the original of Eusebius' translation, the lat
ter has succeeded much better than the Greek translator of the
4/o'oy of Tertullian referred to in Bk. II. chap. 2, above. We
should, expect, however, that much greater pains would be taken
with the translation of a brief official document of this kind than
with such a work as Tertullian's 4Aology, and Eusebius' translation
of the rescript does not by any means prove
he was a fluent
Latin scholar. As remarked above (Bk. II. chap. 2, note oy, he
probably had comparatively little acquaintance with the Latin, but
enough to enable him to translate brief passages for himself in cases
of necessity.

* Greek, on to roamv; Latin, Witteras.

* This is the only really suspicious sentence in the cdict. That
Hadrian should desire to protect his Christian subjects as well as
others from tumultuous and illegal proceedings, and from unfounded
accusations, would be of course quite natural, and quite in accord
with the spirit shown by Trajan in his rescript.
But in this one
sentence, he implies that the Christians are to be condemned only
for actual crimes, and that the mere profession of Christianity is not

wise be o to accept the edict as genuine, - natural as the

style is and the position taken in the other portions of it, - this one
sentence, considered in the light of all that we know of the attitude
of Hadrian's predecessors and successors toward the Christians, and
of all that we can gather of his own views, must, as I believe, con
demn it as a forgery.

* Compare this sentence with the closing words of the forged
cdict of Antoninus Pius quoted by Eusebius in chap. 13. Not only
are the Christians to be released, but their accusers are to be pun.
ished.
Still there is a difference between the two commands in that
here only an accusation made with the purpose of slander is to be
punished, while there the accuser is to be unconditionally held as
guilty, if actual crimes are not proved against the accused Christian.

injunction to enforce the law forbidding slander against those who
should slanderously accuse the Christians is not inconsistent with
the principles of Trajan and Hadrian, and hence not of itself alone

time of Hyginus, the ninth "bishop, and made
confession, and continued
this way, now
teaching in secret, now making confession again,
and now denounced for corrupt doctrine and

These words are found in the third book of
the work Against Heresies. And again in
the first book he speaks as follows concern
ing Cerdon : ""A certain Cerdon, who had taken
his system from the followers of Simon, and had
come to Rome under Hyginus, the ninth in the
episcopal succession from the apostles,' taught
that the God proclaimed by the law and proph
ets was not the father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For the former was known, but the latter un

Epiphanius speaks of a sect of Cerdonians, but there seems never
to have been such a sect, and his disciples probably early became
followers of Marcion, who joined Cerdon soon after reaching Rome.

making no attempt to distinguish their doctrines.
Irenaeus, in the
assage quoted, and the lost Syntagma of Hippolytus (represented
§ Pseudo-Tertullian's Adv. Haer. and by Epiphanius), distinguish
the two, treating Cerdon separately but very briefly. The doctrines
of Cerdon, however, given by them, are identical with or at least
very similar to the known views of Marcion.
If they were really
Cerdon's positions before Marcion came to him, then his influence
over Marcion was most decided.

* On Marcion, see below, note 24.
* The Latin text of Irenaeus here reads "eighth '' instead of

"ninth." Sce below, note 7.

strictly middle, not passive. The distinction, however, cannot be
insisted upon in the present case, and therefore we cannot determine
decisively whether Cerdon was excluded by the congregation or
excluded himself.

* Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. I. is. 1-2.
* Hyginus is here called the ninth bishop, and the reading is
confirmed by a passage in Cyprian's epistle to Pompey (EA. išiū

third book of Irenaeus, although Eusebius calls Hyginus the "ninth,"
the Latin text of Irenaeus makes him the "eighth," and according to
Salmon in the Dict. of Christ. Brøg. : "The MS. evidence is
decisive that Irenaeus here [in the passage quoted above from III.
4, 3] describes Hyginus as the eighth bishop, and this agrees with
the list of Roman bishops given in the preceding chapter (Ado.
Afer. III. 3. 3), and with the description of Anicetus as the tenth
Lipsius hence infers that
bishop a couple of chapters further on.
Irenaeus drew his account of Cerdon from two sources in which
Hyginus was differently described, but this inference is very preca
rious.
In the interval between the composition of the first and third
books, Irenaeus may have been led to alter his way of counting by
investigations concerning the succession of the Roman bishops,
which he had in the meantime either made himself, or adopted from
Hegesippus. As for the numeration ‘ninth,' we do not venture to
É.". whether it indicates a list in which Peter was counted
rst bishop, or one in which Cletus and Anacletus were reckoned as
distinct." According to Eusebius' own reckoning up to the present
chapter, Hyginus was the eighth, not the ninth, from the apostles, for
in o: 5, above, he calls Telesphorus (Hyginus' predecess

seventh, in chap. 1, Alexander (the predecessor of Xystus, who pre
ceded Telesphorus) the fifth, and so on. Why, in the passage quoted
at the beginning of this chapter, he should change his reckoning,
and call Hyginus the ninth if the original list of Irenaeus from which
he drew said eighth is difficult to see.
It is possible that he made
the change under the influence of the "ninth," in the present pas
sage, which certainly stood in the original text.
It would be easier
to think this if the order in which the passages are quoted were
reversed, but it, may be that Eusebius had the present quotation in
mind when making the first, or that he went back afterward and
$orrected that to correspond.
If he ventured to change the text of
Irenaeus in that passage, he must have done it in all good faith,

and developed his doctrine, uttering shame
less blasphemies." The same Irenaeus unfolds with the greatest vigor the unfathomable
abyss of Valentinus' errors in regard to matter,
and reveals his wickedness, secret and hid
den like a serpent lurking in its nest. And
in addition to these men he says that there
was also another that lived in that age, Marcus
by name," who was remarkably skilled in magic
arts. And he describes also their unholy initia
tions and their abominable mysteries in the
following words: ""For some of them prepare a nuptial couch and perform a mystic
rite with certain forms of expression addressed
to those who are being initiated, and they say
is a spiritual marriage which is cele
that it
brated by them, after the likeness of the mar
riages above. But others lead them to water, and
while they baptize them they repeat the follow
ing words:

father of the universe, into truth, the mother of
all things, into the one that descended upon
Jesus." Others repeat Hebrew names * in order
the better to confound those who are being
initiated."

* Marcion drew this same distinction between the strictly just
God of the Old Testament and the good or merciful God of the New,

It is
noticeable that Pseudo-Tertullian (A do. Omines //aer. Chap. 6) says
that Cerdon taught two Gods, one good, the other cruel (so to m);
the good being the superior God, - the latter, the cruel one, being
the creator of the world.

* Irenaeus gives an account of Marcus and the Marcosians in
I. 13-21. He was a Gnostic of the sect of Valentinus. Jerome calls
him a Basilidian (Ep. LXXV. 3), but he was mistaken.
Hippolytus
and Epiphanius (Haer. 34) copy their accounts from Ircraus, and
probably had no direct knowledge of the works of Marcus, or of his
sect.
Clement of Alexandria, however, knew and used his writings.
It is probable that Asia Minor was the scene of his labors. He is
spoken of in the present tense by Irenaeus, and hence seems to have
been alive when he wrote; that is, in the latter part of the second
century. His additions to Valentinianism lay "... perhaps solely,
in the introduction of worthless magic rites. He sec ms to have

* On Hyginus, see the previous chapter; note 3.
14 Eusebius states, just below, that Pius held office, fifteen years,
and in his Chronicle he gives the same figure.
In that work (Ar

Pius, though the version of Jerome assigns it. to the fifth year, and
with this Eusebius agrees in his //istory, for in the previous chopter
he puts the accession of Hyginus in the first year of Antoninus Pius,
and here tells us that Hyginus held office four years. Lipsius o
signs Pius' episcopate to the years 130-154, as the earliest possible
termini; the vears 141-156 as the latest.
But since we learn from
chapter 14, below, that Polycarp was in Rome during the episcopate
of Anicetus, and from other sources (see chapter 15, note 2) that
he was martyred in Asia Minor in 155 or 156, we may assume it, as

-

15 Of Marcus we know only what Eusebius tells us here: that he
succeeded Eumenes, after the latter had held office thirteen years,
and that he continued in office ten years. If Eumenes became bishop
in 132 or 133 (see above, chap. 5, note 16), then Marcus must have
succeeded him in 145 or 146, and this agrees with the Armenian
Chron. of Eusebius, which, while it does not mention the accession
of Marcus, yet puts the accession of his successor Celadin in the
eighteenth year of Antoninus Pius, which would make the begin
ning of his own episcopate the eighth year of the same ruler. Je
rome's version of the Chron., however, puts it in the sixth year.
Little reliance is to be placed upon any of the dates of the Alexan
drian bishops during the first two centuries.

* On Eumenes, see above, chap. 5, note 14.
17 Of Celadion we know only what Eusebius tells us here, and in
chap. 19, where he gives fourteen years as the duration of his epis
copate. As mentioned in the previous note, the Armenian Chron.
of Eusebius puts his accession in the eighteenth year of Antoninus
Pius, i.e. 155 or 156, while the version of Jerome puts it in the six
teenth year.

** Anicetus, according to the Armenian Chron. of Eusebius, suc
ceeded Pius in the fifteenth year of Antoninus Pius; according to
Jerome's version, in the eighteenth .." (i.e. 155 or 156), which is
more nearly correct.
Lipsius puts his accession between 154 and

both versions of the Chron, agree, Anicetus lo. eleven years;
i.e. until 165 to 167, when he was succeeded by Soter.
Irenaeus (as
quoted by Eusebius in Bk. V. chap. 24) informs us that Polycarp
was in Rome in the time of Anicetus, and endeavored to induce him
to adopt the Quartodeciman practice of celebrating Easter; but that,
while the two remained perfectly friendly to one another, Anicetus
would not change the custom of the Roman church (sec the notes
on the chapter referred to). As stated in note 13, the Liberian and
Felician Catalogues incorrectly insert the name of Anicetus betwcen
those of Hyginus and Pius.

1". Eusebius evidently makes a mistake here. That Hegesippus
remained so long in Rome (Anicetus ruled from 154-168 (?), and
Eleutherus from 177-190) is upon the face of it very improbable.
And in this case we can see clearly how Eusebius made his mistake.
In chap. 22 he quotes a passage from Hegesippus in regard to his
stay in Rome, and it was in all probability this passage i. which
But Hegesippus says there that he
Eusebius drew his conclusion.
" remained in Rome until the time of Anicetus,' &c.
It is probable,
therefore, that he returned to the East during Anicetus' episcopacy.
He does not express himself as one who had remained in Rome until
the reign of Eleutherus; but Eusebius, from a hasty reading, might
easily i. athered that idea.
According to Hegesippus' account
in chap. 22, he must, then, have come to Rome before Anicetus, i.e.
during the reign of Pius, and this Eusebius does not here contradict,
though he is said to do so by Reading, who translates the Greek
words, on tomu no at 7 m 'Poum, "came to the city" (so, also, Closs,
Stigloher, and Cruse).
But the words properly mean "to be in
Rome," not "to come to Rome," which would require, rather, on t
ðmun ravets Tm, 'Poumw, as in § 2, above, where the words are used
of Cerdon. Jerome, to be sure (de for. o. 22), says that Hegesip
pus came to Rome in the time of Anicetus; but his account rests
solely upon Eusebius, whom he mistranslated. The tradition, there
fore, that Hegesippus came to Rome in the time of Anicetus has no
foundation; he was already there, as he himself informs us, in chap.
22, below.

Cf. the note on this passage, in chap. 22.

*" Eusebius here puts Justin in his proper place, in the time of
Antoninus Pius. The date of his birth is unknown, though it can

those days.
In the guise of a philosopher *
he preached the divine word, and contended for
the faith in his writings. He wrote also a work
against Marcion," in which he states that
the latter was alive at the time he wrote. He
speaks as follows:* "And there is a cer
tain Marcion * of Pontus," who is even now

not have been far from the beginning of the second century. He
was born in Flavia Neapolis, a Roman town built close by the ruins
of the ancient Sychem, in Samaria. He was of heathen parentage,
and received a thoroughly Greek education. He became an earnest
student of philosophy, and after turning to many different systems
in his search for truth, he was at last converted to Christianity,
where he found that for which he had been searching; and his whole
conception of Christianity shows the influence of the manner in which
he accepted it. The date of his conversion is unknown, but it seems
(from Poal. I. 1) to have taken place at least before the close of the
Barcochba war (135 A.D.). He died as a martyr, at Rome. The
date of his death is difficult to determine, but it o. place

Otto's edition of the Greek Apologists, von Engelhardt's article
in Herzog, 2d ed., Holland's article in Smith and Wace's Dict. of

the most important literature is mentioned. Upon his theology, see
especially von Engelhardt's masterly monograph, Das Christe"-

found in Purves' work on that subject (New York, 1889).

tive cloak or mantle of the Greek philosophers, which was callcd the
assium, and to which Justin refers in his Dial. c. .Trypho, §
1.
he wearing of the mantle was an advantage to the philosophers, in
asmuch as it gave them peculiar opportunities to engage in phil
osophic, discourse in the street or market, or other public |...";
which they could not otherwise so easily have enjoyed. Perhaps it
was this fact which led Justin to continue wearing the cloak, and we
see from the introduction to his Dialogue that it was the wearing of
it which was the immediate occasion of his conversation with Trypho
and his friends.
Heraclas, the friend of Origen, also continued to
wear the philosopher's cloak after his conversion, as we learn from
Bk. VI. chap. 19.

* This work against Marcion is also mentioned by Irenaeus, who
quotes from it in his Adv. Haer. IV. 16. 2 (see below, chap. 18),
and by Photius, Cod. 125. The work is lost, and we have only the
single brief fragment preserved by Irenaeus.
It is possible that it
formed a part of the larger Syntagma contra omnes Haereses,
mentioned by Justin in his Apol. I. 36 (see below), and it has been
urged in support of this possibility that Irenaeus nowhere mentions
a work of Justin's Against al! He resies, although it is highly prob
able that he made use of such a work (see Lipsius' Que'en der ält
ester, Actaergesch. and Harnack's Zur Que'ez, krit:# des Gnosti
cis/tus).
It would seem that Irenaeus is referring to this work when
he mentions the Syntagma contra Marcionem. On the other hand,
Photius mentions the work against Marcion and the one against all
heresies as two separate works. He does not seem, however, to
have had a personal knowledge of them, and is possibly only repeat
ing Eusebius (Harnack says he is certainly doing so, Urðcrlieser
ung d. griech. Apol. p. 15o; but in view of the fact that he omits
two works mentioned by Eusebius, this scems to me somewhat doubt
ful); and if this is so, no reliance is to be placed upon his report, for
it is evident that Eusebius himself knew neither of the two works,
and hence the fact that he distinguishes them has no significance.
Although, therefore, it cannot be determined whether Justin wrote
two separate works against heretics, it is quite probable that he did

t.
The conduct of Eusebius in this connection is very peculiar.
After mentioning the work against Marcion, he at once gives a quo
tation in such a way as to convey the impression that the quotation
is taken from this work, but it is really taken from the first
Aology.
This makes it very probable that he had not seen this work against
Marcion, a conclusion which is confirmed by its omission from the
list of Justin's writings given in chap. 18.
It is claimed by many
that Eusebius practices a little deception here, wishing to convey the
impression that he knew a book which he did not know. This is not
in accord with his usual conduct (as he seldom hesitates to confess
his ignorance of any matter), and his general character for candor
and honesty must be taken into account in deciding the case. He
does not state directly that the quotation is taken from the work
against Marcion, and it is possible that the seeming reference of it
to that source was an oversight on his part.
But it must be ac
knowledged, if that be the case, that he was vely careless in making
the quotation.

* Justin, Apol. I. 26.

24 Marcion cannot be called a Gnostic in the strict sense of the
term. He was rather an anti-Jewish reformer. He had much in
common with the Gnostics, but laid stress upon belief rather than
upon knowledge. He developed no complete system as did the
other Gnostics, but aimed at a practical reform in the interest of an
extreme and perverted Paulinism, considering Paul the only true
apostle and rejecting the others as Judaizing teachers. He out the

still teaching his followers to think that there is
some other God greater than the creator. And
by the aid of the demons" he has persuaded
many of every race of men" to utter blasphemy,
and to deny that the maker of this universe is
the father of Christ, and to confess that some
other, greater than he, was the creator." And
all who followed them are, as we have said,"
called Christians, just as the name of philosophy
is given to philosophers, although they

this he adds : * "And we have also written

Testament and all of the New except a mutilated Gospel of Luke
and the Epistles of Paul, and denying the identity of the God of the
Old Testament with the Supreme God, and the identity of Jesus
with the promised Jewish K.". He magnified the mercy of
God in redemption at the expense of creation, which he attributed
to the demiurge, and in which he saw nothing good. He was an
extreme anti-metaphysician, and the first Biblical critic. He was
born in Pontus, was the son of a bishop, went to Rome about 135
A.D., and endeavored to carry out his reforms there, but was unsuc
cessful, and very soon broke with the Church. He traveled exten
sively and disseminated his doctrines very widely. The sect existed
well on into the Middle Ages, and some of his opinions have never
been completely eradicated. In Rome the Gnostic Cerdon exercised
great influence over him, and to him are doubtless due many of
Marcion's Gnostic traits. The dualism which he held in common
with the Gnostics arose rather from practical than speculative con
siderations; but his followers in the |. and fifth centuries, when
they had lost his practical religious spirit and yet retained his dual:
ism, passed over quite naturally into Manicheeism. He was attacked
by justin, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and all the anti-heretical writers of
the early Church, and was considered one of the most dangerous of
heretics. A complete monograph upon Marcion is still a desidera
tum, but he is discussed in all the general accounts of Gnosticism;
seeo the brief but excellent account by Harnack, Dogmen
gesch ichte, I. 197-214.

** Pontus was a province in Northeastern Asia Minor, bordering

upon the Black Sea.

* Justin here agrees with Eusebius in his transcendental theory
of heresy, looking upon it not as a natural growth from within, but
as an inio upon the Church from without, through the agency
of demons.
Indeed, this was the prevailing notion of the early
Church.

27 The extent of Marcion's influence referred to here is very
significant.
Gnosticism was not intended for common people, and

Photius (Cod. 125), but he evidently had never seen it, and is sim.

Verus, which Marcus had formerly borne. He is ther fore c on

cidental, as it does not belong there, but was appended to the edict
of Hadrian by some late copyist. The edict is now almost univer
sally acknowledged to be a forgery; compare Overbeck, Straßen zur
Gesch. der aft. Kirche, p. 93 sqq. Wieseler contends for its genu
ineness, but no good critic isol. him.

2 Euscbius gives this as an edict of Antoninus Pius, and yet its
inscription assigns it to Marcus Aurelius. Overbeck concludes that
Eusebius was led by internal evidence to assign the rescript to An
toninus Pius, but that he did not venture to change the inscription
of the original which lay before him. This seems the only possible
explanation, and as Eusebius at any rate was badly confused in re
gard to the names of the Antonines, the glaring o". may

where this edict is appended to the first Apology, the superscription
and text are quite different from the form given by Eusebius. The
rescript is in o assigned there by its superscription to Antoninus
Pius, instead of to Marcus Aurelius.
But if that was its original
form, we cannot understand the later change to Marcus Aurelius,
for certainly his authorship is precluded on the very face of the
documcnt; is: it is easier to see how it could have been later as
signed to Antoninus Pius under the influence of Eusebius' direct
statement. We have no knowledge of the original Latin of this pre
tended edict.
Rufinus evidently did not know it, for he translates
the document from the Greek of Eusebius. The text of the edict as
given by Eusebius differs considerably at many points from the text
found in the MSS. of Justin, and the variations are such as can hardly
be explained as due merely to copyists' errors or alterations. At the
same time the two texts are plainly not independent of each other,
and cannot be looked upon as independent translations of one Latin
original. We may perhaps suppose that one text represents the
original translation, the other a revision of it. Whether the revision
was made by a comparison with the original, and thus more accu
rately represents it, we cannot tell.
If, then, one is a revision of the
other, the form given in the MSS. of Justin is evidently the later,
for its statements in more places than one are an improvement upon
those of the other text in point of clearness and decisiveness. More
over, as remarked just above, the ascription of the edict to Anto
minus Pius must be later than its ascription to Marcus Aurelius.

* Numerous earthquakes took place in Asia Minor and in Rhodes
during the reign of Antoninus Pius, and these, as well as famines
and other, occurrences of the kind which were uncomfortably fre

But in regard to these persons, many of the governors
of the provinces wrote also to our most divine

not trouble these people unless it should appear
that they were attempting something affecting the
Roman government."

Overbeck follows Heinichen

which the Greek will properly admit, and I have therefore felt com

from Melito's .4/o/ogy, quoted below, in chap. 26, where Melito re

other passage, he would undoubtedly have quoted it.
But accord
ing to Melito, the edicts of Antoninus were to prevent any new
methods of procedure against the Christians, i.e. tumultuous pro
ceedings in opposition to the custom established by Trajan. The
colicts of which he speaks were intended, then, to perpetuate the
principles of Trajan, which had been, since his time, the silent law
of the empire upon the subject. The edicts cannot have been edicts
of toleration (even Melito himself does no regard them so), but
edicts against illegal, tumultuous proceedings, and the accusations of
informers, and therefore quite in the spirit of Trajan.
But as the
significance of Trajan's rescript was critirely misunderstood in the

IRENAEUS ON POLYCARP.

CHAPTER XIV.

The Circumstances related of Polycarp, a Friend'
of the Apostles.

l

At this time, while Anicetus was at the
head of the church of Rome, Irenaeus
relates that Polycarp, who was still alive, was
at Rome," and that he had a conference with
Anicetus on a question
the
day of the paschal feast." And the same
writer gives another account of Polycarp
which I feel constrained to add to that which has
been already related in regard to him. The ac
count is taken from the third book of Irenaeus'
work Against Heresies, and is as follows: "
"But Polycarp" also was not only instructed

concerning

common opinion that the attitude of the State toward the Church
was at bottom friendly to Christianity, and therefore all edicts for.
bidding the introduction of new methods were regarded as favorable
edicts, as in the present case by Eusebius.
Again, had Melito
known of such a favorable edict as this of Antoninus, he would cer
tainly have called special and particular attention to it.
Melito's
testimony, therefore, insteal of being in favor of the genuineness of
this edict, is really against it.

* O.) Anicetus, see above, chap. 11, note 18.

He was bishop prob

ably from 154 to 165 A.D.

* Yevgoal of 'Poons.

It is quite commonly said that Polycarp
came to Rome during the episcopate of Anicetus; but our authori
ties say only that he was in Rome at that time, and do not specify
the date at which he arrived there.
Neither these words, nor the
words of Irenaeus in § 5 below (on 16 numa as Tim 'Poum), are to be
translated "came to Rome," as is often done (e.g. by Cruse, by
Roberts and Rambaut, in their translation of Irenaeus, and by Salmon,
in the Dict. of Christ. Biog.), but "was at Rome" (as Closs,
Stigloher, Lightfoot, &c., correctly render the words).
Inasmuch
as Polycarp suffered martyrdom in 155 or 156 A.D. (see below, chap.
15, note 2), he must have left Rome soon after Anticetus' accession
(which took place probably in 154); and though of course he may
have come thither sometime before that event, still the fact that his
stay there is connected with Anicetus' episcopate, and his alone, im
plies that he went thither either immediately after, or shortly before
Anicetus became bishop.

* O., the paschal controversies of the early Church, see below,
Hk. V. chap. 23, note 1. We learn from
V. chap. 24, that
though Polycarp and Anicetus did not reach an agreement on the
subject, they nevertheless remained good friends, and that Polycarp
celebrated the eucharist in Rome at i. request of Anicetus.

* Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. III. 3. 4.

Eusebius takes his account of Polycarp solely from Irenaeus,
and from the epistle of the church of Šo. given in the next
chapter. He is mentioned by Irenaeus again in his Ado. Harr. V.
33. 4. (quoted by Eusebius in Bk. III. chap. 39), and in his epistle
to Florinus and to Victor.
From the epistle to Florinus (quoted
below in Bk. V. chap. 2d), where quite an account of Polycarp is
given, we learn that the latter was Irenaeus' teacher.
e vv.as one
the most celebrated men of the time, not because of his ability or
scholarship, but because he had been a personal sriend of some
of the disciples of the Lord, and lived to a great age, when few
if any were still alive that had known the first generation of Chris
tions. He suffered martyrdom about 155 A.D. (see below, chap. 15,
note 2); and as he was at least eighty-six years old at the time of his
death (see the next chap., § 20), he must have been born as early as
70 A.D. He was a personal disciple of John the apostlc, as we learn
from Irenaeus' epistle to Florinus, and was acquainted also with
others that had seen the Lord.
That he was at the head of the
church of Smyrna cannot be doubted (cf. Ignatius' epistle to him),
but Irenaeus' statement that he was appointed bishop of Smyrna by
apostles is probably to be looked upon as a combination of his own.
He reasoned that bishops were the successors of the apostles; Poly
carp was a bishop, and lived in the time of the apostles; and there
fore he must have been appointed by them. The only known
writing of Polyoarp's is his epistle to the Philippians, which is still
ext unt (see below, note
His character is plainly revealed
in that epistle as well as in the accounts given us by Irenaeus and
by the church of Smyrna in their epistle. He was a devoutly pious
and simple-minded Christian, burning with intense personal .. sor
his Master, and yet not at all fanatical like his contemporary Igna
tius. The instances related in this chapter show his intense horror
of heretics, of those whom he believed to be corrupting the doctrine
of Christ, and yet he does not seem to have had the taste or talent to
refute their errors. He simply wished to avoid them as instruments
of Satan. He was pre-eminently a man that lived in the past.
His

by apostles, and acquainted with many that
had seen Christ, but was also appointed by
apostles in Asia bishop of the church of
Smyrna." We too saw him in our early
youth ; for he lived a long time, and died,
when a very old man, a glorious and most il
lustrious martyr's death, having always taught
the things which he had learned from the apos
tles, which the Church also hands down,
and which alone are true." To these things
all the Asiatic churches testify, as do also
those who, down to the present time, have suc
ceeded Polycarp," who was a much more trust
worthy and certain witness of the truth than
Valentinus and Marcion and the rest of the here
tics." He also was in Rome in the time of
Anicetus" and caused many to turn away from
the above-mentioned heretics to the Church of
God, proclaiming that he had received from
the apostles this one and only system of truth
which has been transmitted by the Church.
And there are those that heard from him
that John, the disciple of the Lord, going
to bathe in Ephesus and seeing Cerinthus with
in, ran out of the bath-house without bathing,
crying, ‘Let us flee, lest even the bath fall,
because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth,
And Polycarp himself, when
is within.'"
Marcion once met him " and said, "Know
est" thou us?' replied, ‘I know the first born
of Satan."
Such caution did the apostles and
their disciples exercise that they might not even
converse with any of those who perverted the
truth ; as Paul also said, ‘A man that is a
heretic, after the first and second admonition,

century was as a channel of apostolic tradition. He does not com
pare with Ignatius for vigor and originality of thought, and }. he
was one of the most deeply venerated characters of the early Church,
his noble piety, his relation to John and other disciples of the Lord,
and finally his glorious martyrdom, contributing to make him such:

13 Marcion came to Rome about 135 A.D., but how long he re
mained there we do not know.
Polycarp's words show the great
abhorrence in which he was held by the Church. He was considered
by many the most dangerous of all the heretics, for he propagated
his errors and secured many followers among all classes.
Marcion's
conduct in this case is very significant when compared with that of
the Gnostics. He tried everywhere to gain support and to make
friends with the Church, that }. might introduce his reforms within
it; while the genuine Gnostics, on the contrary, held themselves
aloof from the Church, in pride and in a feelingo Poly
carp in his Epistle to the Philippians, chap. 7, shows the same
severity toward false teachers, and even uses the same expression,

is very difficult to determine.

* Polycarp's martyrdom occurred in Smyrna, not during the
reign of Marcus Aurelius, as Eusebius says, but during the reign of
Antoninus Pius; between 154 and 156 (probably in 155). This has

Put the
Chron. of Eusebius seems to put the martyrdom in the seventh year
of Marcus Aurelius (166-167 A.D.), and this is the date given by
Jerome and others, who based their chronology upon Eusebius, and
was commonly accepted until Waddington proved it false.
Light
foot, however, shows that Eusebius did not mean to assign Poly
carp's death to the seventh year of Marcus Aurelius, but that he
meant only to place it in the reign of that emperor, and did not pre
tend to fix the year. How he made the mistake of assigning it to

life by martyrdom.
But I consider it most im
portant that his death, a written account of
which is still extant, should be recorded in
this history.
There is a letter, written in
the name of the church over which he him
self presided," to the parishes in Pontus," which
relates the events that befell him, in the fol
lowing words: "The church of God which
dwelleth at Smyrna to the church of God
which dwelleth in Philomelium," and to all the
parishes of the holy catholic Church" in every
place; mercy and peace and love from God the
Father and our Lord Jesus Christ be multiplied.
We write' unto you, brethren, an account of
what happened to those that suffered martyrdom
and to the blessed Polycarp, who put an end
to the persecution, having, as it were, sealed it

the wrong emperor we do not know, but knowing Eusebius' common
confusion of the various emperors that bore the name of Antonine,
we are not surprised at his error at this point.
For the best and
most recent discussion of this whole subject, see Lightfoot's Agora
to us, I. p. 629 sq.
Since Waddington published his researches,
Wieseler (in his Christenver/o/gungen, 1878, p. 34-87) and Keim
(<1 us dean Urchristenth it me, 1878, p. 92-133) have ventured to
dispute his conclusions and to advocate the old date (167), but their
arguments are worthless, and have been completely refuted by
Lightfoot § p. 655 sq.).

* I.e. the church of Smyrna.

This letter (the greater part of
which Eusebius gives in this chapter) is still extant in four Greek
MSS., and also in a
r Latin version which is preserved in
numerous MSS. The letter has been published a number of times,
most recently by Zahn (in Gebhardt, Harmack, and Zahn's Patrum
4A. of era, II. p. 132 sq.), and by Lightfoot (in his Apostolic
Fathers, Part I'. St. Agnator's and St. Polycará, p. 947 sq.).
Lightfoot gives the Greek text with full notes and an English trans
lation, and to his edition the reader is referred for fuller particulars
on the whole subject.
* . Pontus was the northeast province of Asia Minor, bordering
on the Black Sea. What led so. to suppose that this epistle
was addressed to the church in Pontus, we do not know. The letter
is addressed to the church in Philomalium, and that city was not in
Pontus (according to Lightfoot, ifid. II. p. 948).
Walesius sug
gests that we should read mavta rām or instead of IIdvtov, but the
latter reading is confirmed both by Rufinus and by the Syriac as
well as by all the Greek MSS. I am inclined to . that Euse
bius may have read hastily and erroneously in the heading of the
letter Ilovtov instead of Távra Torov, and, not knowing that Philo
melium was not in Pontus, never thought that his reading was incor
rect.
Such careless mistakes are by no means uncommon, even in
these days, and, having once written Pontus, it is easy enough to
suppose that nothing would occur to call his attention to his mis
take, and of course no copyist would think of making a correction.

* Philomelium, according to Lightfoot (ibid, p. 947), was an im

portant city in Phrygia Paroreios, not far from Pisidian Antioch.
* Tims & Yi as katoa, kos é o KA mortas. The phrase "Catholic Church."
occurs first in Ignatius' EA. at Smyr., ... 8, and there the word
"catholic " evidently has the common and early meaning, "univer
sal " (see Lightfoot's /gnatoes, I. p. 398 sqq.).
In later usage (so in
Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and the Muratorian Fragment)
it has the meaning "orthodox," as opposed to heretical and schis
matical bodics. In the present cpistle it occurs four times (§§ 3, 15,
39, below, and in a passage not quoted in this chapter), and at least
the first three times with the later meaning, and consequently, in
all probability, it has the same meaning the fourth time also.
(Light
foot, it is true, contends that it has the earlier meaning, "universal,"
in the first, second and fourth cases; but in at least the first two that
sense of the word produces most decided tautology, and is therefore
to be rejected.) The occurrence of the word in the later sense has
caused some critics to deny the genuineness of the epistle; but its
genuineness is too well established to admit of doubt, and it must be
granted that it is by no means impossible that a word which was
used at the end of the second century (in Alexandria, in Rome,
and in Carthage) with a certain ineaning may have been employed
in the same sense a generation earlier. On the other hand it is pos
sible, as suggested by some, that the word "Catholic " itself is an
interpolation; for it is just such a word that would most easily slip
into a document, through the inadvertency of copyists, at a later
time, when the phrase "Catholic Church" had become current.
Lightfoot (of. p. 605 sq.) maintains the genuineness of the word
(taking it in its carlier sense) in all but the third instance, where he
substitutes a yi as upon what seem to me insufficient grounds.

ypg lauer, the epistolary adrist, rescring, not to another epis
tle, but to the one which follows, the writer putting himself in
thought in the position of those who are reading the letter. See
Lightfoot's note on Gal. vi. 11, in his Commentary on that epistle.

THE MARTYRDOM

OF POLYCARP.

by his martyrdom."
After these words, be
fore giving the account of Polycarp, they
record the events which befell the rest of the
martyrs, and describe the great firmness which
they exhibited in the midst of their pains.
For
they say that the bystanders were struck with
amazement when they saw them lacerated with
scourges even to the innermost veins and arter
ies, so that the hidden inward parts of the body,
both their bowels and their members, were ex
posed to view ; and then laid upon sea-shells and
certain pointed spits, and subjected to every
species of punishment and of torture, and
finally thrown as food to wild beasts. And
they record that the most noble Germani
cus" especially distinguished himself, overcoming
by the grace of God the fear of bodily death im
planted by nature. When indeed the proconsul"
wished to persuade him, and urged his youth,
and besought him, as he was very young and
vigorous, to take compassion on himself, he did
not hesitate, but eagerly lured the beast toward
himself, all but compelling and irritating him, in
order that he might the sooner be freed
from their unrighteous and lawless life. Af.
ter his glorious death the whole multitude,
marveling at the bravery of the God-beloved
martyr and at the fortitude of the whole race of
Christians, began to cry out suddenly, "Away
with the atheists; "let Polycarp be sought."
And when a very great tumult arose in con
sequence of the cries, a certain Phrygian,
Quintus" by name, who was newly come from
Phrygia, seeing the beasts and the additional
tortures, was smitten with cowardice and
gave up the attainment of salvation.
But
the above-mentioned epistle shows that he,
too hastily and without proper discretion, had
rushed forward with others to the tribunal, but
when seized had furnished a clear proof to
all, that it is not right for such persons rashly
and recklessly to expose themselves to danger.
Thus did matters turn out in connection with

them.

But the most admirable Polycarp, when
he first heard of these things, continued
undisturbed, preserved a quiet and unshaken
mind, and determined to remain in the city.
But being persuaded by his friends who en
treated and exhorted him to retire secretly,

* Of Germanicus we know only what is told us in this epistle.
* This proconsul was Statius Quadratus, as we are told in the
latter part of this epistle, in a passage which Eusebius does not
quote. Upon his dates, see the discussions of the date of Polycarp's
martyrdom mentioned in note 2, above.

* Compare Justin Martyr's Apol.
&c.; and see chap. 7, note 20, above.
... " Of Quintus we know, only what is told us in this epistle.
It is
significant that he was a Phrygian, for the Phrygians were proverbi
ally excitable and fanatical, and it was among them that Montanism
took its rise.
The conduct of Polycarp, who avoided death as long
as he could without dishonor, was in great contrast to this; and it
is noticeable that the Smyrnaeans condemn Quintus' hasty and ill
considered action, and that Eusebius echoes their judgment (see
above, p. 8)

he went out to a farm not far distant from the
city and abode there with a few companions,

the Lord in prayer, beseeching and implor
ing, and asking peace for the churches through

his custom.
And three days before his
arrest, while he was praying, he saw in a
vision at night the pillow under his head sud
denly seized by fire and consumed ; and upon
this awakening he immediately interpreted the
vision to those that were present, almost fore
telling that which was about to happen, and
declaring plainly to those that were with him
that it would be necessary for him for Christ's
sake to die by fire.

Then, as those who were seeking him
pushed the search with vigor, they say that
he was again constrained by the solicitude and
love of the brethren to go to another farm.
Thither his pursuers came after no long time, and
seized two of the servants there, and tortured one
of them for the purpose of learning from
him Polycarp's hiding-place. And coming
late in the evening, they found him lying
in an upper room, whence he might have gone
to another house, but he would not, saying,
"The will of God be done." And when
he learned that they were present, as the
account says, he went down and spoke to them
with a very cheerful and gentle countenance, so
that those who did not already know the man
thought that they beheld a miracle when they ob
served his advanced age and the gravity and
firmness of his bearing, and they marveled that
so much effort should be made to capture a
man like him.

But he did not hesitate, but immediately
gave orders that a table should be spread
for them. Then he invited them to partake of
a bounteous meal, and asked of them one hour
that he might pray undisturbed. And when they
had given permission, he stood up and prayed,
being full of the grace of the Lord, so that
those who were present and heard him praying
were amazed, and many of them now repented
that such a venerable and godly old man was
about to be put to death.
In addition to
these things the narrative concerning him
contains the following account: "But when at
length he had brought his prayer to an end, after
remembering all that had ever come into contact
with him, small and great, famous and obscure,
and the whole catholic Church throughout the
world, the hour of departure being come, they put
him upon an ass and brought him to the city,
it being a great Sabbath." And he was met by

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EU SEBIUS.

Herod," the captain of police," and by his
father Nicetes, who took him into their carriage,
and sitting beside him endeavored to persuade
him, saying, ‘For what harm is there in saying,
Lord Caesar, and sacrificing and saving your
life?' He at first did not answer; but when
they persisted, he said, ‘I am not going to
do what you advise me.' And when they failed to
persuade him, they uttered dreadful words, and
thrust him down with violence, so that as he
descended from the carriage he lacerated his
shin.
But without turning round, he went on
his way promptly and rapidly, as if nothing had
happened to him, and was taken to the
stadium.
But there was such a tumult in
the stadium that not many heard a voice
from heaven, which came to Polycarp as he was
entering the place: ‘Be strong, Polycarp, and
play the man.'" And no one saw the speaker,
but many of our people heard the voice.
18 And when he was led forward, there was a
great tumult, as they heard that Polycarp
was taken.
Finally, when he came up, the pro
consul asked if he were Polycarp. And when he
confessed that he was, he endeavored to per
suade him to deny, saying, ‘Have regard for
thine age,' and other like things, which it is
their custom to say: "Swear by the genius
of Caesar;" repent and say, Away with the
Atheists.'
But Polycarp, looking with dignified
countenance upon the whole crowd that was
gathered in the stadium, waved his hand to them,
and groaned, and raising his eyes toward

when the magistrate pressed him, and said,
"Swear, and I will release thee; revile Christ,'
Polycarp said, ‘Fourscore and six years" have I
been serving him, and he hath done me no
wrong; how then can I blaspheme my king who

saved me?'

"But when he again persisted, and said,
"Swear by the genius of Caesar,' Polycarp
replied, "If thou vainly supposest that I will

might be meant, - that is, any Sabbath which coincided with a fes

Lightfoot gives
strong reasons for assuming that the traditional day of Polycarp's
death (Feb. 23) is correct, and that the Sabbath referred to here was
a great Sabbath because it coincided with the Feast of Purim (see
Lightfoot, food. I. p. 660 sqq. and 690 sqq.).

but, on the contrary, the proconsul was amazed,
and sent his herald to proclaim three times in
the midst of the stadium : ‘Polycarp hath
confessed that he is a Christian.' And when
this was proclaimed by the herald, the whole
multitude, both of Gentiles and of Jews," who
dwelt in Smyrna, cried out with ungovernable
wrath and with a great shout, ‘This is the teacher
of Asia, the father of the Christians, the over

was necessary that the vision should be ful
filled which had been shown him concerning his
pillow, when he saw it burning while he was
praying, and turned and said prophetically to
the faithful that were with him, ‘I must
needs be burned alive.'
These things were
done with great speed, - more quickly than
they were said, - the crowds immediately col
lecting from the workshops and baths timber
and fagots, the Jews being especially zeal
ous in the work, as is their wont. But when
the pile was ready, taking off all his upper
garments, and loosing his girdle, he attempted
also to remove his shoes, although he had never
before done this, because of the effort which each
of the faithful always made to touch his skin
first ; for he had been treated with all honor on
account of his virtuous life even before his
gray hairs came.
Forthwith then the mate
rials prepared for the pile were placed about
him ; and as they were also about to nail him to
the stake," he said, ‘Leave me thus ;
for he
who hath given me strength to endure the fire,
will also grant me strength to remain in the fire
unmoved without being secured by you with
nails.' So they did not nail him, but bound
him. And he, with his hands behind him,
and bound like a noble ram taken from a
great flock, an acceptable burnt-offering unto

that I might receive a portion in the number of
the martyrs, in the cup of Christ, unto resurrec

in the immortality of the Holy Spirit.
34 Among these may I be received before
thee this day, in a rich and acceptable sac

and as a great flame blazed out, we, to whom it
was given to see, saw a wonder, and we were
preserved that we might relate what hap
pened to the others. For the fire presented
the appearance of a vault, like the sail of a
vessel filled by the wind, and made a wall about
the body of the martyr," and it was in the midst
not like flesh burning, but like gold and silver
refined in a furnace.
For we perceived such a
fragrant odor, as of the fumes of frankin
cense or of some other precious spices. So
at length the lawless men, when they saw
that the body could not be consumed by the
fire, commanded an executioner" to ap

* Before the words "a quantity of |..." are sound in all the
Greek MSS. of the epistle the words repto repā kai, "a dove and."
It seems probable that these words of not belong to the original
text, but that they were, as many critics believe, an unintentional
corruption of some other phrase, or that they were, as Lightfoot
thinks, a deliberate into by a late editor (see Lightfoot, II.
974 f. and I. 627 ff.). No argument, therefore, against the honesty
of Eusebius can be drawn from his omission of the words.

* See above, note 6.

That the word kato&txis is used here in
the later sense of "orthodox," as opposed to herotical, and schismat
ical bodies, can be questioned by no one.
Lightfoot, however, leads
at this point àytas instead of xàboxerns in his edition of the epistle.
It is true that he has some MS. support, but the MSS. and versions
of Eusebius are unanimous in favor of the latter word, and I ight
foot's grounds for making the change seem to be quite insufficient.
If any change is to be made, the word should be dropped out en
tirely, as suggested by the note already referred to.
* All, or nearly all, the MSS. of Eusebius read Ad Axms, and
that reading is adopted by Stephanus, Walesius (in his, text), Schweg
ler, Laemmer, Heinichen, and Cruse. On the other hand, the MSS.
of the epistle itself all support the form A^*n; (or 'AAxis, Eaxos,

not to give up his body, "lest,' it was said, "they
should abandon the crucified One and begin to
worship this man." They said these things at
the suggestion and impulse of the Jews, who also
watched as we were about to take it from the
fire, not knowing that we shall never be able
either to forsake Christ, who suffered for the
salvation of the whole world of those that
are saved, or to worship any other.
For
we worship him who is the Son of God, but
the martyrs, as disciples and imitators of the
Lord, we love as they deserve on account of
their matchless affection for their own king and
teacher. May we also be made partakers
and fellow-disciples with them. The cen
turion, therefore, when he saw the conten
tiousness exhibited by the Jews, placed him in
the midst and burned him, as was their custom.
And so we afterwards gathered up his bones,
which were more valuable than precious stones
and more to be esteemed than gold, and
laid them in a suitable place.

Lord will permit us to come together as we
are able, in gladness and joy to celebrate the
birthday of his martyrdom," for the commemo
ration of those who have already fought and for
the training and preparation of those who
shall hereafter do the same.
Such are the
events that befell the blessed Polycarp, who
suffered martyrdom in Smyrna with the eleven"

while Alce, though rare, is a good Greek name, and is once con

Ignatius, ad Smyr. 13, and ad Polyc. VIII., that Alce was a well
known Christian in Smyrna at the time Ignatius wrote his epistles.
The use of the name at this point shows that its possessor was or
had been a prominent character in the church of Smyrna, and the
identification of the two seems to me beyond all reasonable doubt
(see, also, Lightfoot, I, 353; II. 325 and 978). That Eusebius,
however, wrote Alce is not so certain.
In fact, in view of the exter
nal testimony, it might be regarded as quite as likely that he, by a
mistake, wrote Dalce, as that some copyist afterwards committed
the error.
Still, the name Alce must have been to Eusebius, with
his remarkable memory, familiar from Ignatius' epistles, and hence
his mistaking it for another word seems a little strange.
But
whether Eusebius himself wrote Dalce or Alce, believing the latter
to be the correct form, the form which he should have written, I
have ventured to adopt it in my translation.

But it does not show that the

casily conclude from the Christians' tender care of and reverence for
the martyrs' relics that they also worshiped them.

celebration of the day of a martyr's death, a practice which early
became so common in the Church. The next reference to the cus

"suffered martyrdom with the eleven from Philadelphia."

Of such an end was the admirable and

that Eusebius agreed with his original in making Polycarp the

know. They cannot have been persons of prominence, or Polycarp's
martyrdom would not so completely have overshadowed theirs.

* Ypab m. These other accounts were not given in the epistle of
the Smyrnaeans, but were doubtless appended to that epistle in the
MS. which Eusebius used. The accounts referred to are not found
in any of our MSS. of the epistle, but there is published in Ruinart's
Acta Martyrum Sincera, p. 188 sq., a narrative in Latin of the
martyrdom of a certain Pionius and of a certain Marcionist Metro
dorus, as well as of others, which appears to be substantially the
same as the document which Eusebius knew in the original Greek,
and which he refers to here. The account bears all the marks of
genuineness, and may be regarded as trustworthy, at least in the
main points.
But Eusebius has fallen into a serious chronological
blunder in making these other martyrs contemporaries of Polycarp.
We learn from a notice in the document given by Ruinart that Pio
nius, Metrodorus, and the others were put to death during the per
secution of Decius, in 250 A.D., and this date is confirmed by exter
nal evidence. The document which Eusebius used may not have
contained the distinct chronological notice which is now found in it,
or Eusebius may have overlooked it, and finding the narrative given
in his M.S. in close connection with the account of Polycarp's mar
tyrdom, he may have jumped hastily to the conclusion that both ac

ABOUT this time "Justin, who was men

with divine martyrdom," in consequence of a plot

But in 1881. Aube published in the
Rerue Archaeologique (Dec., p. 348 sq.) a shorter form of the Acts
of these martyrs. §, he had discovered in a Greek MS. in the
Paris Library. There is no reason to doubt that these Acts are genu
ine and, in the main, quite trustworthy. The longer Acts assign the
death of these martyrs to the reign of Decius, and they have alway
been regarded as suffering during that persecution. Aube, in .
lishing . newly discovered document, still accepted the old date;
but Zahn, upon the basis of the document which he had also seen,
remarked in his Tatian's Diatessaron (p. 279) that Eusebius was
correct in assigning these martyrdoms to the reign of Marcus Aure
lius, and Lightfoot (I. p. 625) stated his belief that they are to be
assigned either to that reign or to the reign of Septimius Severus.
In 1888 Harnack (Terte und. Unters. III. 4) published a new edi
tion of the Acts from the same MS. which Aubé had used, accompa
nying the text with valuable notes and with a careful discussion of
the age of the document. He has proved beyond all doubt that these
martyrs were put to death during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, and
that the shorter document which we have contains a genuine account
related by an eye-witness. These are evidently the Acts which Eu

But in the shorter account they are
simply Christians, and Papylus informs the judge that he is a citizen
of Thyatira.

Eusebius apparently did not include the account of these martyrs
in his collection of Ancient Martyrdoms, and Harnack concludes
the fanaticism of Agathonice, who rashly and ...; rushes to
from that that he sound in it something that did not please him, viz.
martyrdom, and the approval of her conduct expressed by the author
of the Acts. We are reminded of the conduct of the Phrygian Quin
tus mentioned in the epistle of the Smyrnaeans but in that epistle
such conduct is condemned.

1 That is, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Ve
rus, 161-169 A.D., Inasmuch as Eusebius is certainly in error in
ascribing the death of Polycarp, recorded in the previous chapter, to
the reign of Marcus Aurelius (see note 2 on that chapter), the fact
that he here connects Justin's death with that reign furnishes no evi
dence that it really occurred then; but we have other good reasons
for supposing that it did (see below, note 4).

3 Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, whom he mentioned at the
close of chap. 14, and the events of whose reign he is now ostensibly
recording. But in regard to this supposed second apology addressed
to them, see chap. 18, note 3.

* That Justin died a martyr's death is the universal tradition of
antiquity, which is crystallized in his name.
Irenaeus (Adv. Haer.
I. 28. 1) is the first to mention it, but does so casually, as a fact
well known. The only account of his martyrdom which we have is
contained in the Acta Martyril 9 ustini Philosophi (Galland. I.
797 sq.), which, although belonging to a later age (probably the
third century), yet bear every evidence of containing a compara
tively truthful account of Justin's death. . According to these Acts,
Justín, with six companions, was brought before Rusticus, prefect
of Rome, and by him condemned to death, upon his refusal to sacri
fice to the gods. The date of his martyrdom is very difficult to de
termine. . There are two lines of tradition, one of which puts his
death under Antoninus Pius, the other under Marcus Aurelius. The
latter has the most in its favor; and if we are to accept the report of
the Acta 7ustini (which can be doubted least of all at this point),
his death took place under Rusticus, who, as we know, became pre
soot of Rome in 163. Upon the date of Justin's death, see especially
Hollani, in Smith and Wace, III. p. 562 sq.

us by Justin and Tatian, and they paint his character in the blackest
colors.

won by his martyrdom the prize of victory, dying
in behalf of the truth which he preached.
And he himself, a man most learned in the
truth, in his Apology already referred to"
clearly predicts how this was about to happen
to him, although it had not yet occurred.
His words are as follows:' "I, too," there

not worthy to be called a philosopher who pub

Doing this he errs greatly.
For if he assails
us without having read the teachings of
Christ, he is thoroughly depraved, and is much
worse than the illiterate, who often guard against
discussing and bearing false witness about mat
ters which they do not understand. And if he
has read them and does not understand the
majesty that is in them, or, understanding it,
does these things in order that he may not be
suspected of being an adherent, he is far more
base and totally depraved, being enslaved to
vulgar applause and irrational fear.

stated, and the contrary seems rather to be implied (see note 13,

the false impression that he quotes from the second apology, whereas
he really quotes from what was to him the first, as can be seen from
chap. 17.

he refers to this same apology as lie first), and it

ored before the truth" (from Plato's Republic, Bk. X.).
It is hard
to say why Eusebius, should have onlitted it.
Perhaps it was so
well known that he did not think it necessary to repeat it, taking for
granted that the connection would suggest the same to every reader,
or it is possible that the omission is the fault of a copyist, not of
Eusebius himself.

* On Tatian and his writings, see below, chap. 29.
Eusebius has been accused by Dembowski, Zahn, Harnack, and
others of practicing deception at this point.
The passage from
Tatian's Oratio ad Graecos, which Eusebius appeals to for testi
mony in regard to Justin's death, and which he quotes just below, is
not given by him exactly as it stands in the extant text of the Oratio.
In the latter we read, "He who taught that death should be despised
was himself so greatly in fear of it, that he endeavored to inflict death
as if it were an evil upon Justin, and indeed on one also, because
when preaching he had proved that the philosophers were gluttons
and impostors." The difference between the two texts consists in
the substitution of the word weya Ao for the words kai out dos; and
it is claimed that this alteration was intentionally made by Eusebius.
As the text stands in Tatian, the passage is far from proving that
Justin's death was caused by the machinations of Crescens, for
Tatian puts himself, on a level with Justin as the object of these
machinations, and of course since they did not succeed in his case,
there is no reason to suppose that they succeeded in Justin's case.
It is claimed, therefore, that Justin, realizing this, struck out the
kai éue tos in order to permit the reader to gather from the passage
that Tatian meant to imply that the plots of Crescens were success

however, it may be well to realize exactly j. is involved in it.
The change does not consist merely in the omission of the words
kai čue tos, but in the substitution for them of the word ueyāAw.
It
cannot, therefore, be said that Eusebius only omitted some words,
satisfying his conscience that there was no great harm in that: who
ever made the change, if he did it intentionally, directly falsified the
text, and substituted the other word for the sake of covering up his
alteration; that is, he committed an act of deceit of the worst kind,
and deliberately took steps to conceal his act. Certainly such con
duct is not in accord with Eusebius' general character, so far as we
can ascertain it from his writings.
Even Zahn and Harnack, who
accuse him of intentional deception here, yet speak of his general
conscientiousness, and treat this alteration as one which Eusebius
allowed himself to make while, at the same time, his "conscientious
ness did not permit him even this time to change truth completely
into untruth."
But if he could allow himself to make so deliberate
an alteration, and then cover the change by inserting another word,
there is little cause to speak of "conscientiousness" in connection
with the matter; if he could do that, his conscience would certainly
so him to make any false quotations, however great, so long as
e thought he could escape detection. But few would care to accuse
Eusebius of possessing such a character.
Certainly if he possessed
it, we should find clearer traces of it than we do in his History,
where we have the opportunity to control a large portion of his state.
ments on an immense variety of subjects. Moreover, for such a grave
act of deception as Eusebius is supposed to have committed, some
adequate ground must have existed.
But what ground was there?
The only motive suggested is that he desired to appear to possess
specific Koi... about the manner of Justin's death, when in fact
he did not possess it.
It is not maintained that he had any larger
motive, such as reconciling apparent contradictions in sacred records,
or shedding an added luster upon the Christian religion, for neither
of these purposes has any relation to the statement in regard to
Solely then for the sake
Crescens' connection with Justin's death.
of producing the impression that he knew more about Justin's death
than he did, he must have made the change.
But certainly when
we realize how frequently Eusebius directly avows his ignorance on
points far more important (to his mind) than this (e.g., the dates of
the Jerusalem bishops, which he might so easily have invented), and
when we consider how sober his history is in comparison with the
accounts of the majority of his contemporaries, both Pagan and
Christian, how few fables he introduces, how seldom he embellishes
the narratives which he finds related in his sources with imaginary

the sciences of the Greeks and won no little
fame in them, and who has left a great many

figments of his own brain, - when, in fact, no such instances can be
found elsewhere, although, writing in the age he did, and for the
public for whom he did, he might have invented so many stories
without fear of detection, as his successors during the ancient and
middle ages were seldom loath to do, - when all this is taken into
consideration, we should hesitate long before we accuse Eusebius of
such deceptive conduct as is implied in the intentional alteration of
Tatian's account at this point.
It has been quite the custom to accuse
Eusebius of intentional deviations from the truth here and there, but
it must be remembered that he was either honest or dishonest, and
if he ever deliberately and intentionally deviated from the truth, his
general character for truthfulness is gone, unless the deviation were
only in some exceptional case, where the pressure to misrepresenta
tion was unusually strong, under which circumstances his reputation
for veracity in general might not be seriously impaired.
But the
o instance is not such an one, and if he was false here on so
ittle provocation, why should we think his character such as to
uarantee truthfulness in any place where falsehood might be more
esirable?

The fact is, however, that the grounds upon which the accusa
tion against Eusebius is based are very slender.
Nothing but the
strongest evidence should lead us to conclude that such a writer as
he practiced such wilful deception for reasons absolutely trivial.
But when we realize how little is known of the actual state of the
text of Tatian's Oratro at the time Eusebius wrote, we must ac
knowledge that to base an accusation on a difference between the
text of the History and the extant MSS. of the Oratio is at least a
little hasty. An examination of the latest critical edition of Tatian's
Oratio (that of Schwartz, in Gebhardt, and Harnack's Terte word
Öntersuch. IV. 1) shows us that in a number of instances the
testimony of the MSS. of Eusebius is accepted over against that of
the few extant MSS. of Tatian. The MS. of Tatian which Eusebius
used was therefore admittedly different at a number of points from
It is consequently not at all
all our existing MSS. of Tatian.
impossible that the MS. which he used read ueya Ao instead of xat
Çue as.
It happens, indeed, to be a fact that our three MSS. of
Tatian all present variations at this very point (one reads x at éue
dos, another, kal & ué of ov, another, koi out obs), showing that the
archetype, whatever it was, either offered difficulties to the copyists,
or else was partially illegible, and hence required conjectural emen
dations or additions.
It will be noticed that the closing verb of this
sentence is in the singular, so that the mention of both Justin and
Tatian in the beginning of the sentence may well have seemed to
some copyist quite incongruous, and it is not difficult to suppose
that under such circumstances, the text at this point being in any
case obscure or mutilated, such a copyist permitted himself to make
an alteration which was very cleyer and at the same time did away
with all the trouble. Textual critics will certainly find no difficulty
in such an assumption. The MSS. of Tatian are undoubtedly
nearer the original form at this point than those of Eusebius, but
we have no good grounds for supposing that Fusebius did not follow
the MS. which lay before him.

The question as to Eusebius' interpretation of the passage as he
found it is quite a different one.
It contains no direct statement
that Justin met his death in consequence of the plots of Crescens;
and finding no mention of such a fact, in the Acts of Martyrdom of
|...}} we may dismiss it as unhistorical and refuse to accept Euse
jius' interpretation of Tatian's words. To say, however, that Euse
bius intentionally misinterpreted those words is quite unwarranted.
He found in Justin's work an expressed expectation that he would
meet his death in this way, and he found in Tatian's work the
direct statement that Crescens did plot Justin's death as the latter
had predicted he would.
There was nothing more natural than to
conclude that Tatian meant to imply that Crescens had succeeded,
for why did he otherwise mention the matter at all, Eusebius might
well say, looking at the matter from his point of view, as an historian
interested at that moment in the fact of Justin's death. He does
undoubtedly show carelessness and lack of penetration in interpret
ing the passage as he does; but if he had been aware of the defect
in the evidence he presents, and had yet wished deceitfully to assert
the fact as a fact, he would certainly have omitted the passage alto
gether, or he would have bolstered it up with the statement that
other writers confirmed his conclusion, - a statement which only a
thoroughly and genuinely honest man would have scrupled to ...
Finally, to return to the original charge of falsification of the sources,
if he realized that the text of Tatian, with the kai čue tos, did not
establish Justin's death at the instigation of Crescens, he must have
realized at the same time that his altered text, while it might imply
it, certainly did not absolutely prove it, and hence he would not
have left his conclusion, ...}. |. stated as a demonstrated fact, to
rest upon so slender a basis, when he might so easily have adduced
any number of oral traditions in confirmation of it.
If he were dis
honest enough to alter the text, he would not have hesitated to state
in general terms that the fact is "a so supported by tradition." We
conclude, finally, that he read the passage as we now find it in the
MSS. of his History, and that his interpretation of the passage,
while false, was not intentionally so.

And he who taught that death should be

husband; she herself, too, having formerly
been of the same character.

came to the knowledge of the teachings of
Christ, she became temperate, and endeavored
to persuade her husband likewise to be temper

contrary to the law of nature and right, sought
every possible means of pleasure, desired
to be divorced from him. And when she
was earnestly entreated by her friends, who
counseled her still to remain with him, on the
ground that her husband might some time give
hope of amendment, she did violence to
herself and remained.

those actions which she had formerly recklessly

she delighted in drunkenness and in every vice,

up, - when she had gone from him contrary to

her, declaring that she was a Christian. And

was a lover of truth, and not of a deceitful and
false disposition, confessed that he was a Chris

him for a long time in the prison. And finally,

are now recording.
Also another work
against the Greeks," in which he discourses
at length upon most of the questions at issue
between us and the Greek philosophers, and dis
cusses the nature of demons. It is not necessary
for me to add any of these things here.
And still another work of his against the
Greeks has come down to us, to which he
gave the title Refutation.
And besides these
another, On the Sovereignty of God," which he
establishes not only from our Scriptures,
but also from the books of the Greeks. Still
further, a work entitled Psaltes," and another
disputation On the Soul, in which, after pro
pounding various questions concerning the prob
lem under discussion, he gives the opinions of
the Greek philosophers, promising to refute it,
and to present his own view in another
work. He composed also a dialogue against
the Jews, which he held in the city of
Ephesus with Trypho, a most distinguished
man among the Hebrews of that day.
In it
he shows how the divine grace urged him on
to the doctrine of the faith, and with what earn
estness he had formerly pursued philosophical
studies, and how ardent a search he had
made for the truth." And he records of the
Jews in the same work, that they were plot
ting against the teaching of Christ, asserting the

given by Harnack (p. 171 ff.) seems, the most probable one. Ac
cording to his theory, the Apology of Athenagoras (of whom none
of the Fathers, except Methodius and Philip of Side, seem to have
had any knowledge) was attributed to Justin by a copyist of the
third century, - who altered the address so as to throw it into Jus
tin's time, - and as such it came into the hands of Eusebius, who
mentions it among the works of Justin. That he does not quote
from it may be due to the fact that it contained nothing suited to his
purpose, or it is possible that he had some suspicions about it; the
last, however, is not probable, as he nowhere hints at them. That
some uncertainty, however, seemed to hang about the work is evi
dent. The erasure of the name of Athenagoras and the substitution
of Justin's name accounts for the almost total disappearance of the
former from history.
This Apology and his treatise on the resurrec
tion first appear again under his name in the eleventh century, and
exist now in seventeen MSS. (see Schafs, II. 731). The traditional
second Apology of Justin having thus after the eleventh century
disappeared, his one genuine Apology was divided by later copyists,
so that we still have apparently two separate apologies.

* This and the following were possibly genuine works of Justin;
but, as they are no longer extant, it is impossible to speak with
certainty. The two extant works, Discourse to the Greeks (Oratio
ad Graeces) and //ortatory Address to the Greeks (Cohortatio
ad Graecos), which are translated in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, I
p. 271-289, are to be regarded as the productions of later writers,
and are not to be identified with the two mentioned here (although
Otto defends them both, and Semisch defends the latter).

* We have no reason to think that this work was not genuine,
but it is no longer extant, and therefore certainty in the matter is
impossible.
It is not to be identified with the extant work upon the
same subject (translated in the Ante-Micene Fathers, I. p. 290-293),
which is the production of a later writer.

* This work and the following have entirely disappeared, but
were genuine productions of Justin, for all that we know to the con
trary.*This is a genuine work of Justin, and is still extant (translated
in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, I. p. 194-270). Its exact date is
uncertain, but it was written after de Apology (to which it refers in
chap. 129), and during the reign of Antoninus Pius (137-161). .

same things against Trypho: "Not only did you
not repent of the wickedness which you had
committed, but you selected at that time chosen
men, and you sent them out from Jerusalem
through all the land, to announce that the god
less heresy of the Christians had made its ap
pearance, and to accuse them of those things
which all that are ignorant of us say against us,
so that you become the causes not only of your
own injustice, but also of all other men's." "
He writes also that even down to his time
prophetic gifts shone in the Church." And
he mentions the Apocalypse of John, saying dis
tinctly that it was the apostle's." He also refers
to certain prophetic declarations, and accuses
Trypho on the ground that the Jews had cut
them out of the Scripture." A great many other
works of his are still in the hands of many
of the brethren." And the discourses of
the man were thought so worthy of study
even by the ancients, that Irenaeus quotes his
words: for instance, in the fourth book of his
work Against Heresies, where he writes as fol
lows:" "And Justin well says in his work against
Marcion, that he would not have believed the
Lord himself if he had preached another God be
sides the Creator"; and again in the fifth book
of the same work he says : * "And Justin well
said that before the coming of the Lord Satan
never dared to blaspheme God," because he
did not yet know his condemnation."
These things I have deemed it necessary
to say for the sake of stimulating the studi
ous to peruse his works with diligence. So much
concerning him.

Soter just above as the eleventh bishop, he felt compelled to make

It simply shows with what carelessness the work of trans

of twelve years remains between the death of Celadion and the acces

• ironous was born in Asia Minor, probably between the years
120 and 130.
There is great uncertainty as to the date of his birth,
some bringing it down almost to the middle of the second century,
while Dodwell carried it back to the year 97 or 98.
But these ex
tremes are wild; and a careful examination of all the sources which
can throw any light on the subject leads to the conclusion adopted
by Lipsius, and stated above.
In Asia Minor he was a pupil of
Polycarp (cf. the fragment of Irenaeus' letter to Florinus, quoted by
Eusebius, Bk. V. chap. 20). The Moscow MS. of the .1/artyrou or
Polycarpi states that Irenaeus was in Rome at the time of Polycarp's
martyrdom (155 or 156 A.D.), and appeals for its authority to a state
ment in Irenaeus' own writings, which does not exist in any extant
work, but may have been taken from an authentic work now lost
(cf. Gebhardt, in the Zeitschrift für die hist. Theologic, 1875, p. 362
sqq.). But whatever truth there may be in the report, we find him, at
the time of the great persecution of Lyons and Vienne (described in
the next book, chap. 1), a presbyter of the church at Lyons, and
carrying a letter from the confessors of that church to the bishop
After the death of
Eleutherus of Rome (see Bk. V. chap. 4).
Pothinus, which took place in 177 (see Bl V. Arce/. note 3, and
chap. 1, § 29), Irenaeus became bishop of Lyons, according to Bk. V
chap. 5. The exact date of his accession we do not know; but as
Folio, died during the persecution, and Irenaeus was still a pres
byter aster the close of the persecution in which he met his death, he
cannot have succeeded immediately.
Since Irenaeus, however, was,
according to Eusebius, Pothinus' next successor, no great length of
time can have elapsed between the death of the latter and the acces
sion of the former. At the time of the paschal controversy, while
Victor was bishop of Rome, Irenaeus was still bishop (according to
Bk. V. chap. 23).
This was toward the close of the second century.
His death is ordinarily put in the year 202 or 203, on the assump
tion that he suffered martyrdom under Septimius Severus. Jerome
is the first to call him a martyr, and that not in his de zor. Ž., but
in his Comment. on Esaiam (chap. 64), which was written some
years later.
It is quite possible that he confounded the Irenaeus in
question with another of the same name, who met his death in the
persecution of Diocletian.
Gregory of Tours first gives us a de
tailed account of the martyrdom, and in the Middle Ages Irenaeus
always figured as a martyr.
But all this has no weight at all, when
measured against the silence of Tertullian, Hippolytus, Eusebius,
and all the earlier Fathers.
Their silence must be accepted as con
clusive evidence that he was not a martyr; and if he was not, there
is no reason for assigning his death to the year 202 or 203. As we
have no trace of him, however, subsequent to the time o the pas
chal controversy, it is probable that he died, at the latest, soon after
the beginning of the third century.

Irenaeus was the most important of the polemical writers of an
tiquity, and his works formed a storehouse from which all subsequent
heresiographers drew. He is quoted very frequently by Eusebius as
an authority for events which lo during the second century,
and is treated by him with the most profound respect as one of the
greatest writers of the early Church. lo devotes an unusually
long chapter of his de vir. o. to him (chap. 35), but tells us nothing
that is not found in Eusebius' History.
His greatest work, and the
only one now extant, is his EAey Yos rat ā varpoon tos Vevoovvuov
Yvodeos, which is commonly cited under the brief title mpos 'Alpe

work. It was written - or at least the third book was - while Eleu
therus was bishop of Rome, i.e. between 174 and 189 (see Bk. III.
chap. 3, § 3, of the work itself). We are not able to fix the date of
its ."V. exactly. The author's primary object was to
refute Valentinianism (cf. Bk. I. Aroos., and Bk. III. Arse/.), but in
connection with that subject he takes occasion to say considerable

fragments of bare titles have been preserved,

I. 27. 4, and III.

Eusebius mentions this intention in i. V. chap. zo; and in Bk. IV.
chap. 25, he classes, Irenaeus among the authors who had written
against Marcion.
But we hear nothing of the existence of the work
from Irenaeus' successors, and it is possible that Eusebius is think.

1 The five books of Hegesippus, um our nuara or Memoirs, are
unfortunately lost; but a few fragments are preserved by Eusebius,
and one by Photius, which have been collected by Routh, Rei. Sac.
1. 205-219, and by Grabe, SAtef'egium, II. 203-214. This work has
procured for him from some sources the title of the "Father of
Church History," but the title is misplaced, for the work appears to
have been nothing more than a collection of reminiscences covering
the apostolic and post-apostolic ages, and drawn partly from written,
partly from oral sources, and in part from his own observation, and
quite without chronological order and historical completeness. We
know of no other works of his. Of Hegesippus himself we know
yery little. He apparently wrote his work during the episcopate of
Eleutherus (175-189 A.D.), for he does not name his successor. How
old he was at that time we do not know, but he was very likely a
man past middle life, and hence was probably born early in the
With this, his own statement in the passage quoted
second centu
by Eusebius, in chap. 8, that the deification of Antinotis took place
in his own day is quite consistent. The words of Jerome (de vir.
f/1. 22), who calls him a vicings, apostolicorum temporum, are
too indefinite to give its any light, even if they rest upon any
authority, as they probably do not. The journey which is mentioned
in this Chapter shows that his home must have been somewhere in
the East, and there is no reason to doubt that he was a Hebrew
Christian (see below, note 16).

* Of this Primus' we know only what Hegesippus tells us here.
We do not know the exact date of his episcopate, but it must have
been at least in part synchronous with the episoopate of Pius of
Rome (see chap. 11, note 14), for it was while Hegesippus was on
his way to Rome that he saw Primus; and since he remained in
Rome until the accession of Anicetus, he must have arrived there
while Pius, Anicetus' predecessor, was bishop, for having gone to
Rome on a visit, he can hardly have remained there a number of

The same author also describes the be

From them came

divided the unity of the Church by corrupt doc

ancient heresies which arose among the Jews,
in the following words: "There were, moreover,
various opinions in the circumcision, among the
children of Israel.
The following were those
that were opposed to the tribe of Judah and

version (according to Lightfoot).
If these words be accepted as
authentic, the o possible rendering seems to be the one which
has been adopted §y many scholars: "Being in Rome, I composed
a catalogue of bishops down to Anicetus." This rendering is adopted
also so htfoot, who holds that the list of Hegesippus is repro
duced by Epiphanius in his Panarium XXVII. 6 (see his essay in
The Academy, May 27, 1887, where this theory is broached, and
compare the writer's notice of it in Harmack's Theol. Lit. Zeitung
1887, No. 18). But against this rendering it must be said, first, that
motmostumv, "I

as F. aware, means "catalogue," and nowhere else does the

signifies "succession," and this is its common meaning.
Certainly,
if Hegesippus wished to say that he had composed a catalogue of
bishops, he could not have expressed himself more obscurely.
In
the second place, if Hegesippus had really composed a catalogue
of bishops and referred to it here, how does it happen that Eusebius,
who is so concerned to ascertain the succession of bishops in all the
leading sees nowhere gives that catalogue, and nowhere even refers
to it. He does give Irenaeus' catalogue of the Roman bishops in
Bk. V. chap. 6, but gives no hint there that he knows anything of a
similar list of: Hegesippus.
In fact, it is very difficult to
think that Hegesippus, in this passage, can have meant to say that
he had composed a catalogue of bishops, and it is practically impos
sible to believe that Eusebius can have understood him to mean that.
not modiumw, if they can be made to mean
But the words &vačoxnv
anything at all, can certainly be made to mean nothing else than
the composition of a catalogue, and hence it seems necessary to
make some correction in the text.
It is significant that Rufinus at
this point reads permansi ibi, which shows that he at least did not
understand Hegesippus to be speaking of a list of bishops.
Rufinus'
rendering gives us a hint of what must have stood in the original
from which he drew, and so Savilius, upon the margin of his M.S.,
substituted for 8taôoxiv the word 6tarpigny, probably simply as a
conjecture, but possibly upon the authority of some other MS. now
lost. He has been followed by some editors, including Heinichen,
who prints the word Starpigny in the text.
Val. retains 6taðoxnv in
his text, but accepts 6tarpigny as the true reading, and so translates.
This reading is now very widely adopted; and it; or some other
word with the same meaning, in all probability stood in the original
text.
In my notice of Lightfoot's article, I suggested the word
&aywynv, which, while not so common as Statp: Bnv, is yet used
with move to 6at in the same sense, and its very uncommonness would
account more easily for the change to the much commoner Övačoxnv,
which is epigraphically so like it.

The word uéxpt is incorrectly translated as ud by Walesius, who
reads, marist apud A nicetum. He is followed by Cruse, who
translates "I made my stay with Anicetus"; but u expt can mean
only "until." Hegesippus therefore, according to his own statement,
came to Rome before the accession of Anicetus and remained there
until the latter became bishop. See chap. 11, note 19, for the rela
tion of this statement to that of Eusebius.

Walesius pro

and which finds some support in the statement made by Eusebius in
Bk. III. chap. 32, § 7, But all the MSS. have 6 a Tooro, and, as
Stroth remarks, the illogical use of "therefore" at this point need
not greatly surprise us in view of the general looseness of Hegesip
pus' style. The phrase is perhaps used proleptically, with a reser
ence to what follows.

5 Os Thebuthis we know only what is told us here. The state
ment that he became a heretic because he was not chosen bishop
has about as much soundation as most reports of the kind.
It was
quite common for the Fathers to trace back the origin of sohisms to
*::::: (compare e.g. Tertullian's Adv. Val. 4, and De Bapt. 17).

• The seven sects are mentioned by Hegesippus just below.
Harnack maintains that Hegesippus in his treatment of heresies
used two sources, one of them being the lost Syntagma of Justin
(see his Quellenkritik des Gnosticismus, p. 37 sqq.).
Lipsius,
who in his Quellen der. Ketzergesch. combats many of Harnack's
positions, thinks it possible that Hegesippus may have had Justin's
Syntagma before him.

7 Simon Magus (see Bk. II. chap. 13, note 3).
* Cleobius is occasionally mentioned as a heretic by ecclesiastical
writers, but none of them seems to know anything more about him
than is told here by Hegesippus (see the article Cleočius in the
Dict, of Christ. Biog.).
• Trustworthy #mation in regard to Dositheus is very scanty,
but it is probable that he was one of the numerous Samaritan false
messiahs, and lived at about the time of, or possibly before, Christ.
"It seems likely that the Dositheans were a Jewish or Samaritan
ascetic sect, something akin to the Essenes, existing from before
our Lord's time, and that the stories connecting their founder with
Simon Magus and with John the Baptist [see the Clement one Recog
nitions, f; 8 and Homoses, II. 24], may be dismissed as merely
mythical" (Salmon, in the Dict. of Christ. Biog, art. 10cs;theus).
* Epiphanius and Theodoret also mention the Goratheni, but
apparently knew no more about them than Hegesippus tells us here,
Epiphanius classing them among the Samaritans, and Theodoret
deriving them from Simon Magus.
11 The name Masbotheus is supported by no M.S. authority, but is
iven by Rufinus and by Nicephorus, and is adopted by most editors.
The majority of the \ss. read simply Mao Booga to or Mao Buteot.
Just below, Hegesippus gives the Masbotheans as one of the seven
Jewish sects, j. here | says they were derived from them. This
contradiction Harmack explains by Hegesippus' use of two different
sources, an unknown oral or written one, and Justin's Syntagma.
The list of heresies given here he maintains stood in !". Syn
tagma, but the derivation of them from the seven Jewish sects cannot
have been Justin's work, nor can the list of the seven sects have been
made by Justin, for he gives, quite a different list in his Dialogue,
chap. 86. Lipsius, p. 25, thinks the repetition of the "Masbotheans"
is more easily explained as a mere oversight or accident. The
Apostolic Const. VI. 6 name the Masbotheans among Jewish sects,
describing them as follows: "The Basmotheans, who deny provi
dence, and say that the world is ruled by spontaneous motion,
and take away the immortality of the soul." From what source
this description was taken we do not know, and cannot decide as, to
its reliability. Salmon (in the Dict. of Christ. Afog.) remarks that
"our real łowo. is limited to the occurrence of the name in
Hegesippus, and there is no reason to think that any of those
who have undertaken to explain it knew any more about the matter
than ourselves."

12 On Menander and the Menandrianists, see Bk. II. chap. 26;
on the Carpocratians, chap. 7, note 17; on the Valentinians, see
chap. 11, note 1; on the Basilidaeans, chap. 7, note 7; on the Satur
milians, chap. 7, note 6.
13 There is some dispute about this word. The Greek is Mapst
avuorrat, which #. regards as equivalent to Maps to via Tat, or
"followers of Marcion," but which Lipsius takes to mean "followers
of Marcus." The latter is clearly epigraphically more correct, but
the reasons for reading in this place Marcionites, or followers of
Marcion, are strong enough to outweigh other considerations (see
Harnack, p. 31 ff. and Lipsius, p. 29 f.).

And he wrote of many other matters, which
we have in part already mentioned, intro
ducing the accounts in their appropriate places.
And from the Syriac Gospel according to the
Hebrews he quotes some passages in the Hebrew
tongue," showing that he was a convert from
the Hebrews," and he mentions other matters
as taken from the unwritten tradition of the
Jews. And not only he, but also Irenaeus
and the whole company of the ancients,
called the Proverbs of Solomon All-virtuous Wis
dom." And when speaking of the books called
Apocrypha, he records that some of them were
composed in his day by certain heretics.
But
let us now pass on to another.

* These are the seven Jewish heresies mentioned above by Hege
sippus.
Justin (Dial. chap. 80) and Epiphanius (A nacesh.) also
name seven Jewish sects, but they are not the same as those
mentioned here (those of Justin: Sadducees, Genistae, Meristae,
Galileans, Hellenianians, Pharisees, Baptists). Epiphanius (Vol. I.
É. 23o, Dindors's ed., - Samaritan sects 4: Gorothenes, >eBovaiot,
Pharisees, Sadducees,

15 The exact meaning of this sentence is very difficult to deter
mine. The Greek reads: ex re roi, ka8' 'EBPatous evayyeatou kat
roo Suptakob Kai i8tos éx tos "E8patóos 8taxextov riva ribnortv.
It
is grammatically necessary to supply evayye Atov after >vptakov,
and this gives us a Syriac gospel in addition to the Hebrew. Some
have concluded that Tatian's Diatessaron is meant by it, but this
will not do; for, as Handmann remarks, the fact that Hegesippus
quotes from the work or works referred to is cited as evidence that
Hilgenfeld supposes that the Chaldaro syroque
he was a Hebrew.

tions, is refer
‘EBoatovs is a Greek translation, while the to Suptakov represents
the original; so that Hegesippus is said to have used both i. origi
nal and the translation.
Eusebius, however, could not have made
the discovery that he used both, unless the original and the transla
tion differed in their contents, of which we have no hint, and which
in itself is quite improbable. As the Greek reads, however, there is
no other explanation possible, unless the to Sivotaxov evayyeavov be
taken to represent some other unknown Hebrew gospel, in which
case the following clause refers to the citations from both of the gos
É. That such a gospel existed, however, and was referred to by
usebius so casually, as if it were a well-known work, is not con
ceivable. The only resource left, so far as the writer can discover, is to
amend the text, with Eichhorn, Nicholson, and Handmann, by strik
ing out the first kai. The Too Suptaxoi, then becomes a description
of the evayye Atov ka? 'E3patovs, "The Syriac Gospel according to
the Hebrews." By the Syriac we are to understand, of course, the
vulgar dialect, which had before the time of Christ taken the place
of the Hebrew, and which is ordinarily called Aramaic.
Eusebius
then, on this interpretation, first qualifies the Gospel of the Hebrews
more exactly, and then adds that Hegesippus quotes from the He
brew original of it (ex Tris
E8patóos Staxex row), and not from a
translation; e.g. from the Greek translation, which we know ex
isted early. #. is, to be sure, no MS. authority for the altera
tion of the text, and yet the sense of the passage seems to demand
it, and I have consequently omitted the kat in my translation. Upon
the interpretation of the passage, see Handmann's Hebräe r-Evan
£e'or, m, p. 32 ft., and upon the Gospel according to the Hebrews, see
above i. #" chap. 25, note 24, and chap. 27, note 8.
to Eusebius had abund in opportunity to learn from Hegesippus'
works whether or not he was a Hebrew Christian, and hence we
cannot doubt that his conclusion in regard to Hegesippus' nationality
(whether based merely upon the premises given here, or partly
|. other facts unknown to us) is correct.
His nationality ex
plains the fact that he deduces the Christian heresies from Jewish.
and not, like other writers, from heathen roots.
There is, however,
no reason, with Baur and others, to suppose that Hegesippus was a
Judaizer.
In fact, Eusebius' respectful treatment of him is in itself
conclusive proof that his writings cannot have revealed heretical
notions.
17 This phrase (maváperos gobia) was very frequently employed
among the Fathers as a title of the Book of *... Clement of
Rome (1 Cor. lvii.) is, so far as I know, the first so to use it. The
word mavaperos is applied also to the apocryphal Wisdom of Solo
mon, o Epiphanius (de mens. et fond. § 4) and others. Among
the Fathers the Book of Sirach, the Solomonic Apocrypha, and the
Book of Proverbs all bore the common title godda, "Wisdom,"
which well defines the character of each of them; and this simple title
is commoner than the compound phrase which occurs in this pas

Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, and the Epist/es
which he wrote."

AND first we must speak of Dionysius,
who was appointed bishop of the church in
Corinth, and communicated freely of his inspired
labors not only to his own people, but also to
those in foreign lands, and rendered the greatest
service to all in the catholic epistles which
he wrote to the churches. Among these is
the one addressed to the Lacedaemonians,"
containing instruction in the orthodox faith and
an admonition to peace and unity; the one also
addressed to the Athenians, exciting them to
faith and to the life prescribed by the Gospel,
which he accuses them of esteeming lightly, as
if they had almost apostatized from the faith
since the martyrdom of their ruler Publius,"
which had taken place during the persecu
tions of those days. He mentions Quadratus" also, stating that he was appointed
their bishop after the martyrdom of Publius, and
testifying that through his zeal they were brought
together again and their faith revived. He re
cords, moreover, that Dionysius the Areopagite,"

sage (cf. e.g. Justin Martyr's Dial. c. 129, and Melito, quoted by
Eusebius in chap. 26, below). For further particulars, see especially
Lightfoot's edition of the epistles of Clement of Rome, p. 164.

1 Fusebius speaks, in this chapter, of seven Catholic epistles,
and of one addressed to an individual. None of these epistles are
now extant, though Eusebius here, and in Bk. II. chap. 25, gives us
four brief but interesting fragments from the Epistle to the Romans.
We know of the other epistles only what Eusebius tells us in this
That Dionysius was held in high esteem as a writer of
chapter.
epistles to the churches is clear, not only from Eusebius' statement,
but also from the fact that heretics thought it worth while to circu
late interpolated and mutilated copies of them, as stated below. The
fact that he wrote epistles to churches so widely scattered shows
that he possessed an extended reputation.

Of Dionysius himself (who is, without foundation, called a mar
tyr by the Greek Church, and a confessor by the Latin Church) we
know only what we are told by Eusebius, for Jerome (de for. o.
37) adds nothing to the account given in this chapter. In his Chron.
Eusebius mentions Dionysius in connection with the eleventh year
of Marcus Aurelius. According to Eusebius' statement in this same
chapter, Dionysius' Epistle to the Romans was addressed to the
bishop Soter, and as Eusebius had the epistle before him, there is no
reason for doubting his report.
Soter was bishop from about 167 to
175 (see above, chap. 19, note 4), and therefore the statements of
the Chron, and the //istory are in accord. When Dionysius died
we do not know, but he was no longer living in 199, for Bacchylus
was bishop of Corinth at that time (see Bk. V. chap. 22).
It is com
monly said that Dionysius was the immediate successor of Primus,
bishop of Corinth. This may be true, but we have no ground for
the assumption. We know only that Primus' episcopate was syn
chronous, at least in part, with that of Pius of Rome (see the pre
vious chapter, note o who was bishop from about 139 or 14 to 154
or 156, and that Dionysius' episcopate was synchronous at least in
part with that of Soter of Rome (about 167 to 175).

2 This is, so far as I am aware, the earliest mention of a church
at Lacedaemon or Sparta. The bishop of Sparta is mentioned in
the synodical letter of the province of Hellas to the emperor Leo
(457-477 A.D.), and also still later in the Acts of the Sixth and
Fighth General Synods, according to Wiltsch's Geography and
Statistics of the Church (London ed. p. 134 and 466).

* Of this Publius we know only what Eusebius tells us here.
What particular perscoution is referred to we cannot tell, but Pub
lius' martyrdom seems to have occurred in the reign of Antoninus
Pius or Marcus Aurelius; for he was the immediate predecessor of
Quadratus, who was apparently bishop at the time Dionysius was
writing.
* We know nothing more about this Quadratus, for he is to be
distinguished from the prophet and from the apologist (see chap. 3,
note 2). Eusebius' words seem to imply that i. was bishop at the
time I)ionysius was writing.

because of the many acts of fortitude which are

against the aberrations of the
heretics.

fers to Bacchylides" and Elpistus, as having
urged him to write, and he adds explanations of

7 The extent of fonysius influence is shown by his writing an
epistle to so distant a church as that of Nicomedia in Bithynia, and
also to the churches of Pontus (see below). The fact that he con
siders it necessary to attack Marcionism in this epistle to the Nico
medians is an indication of the wide and rapid spread of that sect, -
which indeed is known to us from many sources.

13. It is quite likely, as Salmon suggests (in the 12tcf. of Christ.
Biog.), that Dionysius, who wrote against Marcion in this epistle to
§§§.i. also had Marcionism in view in writing on life and
discipline to the churches of Pontus, and Crete. . It was probably in
consequence of reaction against their strict discipline that he advo
cated the readmission to the Church of excommunicated offenders,
in this anticipating the later practice of the Roman church, which
was introduced by Callixtus and soon afterward became general,
though not without bitter opposition from many quarters. Harnack
(100&nzengeschächte, o: 332, note 4) throws doubt upon the correct
ness of this report of Eusebius; but such doubt is unwarranted, for
Eusebius had Dionysius' epistle before him, and the position which
he represents him as taking is quite in accord with the mildness
which he recommends to Pinytus, and is therefore just what we
should expect; , The fact that Callixtus' principle is looked upon b
Tertullian and Hippolytus as an innovation does not militate at .
against the possibility that, Dionysius in Corinth, or other indi
. in other minor churches, held the same principles some time

ore.

. This epistle is no longer extant, nor do we know anything about
Pinytus himself except what is told us here and in chap. 21, above,

!. (de for ill. 28) only repeats what Eusebius says, and
ufinus, in stating that Pinytus was convinced by the epistle of

was not led by Dionysius' epistle to agree with him.

the parish, not to lay upon the brethren a grievous
and compulsory burden in regard to chastity, but
to have regard to the weakness of the mul
titude.
Pinytus, replying to this epistle, admires and commends Dionysius, but exhorts
him in turn to impart some time more solid food,
and to feed the people under him, when he wrote
again, with more advanced teaching, that they
might not be fed continually on these milky
doctrines and imperceptibly grow old under a
training calculated for children.
In this epistle
also Pinytus' orthodoxy in the faith and his care
for the welfare of those placed under him, his
learning and his comprehension of divine things,
are revealed as in a most perfect image.

There is extant also another epistle written
by Dionysius to the Romans, and addressed
to Soter," who was bishop at that time. We can
not do better than to subjoin some passages from
this epistle, in which he commends the practice
of the Romans which has been retained down
to the persecution in our own days.
His
words are as follows: "For from the begin
ning it has been your practice to do good to
all the brethren in various ways, and to send con
tributions to many churches in every city. Thus
relieving the want of the needy, and making
provision for the brethren in the mines by the
gifts which you have sent from the beginning,
you Romans keep up the hereditary customs of
the Romans, which your blessed bishop Soter
has not only maintained, but also added to, fur
nishing an abundance of supplies to the saints,
and encouraging the brethren from abroad with
blessed words, as a loving father his chil:
dren."
In this same epistle he makes
mention also of Clement's epistle to the
Corinthians," showing that it had been the cus
tom from the beginning to read it in the church.
His words are as follows: "To-day we have
passed the Lord's holy day, in which we have
read your epistle.
From it, whenever we read
it, we shall always be able to draw advice, as also
from the former epistle, which was written
to us through Clement." The same writer
also speaks as follows concerning his own
epistles, alleging that they had been mutilated:
"As the brethren desired me to write epistles, J
wrote. And these epistles the apostles of the
devil have filled with tares, cutting out some
things and adding others."
For them a woe is
It is, therefore, not to be wondered
reserved."

This practice of the Roman church combined with other causes
to secure it that position of influence and prominence which resulted
in the primacy of its bishop, and finally in the papacy. . The posi;
tion of the Roman church, as well as its prosperity and numerical
strength, gave it early a feeling that it was called upon in an espe
cial way to exercise oversight and to care for weaker sister churches,
and thus its own good offices helped to promote its influence and its

Jerome devotes chap. 25 of his de Zir. ill. to him.
yond this
there is no direct mention of Theophilus, or of his works, during the
early centuries (except that of Malalas, which will be referred to
below).
Eusebius here calls Theophilus bishop of Antioch, and in
chap. 20 makes him the sixth bishop, as does also Jerome in his
de joir, ill, chap. 35.
But in his epistle, ad Algas. (Migne, FA.

the accession of Theophilus into the ninth year of Marcus Aurelius
(169); and this may be at least approximately correct. The acces
sion of his successor Maximus is put into the seventeenth year (177);
but this date is at least four years too early, for his work, ad Autoly
cum, quotes from a work in which the death of Marcus Aurelius
(who died in 180) was mentioned, and hence cannot have been written
before 181 or 182. We know that his successor, Maximus, became
bishop sometime between *. and 192, and hence Theophilus died
between 181 and that time. We have o Eusebius' words (Jerome
simply repeats Eusebius' statement) for the fact that Theophilus was
bishop of Antioch (his extant works do not mention the fact, nor do
those who quote from his writings), but there is no good ground for
oting the truth of the report. We know nothing more about his
In addition to the works mentioned in this chapter, Jerome
(de Tor. iii.) refers to Commentaries upon the Gospel and the book
Lega sub nomine cytes in
of Proverbs, in the following words:
Evange/Fum et in Proverbia Salomont's Commentarios 7 to m oho
c: n superiorum zoo/re minum elegantia et Ah rast non wasentur
congrucre. The commentary upon the Gospel is referred to by
Jerome again in the preface to his own commentary on Matthew;
and in his epistle, ad Agasia mt, he speaks of a harmony of the four
Gospels, by Theophilus (yur Quatroor Ezra itselisza ru mt in on on
of us dicta compingens), which may have been identical with the
commentary, or may have formed a basis for it.
This commentary
is mentioned by none of the Fathers before or after Jerome; and
Jerome himself expresses doubts as to its genuineness, or at least he
does not think that its style compares with that of the other works
ascribed to Theophilus. Whether the commentary was genuine or
not we have no means of deciding, for it is no longer extant. There
is in existence a Latin commentary on the Gospels in four books,
which bears the name of Theophilus, and is published in Otto's
Corpus A/o/. Vol. VIII. p. 278-324. This was universally regarded
as a spurious work until Zahn, in 1883 (in his Forschungen zur
Grsch. des N. T. Canons, Theil II.) made an elaborate effort to
rove it a genuine work of Theophilus of Antioch.
Harnack,
owever, in his Terte und. Unters. I. 4, p. 97-175, has shown
conclusively that Zahn is mistaken, and that the extant commentary
is nothing better than a Post-Nicene compilation from the works of
various Latin Fathers. Zahn; in his reply to Harnack (Forsch un
gen, Theil III. Beilage 3), still maintains that the Commentary is a
genuine work of Theophilus, with large interpolations, but there is
no adequate ground for such a theory; and it has found few, if any,
e must conclude, then, that if Theophilus did write

such a commentary, it is no longer extant.

The three books addressed to Autolycus (a heathen friend other
wise unknown to us) are still extant in three Mediaeval MSS. and
have been frequently published both in the original and in translation.

three elementary works addressed to Autolycus

the Heresy of Hermogenes," in which he makes
use of testimonies from the Apocalypse of John,
and finally certain other catechetical books."
And as the heretics, no less then than at
other times, were like tares, destroying the
pure harvest of apostolic teaching, the pastors
of the churches everywhere hastened to restrain
them as wild beasts from the fold of Christ, at
one time by admonitions and exhortations to
the brethren, at another time by contending
more openly against them in oral discussions
and refutations, and again by correcting their
opinions with most accurate proofs in writ
ten works. And that Theophilus also, with
the others, contended against them, is man
ifest from a certain discourse of no common
merit written by him against Marcion."

spoken, has been preserved to the present day.

his literary style is of a high order. He acknowledges no good in
the Greek philosophers, except what they have taken from the Old
Testament writers. The genuineness of the work has been attacked,
but without sufficient reason.

From Book II, chap. 30 of his ad Autol. we learn that Theophi
lus had written also a work On History. No such work is extant,
nor is it mentioned by Eusebius or any other Father.
Malalas,
however, cites a number of times, "The chronologist Theophilus,"

Harnack
(p. 294 f.) gives strong grounds for supposing that it was the com
mon source from which Tertullian, in his work ad Hermogeneon,
Hippolytus, in his Phil. VIII. Io and X. 24, and Clement of Alex
andria, in his Proph. Selections, 56, all drew.
If this be true, as
seems probable, the Hermogenes attacked by these various writers
is one man, and his chief heresy, as we learn from Tertullian and
Hippolytus, was that God did not create the world out of nothing,
but only formed it out of matter which, like himself, was §§

nature than is thus told us by Jerome.
* This work, which is also now lost, is mentioned by no other
Father except Jerome, who puts it first in his list of Theophilus'
writings, but does not characterize it in any way, though he says it
was extant in his time.
Irenaeus, in four passages of his great work,
exhibits striking parallels to Bk. II. chap. 25 of Theophilus' ad
A uto., which have led to the assumption that he knew the latter
work.
Harnack, however, on account of the shortness of time
which elapsed between the composition of the ad Arctos. and I re
naeus' work, and also on account of the nature of the resemblances
between the parallel passages, thinks it improbable that Irenaeus
used the ad Autol., and concludes that he was acquainted rather
with Theophilus' work against Marcion, a conclusion which accords
best with the facts known to us.

and was succeeded by Serapion in 190.
As remarked in note 1,
above, the former date is incorrect, for Theophilus must have lived
at least as late as 181 or 182. We cannot reach certainty in regard
to the date either of his accession or of his death; but if Eusebius'
statement (in Bk...V. chap. 19), that Serapion was bishop while
Commodus was still emperor, is to be believed (see further, Bk. V.
chap, 19, note 1), Maximinus must have died at least as early as 192,
which gives us for his episcopate some part of the period from 181 to
192. We know no particulars in ...! to the life of Maximinus.

works are still preserved by a great many of the
brethren.

* See above, chap. 23, § 5.
* Philip's work against Marcion which Eusebius mentions here
is no longer extant, and, so far as the writer knows, is mentioned by
no other Father except Jerome (de vir. ill. 30), who tells us only
what Eusebius records here, using, however, the adjective praecia
run for Eusebius' ormovéatór arov.

* On Irenaeus, see above, chap. 21, note 9.
"Modestus; also, is a writer known to us only from Eusebius
(here, and in chap. 21) and from Jerome (de zir. 17/. 32). Accord
ing to the latter, the work against Marcion was still extant in his
day, but he gives us no description of it. He adds, however, that a
number of spurious works ascribed to Modestus were in circulation
at that time (Feruntur sub nomine ejus et alia syntagmata, sed
as eruditos Quasi bevööypaspa repudiantur).
Neither these nor
the genuine works are now extant, so far as we know.

* The first extant notice of Melito, bishop of Sardis, is found in
the letter addressed by Polycrates to Bishop Victor of Rome (c. 190202 A.D.) in support of the Quartodeciman practice of the Asia
Minor churches. A fragment of this letter is given by Eusebius in
Bk. V. chap. 24, and from it we learn that Melito also favored the
Quartodeciman practice, that he was a man whose walk and conver
sation were altogether under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and
that he was buried, at Sardis.
Polycrates in this fragment, calls
Melito a eunuch. Whether the word is to be understood in its literal
sense or is to be taken as meaning simply that Melito lived in "vir
gin continence" is disputed.
In favor of the latter interpretation
may be urged the fast that the Greek word and its Latin equivalent
were very commonly used by the Fathers in this figurative sense,
e.g. by Athenagoras, by Tertullian, by Clement of Alexandria, by
Cassianus (whose work on continence bore the title mept ovkpareias,
n. 7 ept eviouxias), by Jerome, Epiphanius, Chrysostom, Theodoret,
Gregory Nazianzen, &c. (see Smith and Wace's Dict. of Christ.
Biog., article J/elito, and Suicer's Thesaurus). On the other
hand, s'ich continence cannot have been a rare thing in Asia Minor
in the time of Polycrates, and the fact that Melito is called specifi
cally "the eunuch" looks, peculiar if nothing more than that is
meant by it. The case of Origen, who made himself a eunuch for
the sake of preserving his chastity, at once occurs to us in this con
nection (see Renan, L'église ch ret. p. 436, and compare Justin Mar
tyr's Apol. I. 29). The canonical rule that no ..", eunuch could
hold clerical office came later, and hence the fact that Mclito was a
bishop cannot be urged against the literal interpretation of the word
here.
Polycrates' meaning hardly admits of an absolute decision,
but at least it cannot be looked upon as it is by most historians as
certain that he uses the word here in its figurative sense.

Polycrates says nothing of the fact that Melito was a writer,
but we learn from this chapter (§ 4), and from Bk. VI, chap. 13,
that Clement of Alexandria, in a lost work, mentioned his writings
and even wrote a work in reply to one of his (see below, note 23).
According to the present chapter he was a very prolific writer, and
that he was a man of marked talent is clear from Jerome's words
in his de vir. ill. chap. 24 (where he refers to Tertullian's lost work,
de Ecstasi): Hujus [i.e. Melitoni's], elegans et declamatorium
ingenium Tertullianus in se/tem libris, 7 uos scrips it adversus
ecclesiam Aro Montano, carvillatur, dice us eum a plerisque mos
trorum Aro/hetam Autari.
In spite of the fact that Tertullian
satirized Melito's talent, he nevertheless was greatly influenced by
his writings and owed much to them (see the points of contact be
that he was o: by many as a prophet accords well with Poly
tween the two men given by Harnack, p. 250 sqq.). The statement
crates' description of him referred to above. The indications, all
point to the fact that Melito was decidedly ascetic in his tendencies,
and that he had a great deal in common with the spirit which gave

of Hierapolis, enjoyed great distinction.
Each
of them on his own part addressed apologies in
behalf of the faith to the above-mentioned em
peror" of the Romans who was reigning at
that time. The following works of these
writers have come to our knowledge.
Of
Melito,' the two books On the Passover," and

rise to Montanism and even made Tertullian a Montanist, and yet
at the same time he opposed Montanism, and is therefore spoken of
slightingly by Tertullian.
His position, so similar to that of the
Montanists, was not in favor with the orthodox theologians of the
third century, and this helps to explain why, although he was such a
prolific and talented writer, and although he remained orthodox, he
nevertheless passed almost entirely out of the memory of the Church
of the third and following centuries. To this is to be added the fact
that Melito was a chiliast; and the teachings of the Montanists
brought such disrepute upon chiliasm that the Fathers of the third
and É. centuries did not show much fondness for those who
held or had held these views.
Very few notices of Melito's works
are found among the Fathers, and none of those works is to-day
extant.
Eusebius is the first to give us an idea of the number and
variety of his writings, and he does little more than mention the
titles, a fact to be explained only by his lack of sympathy with
Melito's views.

The time at which Melito lived is indicated with sufficient exact
ness by the fact that he wrote his AAology during the reign of
Marcus Aurelius, but after the death of his brother Lucius, i.e. aster
169 (see below, note 21); and that when Polycrates wrote his epistle
It is
to Victor of Rome, he had been dead already some years.
ssible (as held by Piper, Otto, and others) that his Apology was
is last work, for Eusebius mentions it last in his list.
t the same
time, it is quite as possible that Eusebius enumerates Melito's works
simply in the order in which he sound them arranged in the libra
of Caesarea, where he had perhaps seen them. Of the dates of his
episcopacy, and of his predecessors and successors in the see of
Sardis, we know nothing.

In addition to the works mentioned in this chapter by Eusebius,
who does not pretend to give a full list, we find in Anastasius Sinaita's
Hodegos seu du r viae c. acesh. fragments from two other works
entitled ets to tra60s and nepi oapk togeos xpt a toû (the latter directed
against Marcion), which cannot be identified with any mentioned by
Eusebius (see Harnack, I. 1, p. 254). The Code-r, Mitriacus Museo
Britannic: 12,156 contains {u: #igo ascribed to Melito, of
which the first belongs undoubtedly to his genuine work Topi Wuxis
kai arguaros, which is mentioned in this chapter by Eusebius. The
second purports to be taken from a work, mept gravpov, of which we
hear nowhere else, and which may or may not have been by Melito.
The third fragment bears the title Meliton is episcopi de for, and
might be looked upon as an extract from the work nepi statews,
mentioned by Eusebius (as Otto regards it); but the same fragment
is four times ascribed to Irenaeus by other early authorities, and an
analysis of these authorities shows that the tradition in favor of
Irenaeus is stronger than that in favor of Melito, and so Harnack
mentions a work, mept to rews, which is ascribed by Maximus Con
sessor to Irenaeus, and from which the quotation may have been
taken (see Harnack, off. p.266 s.).
The fourth fragment was
taken in all probability from Melito's work, Tepi, matovs, mentioned
by Anastasius. An Apology in Syriac, bearing the name, of Melito,
is extant in another of the Nitrian MSS. in the British Museum
(No. 14,658), and has been published with, an English translation by
Cureton, in his Spic. Syr. | : . It has been proved, how
ever, that this Apology (which we have entire) was not written by
Melito, but probably by an inhabitant of Syria, in the latter part of
the second, or early part of the third century, - whether originally
in the Greek or Syriac language is uncertain (see Harmack, p. 261 ff.,

writings, there must be mentioned ão some spurious works which
are still extant. Two Latin works of the early Middle Ages, entitled
de transitu Maria and de passione S. Joannis Evangelista, and
also a Catona of the latter'Middle Ages on the Apocalypse, and a
Clavis Scripturae of the Carlovingian period (see below, note, 18,

name was not entirely forgotten in the Occidental Church of the
Middle Ages, though * exact knowledge of him scems to have
existed.

the discourse On the Church,' and one On the

On the Obedience of Faith, and one On the
Senses;" besides these the work On the Soul
and Body," and that On Baptism," and the one

naps enables us to fix approximately the date at which it was
written.
Rufinus reads Sergius Paulus, instead of Servilius Paulus,
which is sound in all the Greek MSS. Sergius Paulus is known to
have had his second consulship in 168, and it is inferred by Wad
dington that he was proconsul about 164 to 166 (see Fastes des
{..., Asiationes, chap. 2, § 148). No Servilius Paulus is
nown in connection with the province of Asia, and hence it seems
probable that Rufinus is correct; and if so, the work on the Passover
was written early in the sixties. The fragment which Eusebius
gives in this chapter is the only part of his work that is extant.
It
was undoubtedly in favor of §§ Quartodeciman practice, for Poly
crates, who was a decided Quartodeciman, cites Melito in support of
his position.

* The exact reading at this point is disputed.

I read, with a
number of MSS., to trepi moat retas kai mpoonrov, making but one
work, On the Conduct of Life and the Prophets. Many MSS.,

other On the Prophets), or one work containing more than one

Christophorsonus, Stroth, Zimmermann, Burton, and Harnack con
sequently read o meet wraxons Tia Teos, o mept a to 6 minotov, con
cluding that the words o Tept after m to retos have fallen out of the
Greek text. I have adopted this reading in my translation.

** A serious difficulty arises in connection with this title from the
fact that most of the Greek. MSS. read on ept lov Kns rat a wou aros )
voas, while the Syriac, Rufinus, and Jerome omit the n voo's entirely.
Nicephorus and two of the Greek MSS. meanwhile read ov ov .

MSS. are unanimous for this reading.
Otto, Cruse, and Salmon
read kai wojs, but there is no authority for kai instead of 5, and the
change cannot be admitted. The explanation which Otto gives
(p. 376) of the change of h to kai will not hold, as Harnack shows
on p. 247, note 346.
It seems to me certain that the words n roos
did not stand in the original, but that the word voos (either alone or
preceded by h or xat) was written upon the margin by some scribe,
perhaps as an alternative to lux.ns, perhaps as an addition in the
interest of trichotomy, and was later inserted in the text after Juxons
and gouaros, under the impression that it was an alternative title
of the book. My reasons for this opinion are the agreement of the
versions in the omission of vods, the impossibility of explaining the
in before woos in the original text, the fact that in the Greek MSS.,
in Rufinus, and in the Syriac, the words kai Tepi ovyns Kai orouaros
are repeated further down in the list, - a repetition which Harnack
thinks was made inadvertently by Eusebius himself, and which in
omitting voos confirms the omission of it in the present case, - and

is 6 nepi Aoutpoo; Jerome, de baptismate.
14 Apolinarius (according to chap. 27) also wrote a work On
Truth, and the place which it holds in that list, between an apolo

getical work addressed to the Greeks and one addressed to the §:

makes it probable that it too bore an apologetic character, being
perhaps devoted to showing that Christianity is, pre-eminently the
truth.
Melito's work on the same subject very likely bore a similar
character, as suggested by Salmon.

15 Six MSS., with Nicephorus, read kriorews, "creation," but
with the Syriac and Rufinus, and possibly Jerome, read
five M
mia rews. The latter reading therefore has the strongest external
testimony in its favor, but must be rejected (with Stroth, Otto,
Heinichen, Harnack, etc.) as evidently a dogmatic correction of the
fourth century, when there was an objection to the use of the word
krious in connection with Christ.
ufinus divides the one work
On the Creation and Generation of Christ into two, - On Faith
and On the Generation of Christ and his (...; connecting
the second with the next-mentioned work.
Jerome omits the first
clause entirely at this point, and translates simply de generatione
Christi librium unum. The de side, however, which he inserts
earlier in his list, where there is no corresponding word in the Greek,
may be the title which he omits here (see above, note 9), displaced,
as the title de sensibus is also displaced.
If this be true, he becomes
with Rufinus and the Syriac a witness to the reading rio rews instead
of xriaews, and like Rufinus divides the one work of Eusebius into
two.

* All the Greek MSS. read zai A6).os arrow of: m pod more tas,
which can rightly mean only "his work on Prophecy"; but Jerome
translates de Aroahetra sua forum unrem, and Rufinus de Arophe

All three therefore connect the auroi,

with the mpobntet as instead of with the A6).os, which of course is
much more natural, since the autoi, with the Aoyos seems quite unnec
essary at this point. The translation of the Syriac, Rufinus, and
Jerome, however, would require mept mpoon retas auroo or wept ros
awtoo mpoonreias, and there is no sign that the auroi, originally
stood in such connection with the m pod morečas. We must, therefore,
reject the rendering of these three versions as incorrect.

After this title a few of the MSS., with Ru

The word is omitted in the Syriac version. The nature of this work
we have no means of determining.
It is possible that it was a key
to the interpretation of the Scriptures, designed to guide the reader
in the study especially of the figures of the prophecies (cf. Otto, p.
Piper is right, however, in saying that
401) and of the Apocalypse.
it cannot have been intended to supply the allegorical meaning of
Scripture words, like the extant Latin Cazors of Pseudo-Melito,
mentioned just below; for Melito, who like Tertullian taught the
corporeality of God, must have been very literal - not allegorical -
in his interpretation of Scripture. A Latin work bearing the title
J/c/atozzi's Claris, Sanctae Scriff wrae was mentioned by Labbe in
1653 as contained in the library of Clermont College, and after years
of search was recovered and published by Pitra in 1855 in his Sørci
Jes. Solesm. Vols. II. and III. He regarded the work as a transla
tion, though with interpolations, of the genuine KAets of Melito, but
this hypothesis has been completely disproved (see the article by
Steitz, in the Studien word Aritiken, 1857, p. 184 sqq.), and the
work has been shown to be nothing more than a mediaeval dictionary
of allegorical interpolations of Scripture, compiled from the Latin
Fathers. There is, therefore, no trace extant of Melito's Key.

* All the Greek MSS. read xas Ta mept too 6taboxou, kai rins amo
Kaavu, eos "Ito avvov, making but one work, with two or more books,
upon the general subject, The Peziz and the .4/ocalypse of Żohn.
The Syriac apparently agrees with the Greek in this respect (see
Harmack, p. 248, note 350); but Jerome and Rufinus make two
works, the latter reading de diabolo /orn on to or on, de AAcca lysost
oannis librum unum. Origen, in Psalm. ///. (ed. Lommatzsch,
XI. p. 411), says that Melito treated Absalom as a type of the devil
warring against the kingdom of Christ.
It has been conjectured
that the reference may be to this work of Melito's, and that reference
is an argument for the supposition that Melito treated the devil and
the Apocalypse in one work (cf. Harnack, p. 248, and Smith and
Wace, p. 898).

dressed to Antoninus."
In the books On
the Passover he indicates the time at which
he wrote, beginning with these words: "While
Servilius Paulus was proconsul of Asia, at the time
when Sagaris suffered martyrdom, there arose
in Laodicea a great strife concerning the Pass
over, which fell according to rule in those
days; and these were written." " And
Clement of Alexandria refers to this work

his own discourse On the

(Selecta in Gen. I. 26; Lommatzsch, VIII. p. 49) enumerates Me
lito among those who taught the corporeality of God, and says that
he had written a work mept too & variouarov elva row be ov.
It is poo
sible, of course, that he may not have seen Melito's work, and that
its title and have mistaken a work on
he may have misunderst
the incarnation for one on the corporeality of God; but this is not
at all likely.
Either he had read the book, and knew it to be upon
the subject he states, or else he knew from other sources that Melito
believed in the corporeality of God, and hence had no doubt that this
work was upon that subject.
There is no reason in any case for
doubting the accuracy of Origen's statement, and for hesitating to
conclude that the work mentioned by Eusebius, was upon the cor
poreality of God. The close relationship existing between Melito
and Tertullian has already been referred to, and this fact furnishes
confirmation for the belief that Melito held God to be corporeal, for
we know Tertullian's views on that subject.
Gennadius (de eccles.
dogmat. chap. 4) classes Melito and Tertullian together, as both
teaching a corporeality in the Godhead. What was the source of
his statement, and how much dependence is to be put upon it, we
cannot say, but it is at least a corroboration of the conclusion
already reached. We conclude then that Rufinus and the Syriac
were mistaken in their rendering, and that this work discussed the
corporeality, not the incarnation, of God.

848Atôtov (libel

The Apology is mentioned also in chap. 13, above, and at the i.
ning of this chapter. Jerome puts it #: in his list, with the words:

have only the fragments which É. gives in this chapter. As
remarked in note 1, above, the extant Syriac Apology is not a work
of Melito's. . The Aéology is mentioned in Jerome's version of the
Chron., and is assigned to the tenth year of Marcus Aurelius,
12o A. D. The notice is omitted in the Armenian, which, however,
assigns to the eleventh year of Marcus Aurelius the Apology of
Apolinarius, which is connected with that of Melito in the Ch. Hist.
Moreover, a notice of the Apology is given by Syncellus in connec
tion with the tenth year of Marcus Aurelius, and also by the Chron.
Pasch., so that it is not improbable that Eusebius himself men
tioned it in his Chron., and that its omission in the Armenian is a
mistake (as Harnack thinks likely).
But though the notice may
thus have been made by Eusebius himself, we are nevertheless not
at liberty to accept the date given as conclusive. We learn from the
quotations given by Eusebius that the work was addressed to the
emperor after the death of Lucius Verus, i.e. after the year 169.
Whether before or after the association of Commodus with his father
in the imperial power, which took place in 176, is uncertain; but I
am inclined to think that the words quoted in § 7, below, point to a
prospective rather than to a present association of Commodus in the
empire, and that therefore the work was written between 169 and
176.
It must be admitted, however, that we can say with certainty
only that the work was written between 169 and 180. Some would
put the work at the beginning of those persecutions which raged in
177, and there is much to be said for this. But the dates of the local
and minor persecutions, which were so frequent during this period,
are so uncertain that little can be based upon the fact that we know
of persecutions in certain parts of the empire in 177.
Piper, Otto,
and others conclude from the fact that the Apology is mentioned last
by Eusebius that it was Melito's latest work; but that, though not
at all unlikely, does not necessarily follow (see above, note 1).

** A. Sagaris, bishop and martyr, and probably the same man,
is mentioned by Polycrates in his epistle to Victor (Euseb. V. 24)
as buried in Laodicea.
This is all we know of him. The date of
his martyrdom, and of the composition of the work On the Pass
over, depends upon the date of the proconsulship of Servilius (or
Sergius) Paulus (see above, note 5). The words ourégovros xara
Katpov have unnecessarily caused Šimo considerable trouble. The
words karū kalpów mean no more than "properly, regularly, accord
ing to appointment or rule," and do not render oxetvats rats huépaws
superfluous, as he thinks.
The clause kai typion Tavra ("and
these were written '') expresses result, - it was in consequence of
the passover strife that Melito wrote this work.

* This work of Clement's, On the Passozier, which he says he
wrote on occasion of Melito's work, was clearly written in reply to
and therefore against the work of Melito, not as a supplement to it,
as Hefele, supposes (Concillengesch. I. 299). The work of Clem
ent (which is mentioned by Eusebius, VI. 13, in his list of Clement's

which, he says, he wrote on occasion of
Melito's work.
But in his book addressed
to the emperor he records that the follow
ing events happened to us under him : "For,
what never before happened," the race of the
pious is now suffering persecution, being driven
about in Asia by new decrees.
For the shame
less informers and coveters of the property of
others, taking occasion from the decrees, openly
carry on robbery night and day, despoiling those
who are guilty of no wrong." And a little further
on he says: "If these things are done by thy

never take unjust measures; and we indeed
gladly accept the honor of such a death. But
this request alone we present to thee, that
thou wouldst thyself first examine the authors
of such strife, and justly judge whether they be
worthy of death and punishment, or of safety
and quiet.
But if, on the other hand, this coun
sel and this new decree, which is not fit to be
executed even against barbarian enemies, be not
from thee, much more do we beseech thee not
to leave us exposed to such lawless plundering
by the populace."

Again he adds the following:* "For our
philosophy formerly flourished among the
Barbarians; but having sprung up among the
nations under thy rule, during the great reign of
thy ancestor Augustus, it became to thine empire
especially a blessing of auspicious omen.
For
from that time the power of the Romans has
grown in greatness and splendor. To this power
thou hast succeeded, as the desired possessor,"
and such shalt thou continue with thy son, if
thou guardest the philosophy which grew up with
the empire and which came into existence with
Augustus; that philosophy which thy ancestors
also honored along with the other religions.
And a most convincing proof that our
doctrine flourished for the good of an em
pire happily begun, is this - that there has no
evil happened since Augustus' reign, but that,
on the contrary, all things have been splendid
and glorious, in accordance with the prayers
of all.

suaded by certain calumniators, have wished
to slander our doctrine, and from them it has
come to pass that the falsehood * has been

24 o: statement of Melito's is a very remarkable one. See
is The resemblance between this extract from Melito's so
and the fifth chapter of Tertullian's Apology is close enough to b
striking, and too close to be accidental. Tertullian's chapter is
quite different from this, so far as its arrangement and language are
Concerned, but the same thought underlies both : That the emperors in
general have protected Christianity; only Nero and Domitian, the
most wicked of them, have persecuted it; and that Christianity has
been a blessing to the reigns of all the better emperors. We cannot
doubt that Tertullian was acquainted with Melito's 4Aology, as well
as with others of his works.

Melito refers here to the canonical Book of Ezra, which, among the
Jews, commonly included our Ezra and Nehemiah (see Bk. III.
chap. 10, note 1).

1 The first extant notice of Apolinarius is that of Serapion, bishop
of Antioch from about 192 to
(see Harnack, Zeit des /gnators,
p. 46), in the epistle quotedo in V. 19. We learn from
this notice that Apolinarius was already dead when Serapion wrote
(he calls him "most blessed bishop"; usakaporaros), and that he
had been a skillsul opponent of Montanism.
His name is not men
tioned again, so far as we know, by any Father of the second or third
century. Jerome (de vir. ii. 26) simply repeats, the account of
Eusebius, but in his Epist. ad Magnum, c. 4 (Migne, I. 607), he
enumerates Apolinarius among those Christian writers who were
acquainted with heathen literature, and made use of it in the refuta
Photius o, 14) praises his literary style in high
tion of heresies.
Socrates (H. E. III. 7) names Apolinarius with Irenaeus,
terms.
Clement of Alexandria, and Serapion as holding that the incarnate
Christ had a human soul (ou lovyov Tov čvaveport no avta). Jerome,
in his de vir. o. chap. 18, mentions an Apolinarius in connection
with Irenaeus as a chiliast.
But in his Comment. in Azech. Bk. XI.
chap. 36, he speaks of Irenaeus as the first, and Apolinarius as the
last, of the Greek Millenarians, which shows that some other Apoli
narius is meant in that place, and therefore without doubt in the
former passage also; and in another place (Prooem. in sið. A 1 ///.
Comm. in Esaia m) he says that Apolinarius replied to Dionysius
of Alexandria on the subject of the Millenium, and we are therefore
led to conclude that Apolinarius, bishop of Laodicea (of the fourth
century), is meant (see Routh, Rel, Sac. I. 174). Of the bishops of
Hierapolis, besides Apolinarius, we know only Papias and Abircius
Marcellus (of whom we have a Martyrdom, belonging to the second
..". see Pitra, Soir. Solesm. III. 533), who, if he be identical
with the Abircius Marcellus of Eusebius, Bk. V. chap. 16 (as Har
nack conjectures) must have been bishop after, not before Apolina
rius (see note 6 on Bk. V. chap. 16).
It is impossible to determine
the exact date of Apolinarius' episcopate, or of his death. As we
see from Serapion's notice of him, he must have been dead at least
before 202. And if Abircius Marcellus was bishop after him, and
also bishop in the second century, Apolinarius must have died some
'ears before the year 200, and o about the same time as Melito.
The fact that he is mentioned so commonly in connection with Melito,
sometimes before and sometimes aster him, confirms this conclusion.
The Chron. mentions him as flourishing in the tenth (Syncellus and
Jerome), or the eleventh (Armenian) year of Marcus Aurelius. His
Apology was addressed, as we learn from Eusebius, to Marcus Aure
lius; and the fact that only the one emperor is mentioned may perhaps
be taken (as some have taken it) as a sign that it was written while
Marcus Aurelius was sole emperor (i.e. between 169 and 176).
In
Bk. V. chap. 5, Eusebius speaks of the story of the thundering
legion as loss by Apolinarius, and it has been thought (e.g. by
Salmon, in the Dict, of Christ. Bivo.) that this circumstance was

I. addition to the ones
there were many others extant in his day.
mentioned by Eusebius, we know of a work of his, On the Pass
over (repi too marxa), which is mentioned by the Chron. Paschale,
and two brief fragments of which are preserved by it. These frag
ments have caused a discussion as to whether Apolinarius was a
Quartodeciman or not. The language of the first fragment would
seem to show clearly that he was opposed to the}.
and this explains the fact that he is never cited by the later Quarto
decimans as a witness for their opinions. The tone of the work, how
ever, as gathered from the fragments, shows that it must have been
written before the controversy had assumed the bitter tone which it
took when Victor became bishop of Rome; i.e. it was written, prob
ably, in the seventies (see, also, Bk. V. chap. 23, note 1).
Photius
(Cod. 14) mentions three apologetic works by Apolinarius known to
him: mpos "EAAnzas, Tepi evoreBetas, and nepi &Ambetas. The first and
last are mentioned by Eusebius, but the second is a work otherwise
unknown to us. There is no reason to suppose, as some have done,
that the Tepi evarefleias does not designate a separate work (cf. e.g.,
Donaldson, //ist. of Christ. Lit. and Doctrine, III. 243) §:
Eusebiuso . that he mentions only a part of Apolina
rius' writings.
Theodoret (Haer. Fab. I. 21) mentions Apolinarius,
together with Musanus and Clement, as having written against the
Severians (see chap. 29, below). But, as Harnack justly remarks
(p. 235), the most we can conclude from this is, that Apolinarius, in
his Anti-Montanistic work, had mentioned the Severians with disap

nack suggests that they were inserted under the influence of Bk.V.

quite probable that he wrote many others.

* On the approximate date of this Apology, see the previous
note. No fragments of the work are now extant, unless the ac
count of the thundering legion mentioned by Eusebius in Bk. V.
chap. 5 belong to it (see the previous note). Jerome speaks of the
work as an insigne volumen ero side Christianorum, and in chap.
26, § 1, Eusebius speaks of it as Aéyos unrep rins tria rews.
This
has given rise to the idea that the top eigeBoas mentioned by
Photius may be identical with this Apology (see the previous note).
But such an important work would certainly not have been men
tioned with such an ambiguous title by Photius. We, may, con
clude, in fact, that Photius had not seen the Apology. . The Chron.
Paschale mentions the Apology in
of
"Melito and many others," as addressed to the Emperor Marcus
Aurelius.

(H. E. IV. 11) says that it was in the form of a dialogue, and it is

in Cod. 14 (see Harmack, p. 236).

* No fragments of this work are extant, and its nature is un
known to us.
It may have resembled the work of Melito upon the
same subject (see the previous chapter). The work is mentioned
by Photius as one of three, which he had himself seen.

* Eusebius states here that the works against the Montanists
were written later than the other works mentioned. Where he got
this information we do not know; it is possible, as Harnack sug
gests, that he saw from the writings themselves that Marcus Aurelius
was no longer alive when they were composed.
Eusebius speaks
very highly of these Anti-Montanistic works, and in Bk. V. chap. 16,
§ 1, he speaks of Apolinarius as a "powerful weapon and antago
nist" of the Montanists. And yet it is a remarkable fact that he
does not take his account of the Montanists from the works of Apoli
narius, but from later writings. This fact can be explained only as
Harnack explains it by supposing that Apolinarius was not decided
and clear enough in his opposition to the sect. . The writer from
whom Eusebius quotes is certainly strong enough in his denuncia
tions to suit Eusebius or any one else.
Eusebius' statement, that
the Montanistic movement was only beginning at the time Apolina
rius wrote against it (i.e. according to him between 175 and 180),
i. far from the truth (see on this subject, Bk. V. chap. 16, note 12).
How many of these works Apolinarius wrote, and whether they
Eusebius says
were books, or merely letters, we do not know.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

Musanus and his Isritings.

AND as for Musanus,' whom we have mentioned
among the foregoing writers, a certain very ele
gant discourse is extant, which was written by
him against some brethren that had gone over
to the heresy of the so-called Encratites," which
had recently sprung up, and which introduced a
strange and pernicious error.
It is said that
Tatian was the author of this false doctrine.

CHAPTER XXIX.

The Heresy of Tatian."

HE is the one whose words we quoted
a little above * in regard to that admirable

simply kai 3 perä raúra avvéypale.
Serapion (in Eusebius, Bk. V.
chap. 19) calls them Ypsiupata, which Jerome (de vir, ill, chap.41)
translates litteras. #. Ypakumara are taken as "letters" by
Valesius, Stroth, Danz, and Salmon; but Otto contends that the
word Ypsiunara, in the usage of Eusebius (cf. Eusebius, V. 28.4),
properly means "writings" or "books" (scripta or libri), not
"letters," and so the word is translated by Closs. The word itself
is not absolutely decisive, but it is more natural to translate it
"writings," and the circumstances of the case seem to favor that
rather than the rendering "letters."
I have therefore translated it
thus in Bk. VI. chap. 19. On the life and writings of Apolinarius,
see especially Salmon's article in the Dict. of Christ. Biog, and Har
nack's Terfe und. Untersuch. I. 1, 232-239. The few extant frag
ments of his works are published by §§ (I. 151-174), and by
Otto (IX. 479-495); English translation in the Ante-Mocene Fathers,
VIII. 772.

* Of this Musanus, we know only what Eusebius, tells us here,
for Jerome (de vir, ill. 31) and Theodoret (Haer. Fač..I. 21) simply
repeat the account of Eusebius.
It is clear from Eusebius' language,
that he had not himself seen this work of Musanus; he had simply
heard of it.
Here, and in chap. 21, Eusebius assigns the activity of
Musanus to the reign of Marcus Aurelius, making him a contempo
rary of Melito, Apolinarius, Irenaeus, &c.
But in the Chron, he is
put much later. The Armenian version, under the year of Abr.
scriptor cognoscebatur. . under the same year (2220 of
2220 (the eleventh year of Septimius), has the entry Musanus nester
everus) has Musamus mostrar filosofar

scriptor agnoscitur, while Syncellus, under the year of Abr. 2231
fourth year of Caracalla) has Mowatavos éxxAmg taotixos avy Ypgdeus
&yvopišero.
All of them, therefore, speak of Musanus (or Musia
nus) as a writer, but do not specify any of his works. The dates in
the Chron. (whichever be taken as original) and in the History are
not mutually exclusive; at the same time it is clear that Eusebius was
not working upon the same information, in the two cases. We have
no means of testing the correctness of either statement.

* Qn Tatian and the Encratites, see the next chapter.
1 From his Oratio (chap. 42) we learn that Tatian was born in
Assyria, and that he was early educated in Greek philosophy, from
which we may conclude that he was of Greek parentage, - a con
clusion confirmed by the general tone of the Oratio (cf. Harnack,
Ueberlieserung der Griech. Apol. p. 199 sq., who refutes Zahn's
opinion that Tatian was a Syrian by race). We learn from his
Oratio also that he was converted to Christianity in mature life (cf.
chap. 29 sq.). From the passage quoted in the present chapter from
Irenaeus, we learn that Tatian, after the death of Justin (whos; dis
ciple he was; see also chap. 16, above), sell into heresy, and the
general fact is confirmed by Tertullian, Hippolytus, Clement of
Alexandria, Origen, and others.
Beyond these meager notices, we
have little information in regard to Tatian's life. Rhodo (quoted ill
Bk. V. chap. 13, below), mentions him, and " confesses' that he
was a pupil of Tatian's in Rome, perhaps implying that this was
after Tatian had left the Catholic Church (though inasmuch as the
word "confesses" is Eusebius', not Rhodo's, we can hardly lay
the stress that Harmack does upon its use in this connection). Epi

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[IV. 29.

man, Justin, and whom we stated to have been
a disciple of the martyr.
Irenaeus declares this
in the first book of his work Against Heresies,
where he writes as follows concerning both
him and his heresy: * "Those who are
called Encratites," and who sprung from
phanius gives quite an account of Tatian in his Harr. XLVI. 1, but
as usual he falls into grave errors (especially in his chronology).
The only trustworthy information that can be gathered from him is
that Tatian, after becoming a Christian, returned to Mesopotamia
and taught for a while there (see Harnack, ibid., p. 208 sq.). We
learn from his Oratio that he was already in middle life at the time
when he wrote it, i.e. about 152 A.D. (see note 13, below), and as a
consequence it is commonly assumed that he cannot have
rn
oil. than 11o A.D. Eusebius in his Chron. (XII. year of Mar
cus Aurelius, 172 A.D.) says, Tatianus harretirus agnoscitur, a yuo
Encratitae. There is no reason to doubt that this represents with
reasonable accuracy the date of Tatian's break with the Catholic
Church. We know at any rate that it did not take place until after
Justin's death (165 A.D.).
In possession of these various facts in
regard to Tatian, his life has been constructed in various ways by
historians, but Harnack seems to have come nearest to the truth in
his account of him on p. 212 sq. He holds that he was converted
about 150, but soon Woes for the Orient, and while there
wrote his Oratio ad Graecos; that afterward he returned to Rome,
and was an honored teacher in the Church for some time, but finally
becoming heretical, broke with the Church about the year 172. The
arguments which Harnack urges over against Zahn (who maintains
that he was but once in Rome, and ...i. became a heretic in the
Orient and spent the remainder of his life there) seem fully to estab
lish his main positions. Of the date, place, and circumstances of
Tatian's death, we know nothing.

Eusebius informs us in this chapter that Tatian left "a great
many writings," but he mentions the titles of only two, the Address
to the Greeks and the Diatessaron (see below, notes 11 and 13).
He seems, however, in § 6, to refer to another work on the Pauline
Epistles, - a work of which we have no trace anywhere else, though
we learn from Jerome's preface to his Commentary on Titus that
Tatian rejected some of Paul's epistles, as Marcion did, but unlike
Marcion accepted the epistle to Titus. We know the titles of some
other works written by Tatian. He himself, in his Oratro 15, men
tions a work which he had written On A nomads. The work is no
longer extant, nor do we know anything about it. Rhodo (as we are
told by Eusebius in Bk. V. chap. 13) mentioned a book of Problems
which Tatian had written. Of this, too, all traces have perished.
Clement of Alexandria (Strome. III. 12) mentions an heretical work
of Tatian's, entitled mept too Karā Tov orwornpa karapt to uod, On
Perfection according to the Saviour, which has likewise perished.
Clement (as also Origen) was evidently acquainted with still other
heretical works, especially one on Genesis (see below, note 7), but
he mentions the title only of the one referred to.
Rufinus (A. E.
VI. 11) says that Tatian composed a Chronicon, which we hear
about from no other writer.
Malalas calls Tatian a chronographer,
but he is evidently thinking of the chronological passages in his
Oratio, and in the absence of all trustworthy testimony we must
reject Rufinus' notice as a mistake.
In his Oratio, chap. 4o, Tatian
speaks of a work Against those who have discoursed on Divine
Things, in which he intends to show "what the learned among the
Greeks have said concerning our polity and the history of our ão
and how many and what kind of men have written of these things."
Whether he ever wrote the work or not we do not know; we find no
other notice of it. Upon Tatian, see especially Zahn's Tatian's />ia
tessaro and Harnack's (Večer/te/erring, &c., p. 196; also Donald
son's Hist., of Christ. Lot. and Doct. II. p. 3 sqq., and J. M.
Fuller's article in the Dict. of Christ. Biog.

* Irenaeus, Adzo. Haer. I. 28. 1.

* In chap. 16.
* "Eykpatets, a word meaning "temperate" or "continent."
These Encratites were heretics who abstained from flesh, from wine,
and from marriage, not temporarily but permanently, and because
of a belief in the essential impurity of those things. They are men
tioned also by Hippolytus (Pho. VIII. 13), who calls them dykpa
Tirai ; by Clement of Alexandria (Pard. II. 2, Strom. I. 15, &c.),
who calls them yopatnraç; by Epiphanius (Harr. 47), who agrees
with Hippolytus in the form of the name, and by others. The
Encratites whom Irenaeus describes seem to have constituted a dis
tinct sect, anti-Jewish and Gnostic in its character. As described
by Hippolytus they appear to have been mainly orthodox in doctrine
but heretical in their manner of life, and we may perhaps gather the
same thing from Clement's references to them.
It is evident, there
fore, that Irenaeus and the others are not referring to the same men.
So Theodoret, Harr. Faë. I. 21, speaks of the Severian Encratites;
but the Severians, as we learn from this chapter of Eusebius and
from Epiphanius (Harr. XLV.), were Ebionitic and anti-Pauline in
their tendencies - the exact opposites, therefore, of the Encratites
referred to by Irenaeus. That there was a distinct sect of Encratites
of the character described by Irenaeus cannot be denied, but we must
certainly conclude that the word was used very commonly in a wider
sense to denote men of various schools who taught excessive and
heretical abstinence. Of course the later writers may have supposed
that they all belonged to one compact sect, but it is certain that
they did not. As to the particular sect which Irenaeus describes,
the statement made by Eusebius at the close of the preceding chap

Saturninus" and Marcion, preached celibacy,
setting aside the original arrangement of God
and tacitly censuring him who made male and
female for the propagation of the human race.
They introduced also abstinence from the things
called by them animate," thus showing ingratitude
to the God who made all things. And they
But
deny the salvation of the first man.'
this has been only recently discovered by
them, a certain Tatian being the first to intro
duce this blasphemy. He was a hearer of Jus
tin, and expressed no such opinion while he was
with him, but after the martyrdom of the latter
he left the Church, and becoming exalted with
the thought of being a teacher, and puffed up
with the idea that he was superior to others, he
established a peculiar type of doctrine of his
own, inventing certain invisible aeons like the
followers of Valentinus," while, like Marcion and
Saturninus, he pronounced marriage to be cor
ruption and fornication.
His argument against
the salvation of Adam, however, he devised for

ter is incorrect, if we are to accept Irenaeus' account.
For the pas
sage quoted in this chapter states that they sprung from Marcion
and Saturninus, evidently implying that they were not founded by
Tatian, but that he sound them already in existence when he became
heretical.
It is not surprising, however, that his name should be
come connected with them as their sounder - for he was the best
known man among them. That the Encratites as such (whether a
single sect or a general tendency) should be opposed by the Fathers,
even by those .#. tendencies, was natural. It was not always
easy to distinguish between orthodox and heretical asceticism, and
yet there was felt to be a difference. The fundamental distinction
was held by the Church - whenever it came to self-consciousness
on the subject - to lie in the fact that the heretics pronounced the
things from which they abstained essentially evil in themselves,
thus holding a radical dualism, while the orthodox abstained only as
a matter of discipline. . The distinction, it is true, was not always
preserved, but it was this essentially dualistic principle of the En
cratites which the early Fathers combated; it is noticeable, however,
that they do not expend as much vigor in combating it as in refuting
errors in doctrine. }. fact, they seem themselves to have been some
what in doubt as to the proper attitude to take toward these extreme
ascetics.

* On Saturninus and on Marcion, see chap. 7, note 6, and 11,

" Tov Aeyouévov ću svkov: i.e. animal food in general.
7 Cs. Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. III. 23, where this opinion of Tatian's
is refuted at considerable length. The opinion seems a little peculiar,
but was a not unnatural consequence of Tatian's strong dualism,
and of his doctrine of a conditional immortality for those who have
been reunited with the Holy Spirit, who took his departure at the
time of the fall (cf. oil, his Oratio, chap. 15).
That Adam,
who, by his fall, brought about this separation, which has been of
such direful consequence to the race, should be saved, was naturally
to Tatian a very repugnant thought. He seems, moreover, to have
based his opinion, as Donaldson remarks, upon exegetical grounds,
interpreting the passage in regard to Adam (1 Cor. xv. 22) as mean
ing that Adam is and remains the principle of death, and as such, of
course, cannot himself enjoy life (see Irenaeus, oid.). This is quite
in accord with the distinction between the psychical and physical man
which he draws in his Oratio.
It is quite possible that he was
moved in part also by the same motive which led Marcion to deny
the salvation of Abraham and the other patriarchs (see Irenaeus,
Adv. Pfarr. I. 27 and IV. 8), namely, the opposition between the
God of the Old Testament and the Christ of the New Testament,
which led him to assert that those who depended on the former were
lost. We learn from Clement (Strome. III. 12) and from Origen
(de Orat. chap. 24) that among Tatian's heretical works was one in
which he discussed the early chapters of Genesis, and perhaps it was
in this work that he developed his peculiar views in regard to Adam.
That Tatian was Gnostic
in many of his tendencies is plain enough, not only from these words
of Irenaeus, but also from the notices of him in other writers (cf.
especially Hippolytus, Phil. VIII. 9). To what extent he carried
his Gnosticism, however, and exactly in what it consisted, we cannot
tell. He can hardly have been a pronounced follower of Valentinus
and a zealous defender of the doctrine of AEons, or we should find
him connected more prominently with that school. He was, in fact,
a decided eclectic, and a follower of no one school, and doubtless
this subject, like many others, occupied but a subordinate place in
his speculations.

* That the Severians, whoever they were, were Encratites in the
wide sense, that is, strict abstainers from flesh, wine, and marriage,
cannot be denied (compare with this description of Eusebius that of
Epiphanius in Harr. XLV., also Theodoret's Harr. Fab. I. 21, who
says that Apolinarius wrote against the Severian Encratites, - a
sign that the Severians and the Encratites were in some way con
nected in tradition even though Theodoret's statement may be unre
liable).
But that they were connected with Tatian and the Encra
titic sect to which he belonged, as Eusebius states, is quite out of the
question. Tatian was a decided Paulinist (almost as much so as Mar
cion himself). He cannot, therefore, have had anything to do with
this Ebionitic, anti-Pauline sect, known as the Severians. Whether
there was ever such a person as Severus, or whether the name arose
later to explain the name of the sect (possibly taken from the Latin
severus, "severe," as Salmon, suggests), as the name Ebion was
invented to explain the term Ebionites, we do not know. We are
ignorant also of the source from which Eusebius took his description
of the Severians, as we do not find them mentioned in any of the
earlier anti-heretical works.
Eusebius must have heard, as Epipha
nius did, that they were extreme ascetics, and this must have led
him, in the absence of specific information as to their exact position,
to join them with Tatian and the Encratites, - a connection which
can be justified on no other ground.

Af.er. XLVI. 1 incorrectly identifies it with the Gospel according
to the Hebrews, evidently knowing it only by hearsay.
Theodoret
(Harr. Fab. I. 20) informs us that he found a great many copies of
it in circulation in his diocese, and that, finding that it omitted the
account of our Lord's birth, he replaced it by the four Gospels, fear
ing the mischief which must result from the use of such a mutilated
Gospel. In the Doctrine of Addai (ed. Syr. and Engl. by G. Phillips,
1876), which belongs to the third century, a Diatessaron is men
tioned which is without doubt to be identified with the one under
consideration (see Zahn I. §: 90 sq.). Meanwhile we learn from the
preface to Dionysius bar Salibi's Commentary on Mark (see Asse

This work is
still extant, and is one of the most interesting of the early apologies.
The standpoint of the author is quite different from that of Justin,
for he treats Greek philosophy with the grèatest contempt, and finds
nothing good in it. As remarked in note 1, above, the Oratio was
probably written after Tatian had left Rome for the first time, but
not long after his conversion. We may follow Harnack (p. 196) in fix
ing upon 152 to 153 as an approximate date. The work is printed with
a Latin translation and commentary in Otto's Corp. AAol. Vol. VI.
The best critical edition is that of Schwartz, in v. Gebhardt and
Harnack's Terte und. Untersuch ungen, IV. 1 (Leipzig, 1888),
though it contains only the Greek text. An English translation is
given in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. II. p. 59-83.

* Tatian devotes a number of chapters to this subject (XXXI.,
XXXV.-XLI.). Eusebius mentions him, with Clement, Africanus,
Josephus, and Justus, in the preface to his Chron. (Schöne, II. p. 4),
as a witness to the antiquity of Moses, and it is probable that Julius
Africanus drew from him in the composition of his chronological
work (cf. Harnack, toid'. p. 224). Clement of Alexandria likewise
made large use of his chronological results (see especially his
Strom. I. 21), and Origen refers to them in his Contra Cels. I. 16.
It was largely on account of these chapters on the antiquity of
Moses that Tatian's Oratio was held in such high esteem, while his
other works disappeared.

he was at first a distinguished Christian teacher, but afterward be

Eusebius on the

left that sect and directed his attacks against it. Moses of Chorene
gives a similar account. To Hippolytus he appeared as a member
of the Eastern school of Valentinians, while to Ephraem the Syrian
he seemed in general one of the most pernicious of heretics, who
nevertheless pretended to be orthodox, veiling his errors in ambigu
ous language, and thus carrying away many of the faithful. Accord
ing to Hort, who has given the subject very careful study, "there
is no reason to suppose that Bardesanes rejected the ordinary faith
of the Christians as founded on the Gospels and the writings of the
apostles, except on isolated points. The more startling peculiarities
of which we hear belong for the most part to an outer region of
speculation, which it may o have seemed possible to combine
with Christianity, more especially with the undeveloped Christianity
of Syria in the third century. The local color is everywhere promi
nent.
In passing over to the new faith Bardaisan could not shake
off the ancient glamour of the stars, or abjure the Semitic love of
clothing thoughts in mythological forms." This statement explain;
clearly enough the reputation for heresy which Bardesanes enjoyed
in subsequent generations....There is no reason to think that he
taught a system of aeons, like the Gnostics, but he does seem to

contains an excellent discussion of the subject, and the student is
referred to that.

The followers of Bardesanes seem to have emphasized those points
in which he differed with the Church at large, and thus to have de
parted further from catholic orthodoxy. Undoubtedly Ephraem
(who is our most important authority for a knowledge of Bardesanes)
knows him only through his followers, who were very numerous
throughout the East in the fourth century, and hence passes a
harsher judgment upon him than he might otherwise have done.

Eusebius in this chapter, followed by Jerome (de for. o. chap.

desanes to the reign of Marcus Aurelius (so also in the Chron.).
But Hort says that according to the Chronicle of Edessa (Assemani,
Bibl. Or. I. 389) he was born July 11, 155, and according to Bar
hebraeus (Chron. Eccl. ed., Abbéloos and Lamy, p. 49) he died in 223
at the age of sixty-eight, which confirms the date of his birth given by

VI.) an Apology "in which he resisted Apollonius, the companion
of Antoninus, when urged to deny that he was a Christian." This
was probably one of the many works which Eusebius says he wrote
on occasion of the persecution which arose at the time.

says that in
this work he "copiously refuted Avidas the astrono

confusion of the names Avidas and Antoninus, for it is difficult to
conceive that the work can have been addressed to an emperor, and
in any case it cannot have been addressed to Marcus Aurelius, whom
Eusebius here means. This 19talogue on Fate is identified either

A fragment of this work is given in Eusebius' Prao. Ezang. W1.

this was all that we had of it. This is undoubtedly the work
referred to by Eusebius, Epiphanius, and other Fathers, but it is no
less certain that it was not written by Bardesanes himself. As Hort
remarks, "the natural impulse to confuse the author with the chies

INTRODUCTION.

SoTER," bishop of the church of Rome,
died after an episcopate of eight years, and
was succeeded by Eleutherus," the twelfth from
the apostles.
In the seventeenth year of the
Emperor Antoninus Verus," the persecution of
our people was rekindled more fiercely in certain
districts on account of an insurrection of the
masses in the cities; and judging by the number
in a single nation, myriads suffered martyrdom
throughout the world. A record of this was
written for posterity, and in truth it
is
worthy of perpetual remembrance. A full

* Eusebius in his Chronicle gives the ğ. of Eleutherus' acces
sion as the seventeenth year of Marcus Aurelius (177 A.D.), and
puts his death into the reign of Pertinax (192), while in chap. 22 of
the present book he places his death in the tenth year of Commodus
(189). Most of our authorities agree in assigning fifteen years to
his episcopate, and this may be accepted as undoubtedly correct.
Most of them, moreover, agree with chap. 22 of this book, in assign
ing his death to the tenth year of Commodus, and this too may be
accepted as accurate. . But with these two data we are obliged to
Fo his accession back into the year 7%. 175), which is accepted
y Lipsius (see his Chron. der röm. Bischüse, p. 184 sq.). We
must therefore suppose that he became bishop some two years be
fore the outbreak of the persecution referred to just below, in the
fourteenth or fifteenth year of Marcus Aurelius.
In the Armenian
version of the Chron. Eleutherus is called the thirteenth bishop of
Rome (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 19, note 5), but this is a mistake,
as pointed out in the note referred to.
Eleutherus is mentioned in
Bk. IV. chap. 11, in connection with Hegesippus, and also in Bk.
IV. chap. 22, by Hegesippus, himself.
e is chiefly interesting
because of his connection with Irenaeus and the Gallican martyrs
(see chap. 4, below), and his relation to the Montanistic contro
versy (see chap. 3).
Bede, in his Hist. Eccles., chap. 4, connects
Eleutherus with the origin of British Christianity, but the tradition
is quite groundless. One of the decretals and a spurious epistle are
falsely ascribed to him.

* i.e., the seventeenth year of the reign of Marcus Aurelius, A.D.
177 (upon Eusebius' confusion of Marcus Aurelius with Lucius
Verus, see below, p. 390, note).
In the Chron, the persecution
at Lyons and Vienne is associated with the seventh year of Marcus
Aurélius (167), and consequently some (e.g. Blondellus, Stroth, and
Jachmann), have maintained that the notice in the present passage
is incorrect, and Jachmann has attacked Eusebius very severely for
the supposed error. The truth is, however, that the notice in the
Chron. (in the Armenian, which represents the original form more
closely than Jenner's version does) is not placed opposite the seventh
year of Marcus Aurelius (as the notices in the Chron: commonl
Are), but is placed after it, and grouped with the notice of Polycarp's
martyrdom, which occurred, not in 167, but in 155 or 156 (see above,
Bk. IV. chap. 15, note 2). . It would seem, as remarked by Light
foot (/onatius, i.
. 630), that Eusebius simply connected together
the martyrdoms which he o occurred about this time, with
out intending to imply that they all took place in the same year.
Similar groupings of kindred events which occurred at various times
during the reign of an emperor are quite common in the Chron:
(cf. the notices of martyrdoms under Trajan and of apologies and
rescripts under Hadrian). Over against the distinct statement of
the history, therefore, in the present instance, the notice in the
Chron. is of no weight.
Moreover, it is clear from the present
passage that Eusebius had strong grounds for putting the persecution
into the time of Eleutherus, and the letter sent by the confessors to
Eleutherus (as recorded below in chap. 4) gives us also good reason
for putting the persecution into the time of his episcopate. But
Eleutherus cannot have become bishop before 174 (see Lipsius'
Chron. der röm. Bischoose, p. 184 sq., and note 2, above). There
is no reason, therefore, for doubting the date given here by Eusebius.

-

account, containing the most reliable informa
tion on the subject, is given in our Collection
of Martyrdoms," which constitutes a narrative
instructive as well as historical.
I will repeat
here such portions of this account as may be
needful for the present purpose.

Other writers of history record the victo
ries of war and trophies won from enemies,
the skill of generals, and the manly bravery of
soldiers, defiled with blood and with innumer
able slaughters for the sake of children and
country and other possessions.
But our
narrative of the government of God" will
record in ineffaceable letters the most peaceful
wars waged in behalf of the peace of the soul,
and will tell of men doing brave deeds for truth
rather than country, and for piety rather than
dearest friends.
It will hand down to imperish
able remembrance the discipline and the much
tried fortitude of the athletes of religion, the
trophies won from demons, the victories over
invisible enemies, and the crowns placed upon
all their heads.

This word is used in this and the following chap
ters of all those that suffered in the persecution, whether they lost
their lives or not, and therefore in a broader sense than our word

In order, therefore, to avoid all ambiguity I have trans
lated the word in every case "witness," its original significance.
Upon the use of the words wiptup and uaprus in the early Church,
see Bk. III. chap. 32, note 15.

* The fragments of this epistle, preserved by Eusebius in this
and the next chapter, are printed with a commentary by Routh, in
his Re'. Sacrae. I. p. 285 sq., and an English translation is given in
the Ante-Niceme }.},. VIII. p. 778 sq.
There can be no
doubt as to the early date and reliability of the epistle.
It bears no
traces of a later age, and contains little of the marvelous, which
entered so largely into the spurious martyrologies of a later day. Its
enuineness is in fact questioned by no one so far as I am aware.
i. is one of the most beautiful works of the kind which we have, and
well deserves the place in his History which Eusebius has accorded
it. We may assume that we have the greater part of the epistle in
so far as it related to the martyrdoms. Ado, in his Mart., asserts
that forty-eight suffered martyrdom, and even gives a list of their
names. It is possible that he gained his information from the epistle
itself, as given in its complete form in Eusebius' Co.'section of J/ar
tyrdoms, but I am inclined to think rather that Eusebius has men
tioned if not all, at least the majority of the martyrs referred to in
the epistle, and that therefore Ado's list is largely imaginary. Euse
bius' statement, that a "multitude" suffered signifies nothing, for
u vpia was a very indefinite word, and might be used of a dozen or
fifteen as easily as of forty-eight. To speak of the persecution as
"wholesale," so that it was not safe for any Christian to appear out
of doors (Lightfoot, /gnatius, Vol. I. p. 499), is rather overstating
the case.
The persecution must, of course, whatever its extent,
appear terrible to the Christians of the region; but a critical exami
nation of the epistle itself will hardly justify the extravagant state
ments which are commonly made in regard to the magnitude and
severity of the persecution.
It may have been worse than any single
persecution that had preceded it, but sinks into insignificance when
compared with those which took place under Decius and Diocletian.
It is interesting to notice that this epistle was especially addressed
ans of Asia and Phrygia. We know that Southern
to the Ch
Gaul contained a great many Asia Šior people, and that the inter
course between the two districts was very close.
Irenaeus, and other
prominent Christians of Gaul, in the second and following centuries,
were either natives of Asia Minor, or had pursued their studies
there; and so the Church of the country always bore a peculiarly
Greek character, and was for some centuries in sympathy and in
constant communication with the Eastern Church.
Witness, for
instance, the rise and spread of semi-Pelagianism there in the fifth
century, - a simple reproduction in its main features of the anthro
pology of the Eastern Church.
Doubtless, at the time this epistle
was written, there were many Christians in Lyons and Vienne, who
had friends and relations in the East, and hence it was very natural
that an epistle should be sent to what might be called, in a sense,

was the author of this epistle; and he has been followed by man
other scholars.
It is possible that he was, but there are no grounds
upon which to base the opinion, except the fact that Irenaeus lived
in Lyons, and was, or afterward became, a writer. On the other
hand, it is significant that no tradition has connected the letter with
Irenaeus' name, and that even Eusebius has no thought of such a

against the servants of God, not only shutting
us out from houses and baths and markets, but
forbidding any of us to be seen in any
place whatever.
But the grace of God led
the conflict against him, and delivered the
weak, and set them as firm pillars, able through
patience to endure all the wrath of the Evil One.
And they joined battle with him, undergoing all
kinds of shame and injury; and regarding their
great sufferings as little, they hastened to Christ,
manifesting truly that ‘the sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which shall be revealed to
us-ward."
First of all, they endured nobly
the injuries heaped upon them by the popu
lace ; clamors and blows and draggings and rob
beries and stonings and imprisonments," and all
things which an infuriated mob delight in
inflicting on enemies and adversaries. Then,
being taken to the forum by the chiliarch"
and the authorities of the city, they were exam

and having confessed, they were imprisoned

It
may be that the mob did actually shut Christians up in one or an

that the Christians were obliged to avoid places of public resort and
were perhaps even compelled to remain somewhat closely at home,
and were thus in a sense "imprisoned."

* Of the various witnesses mentioned in this chapter (Vettius
Epagathus, Sanctus, Attalus, Blandina, Biblias, Pothinus, Maturus,
Alexander, Ponticus) we know only what this epistle tells us. The
question has arisen whether Vettius Epagathus really was a martyr.
Renan (Marc Aureole, p. 307) thinks that he was not even arrested,
but that the words "taken into the number of martyrs" (§ 10, be
low) imply simply that he enjoyed all the merit of martyrdom with
out actually undergoing any suffering. He bases his opinion upon
the fact that Wettius is not mentioned again among the martyrs
whose sufferings are recorded, and also upon the use of the words,
"He was and is a true disciple" (§ 19, below).
It is quite possible,
however, that Vettius, who is said to have been a man of high sta
tion, was simply beheaded as a Roman citizen, and therefore there
was no reason for giving a description of his death; and still further
the words, "taken into the order of witnesses," and also the words
used in § 10, "being well pleased to lay down his life," while they
do not prove that he suffered martyrdom, yet seem very strongly to
imply i. he did, and the quotation from the Apocalypse in the same
paragraph would seem to indicate that he was dead, not alive, at the
time the epistle was written. On the whole, it may be regarded as
probable, though not certain, that Vettius was one of the martyrs.
Walesius refers to Gregory of Tours (H. E. chaps. 29, 31) as mention
ing a certain senator who was "of the lineage of Vettius Epagathus,
who suffered for the name of Christ at Lyons." Gregory's authority
is not very great, and he may in this case have known no more
about the death of Vettius than is told in the fragment which we
still possess, so that his statement can hardly be urged as proof that

that the latter was of a noble family, a fact which is confirmed in
§ 10, below, where he is spoken of as a man of distinction.

Such being his
character, he could not endure the unreasonable

But those

"But Sanctus also endured marvelously
and superhumanly * all the outrages which
he suffered.
While the wicked men hoped, by
the continuance and severity of his tortures to
wring something from him which he ought not
to say, he girded himself against them with such
firmness that he would not even tell his name, or
the nation or city to which he belonged, or whether
he was bond or free, but answered in the Roman
tongue to all their questions, "I am a Christian.'
He confessed this instead of name and city and
race and everything besides, and the people
heard from him no other word. There arose
therefore on the part of the governor and
his tormentors a great desire to conquer him ;
but having nothing more that they could do
to him, they finally fastened red-hot brazen
plates to the most tender parts of his body.
And these indeed were burned, but he con
tinued unbending and unyielding, firm in his
confession, and refreshed and strengthened by
the heavenly fountain of the water of life,
flowing from the bowels of Christ. And
his body was a witness of his sufferings,
being one complete wound and bruise, drawn
out of shape, and altogether unlike a human
form.
Christ, suffering in him, manifested his
glory, delivering him from his adversary, and
making him an ensample for the others, show
ing that nothing is fearful where the love of the
Father is, and nothing painful where there
is the glory of Christ.
For when the wicked
men tortured him a second time after some
days, supposing that with his body swollen and
inflamed to such a degree that he could not
bear the touch of a hand, if they should again
apply the same instruments, they would over
come him, or at least by his death under his
sufferings others would be made afraid, not only
did not this occur, but, contrary to all human
expectation, his body arose and stood erect in the
midst of the subsequent torments, and resumed
its original appearance and the use of its limbs,

so that, through the grace of Christ, these sec

healing.

"But the devil, thinking that he had al
ready consumed Biblias, who was one of
those who had denied Christ, desiring to in
crease her condemnation through the utterance
of blasphemy," brought her again to the torture,
to compel her, as already feeble and weak,
to report impious things concerning us. But
she recovered herself under the suffering,
and as if awaking from a deep sleep, and re
minded by the present anguish of the eternal
punishment in hell, she contradicted the blas
phemers.
‘How," she said, ‘could those eat
children who do not think it lawful to taste the
blood even of irrational animals?' And thence
forward she confessed herself a Christian, and was
given a place in the order of the witnesses.
"But as the tyrannical tortures were
made by Christ of none effect through the
patience of the blessed, the devil invented other
contrivances, - confinement in the dark and
most loathsome parts of the prison, stretching
of the feet to the fifth hole in the stocks," and
the other outrages which his servants are accus
tomed to inflict upon the prisoners when furious
and filled with the devil. A great many were
suffocated in prison, being chosen by the Lord
for this manner of death, that he might
manifest in them his glory.
For some,
though they had been tortured so cruelly
that it seemed impossible that they could live,
even with the most careful nursing, yet, desti
tute of human attention, remained in the prison,
being strengthened by the Lord, and invigorated
both in body and soul; and they exhorted and
encouraged the rest.
But such as were young,
and arrested recently, so that their bodies had
not become accustomed to torture, were unable
to endure the severity of their confinement, and
died in prison.

"The blessed Pothinus, who had been
entrusted with the bishopric of Lyons, was
dragged to the judgment seat. He was more than
ninety years of age, and very infirm, scarcely in
deed able to breathe because of physical weak
ness; but he was strengthened by spiritual zeal
through his earnest desire for martyrdom. Though
his body was worn out by old age and disease, his
life was preserved that Christ might triumph
in it. When he was brought by the soldiers to

For the joy of martyrdom, and the hope of

their consciences so greatly distressed the former
that they were easily distinguishable from all the

* The compassion of Jesus appeared not in the fact that those
who denied suffered such terrible punishments, but that the differ

faithful in theirs became a means of strength and encouragement to
the other Christians. Compare the note of Heinichen (III. p. 180).

But the blessed Blandina, last of all, having,
as a noble mother, encouraged her children
and sent them before her victorious to the King,
endured herself all their conflicts and hastened
after them, glad and rejoicing in her departure
as if called to a marriage supper, rather than

And, after the scourg
ing, after the wild beasts, after the roast

thrown before a bull. And having been tossed
about by the animal, but feeling none of the
things which were happening to her, on account
of her hope and firm hold upon what had been
entrusted
her, and her communion with
Christ, she also was sacrificed. And the heathen

of manly reason, the fact that they had been
conquered did not put them to shame, but rather
the more enkindled their wrath as that of a wild
beast, and aroused alike the hatred of governor
and people to treat us unjustly; that the Scrip
ture might be fulfilled : ‘He that is lawless, let
him be lawless still, and he that is righteous,
let him be righteous still.'"
For they cast
to the dogs those who had died of suffoca
tion in the prison, carefully guarding them by
night and day, lest any one should be buried by
us. And they exposed the remains left by the
wild beasts and by fire, mangled and charred,
and placed the heads of the others by their
bodies, and guarded them in like manner from
burial by a watch of soldiers for many days.
60 And some raged and gnashed their teeth
against them, desiring to execute more se
vere vengeance upon them; but others laughed
and mocked at them, magnifying their own
idols, and imputed to them the punishment of
the Christians.
Even the more reasonable, and
those who had seemed to sympathize somewhat,
reproached them often, saying, ‘Where is their
God, and what has their religion, which they
have chosen rather than life, profited them?"
So various was their conduct toward us; but
we were in deep affliction because we could

* The Christians were very solicitous about the bodies of the
martyrs, and were especially anxious to give them decent burial,
and to preserve the memory of their graves as places of peculiar re
ligious interest and sanctity. They sometimes went even to the
§ of bribing the officials to give them the dead bodies (cf. § 61,
* Rev. xxii. 11. The citation of the Apocalypse at this date as

Scripture (ova hypabn manpw85) is noteworthy.

not bury the bodies. For neither did night avail
us for this purpose, nor did money persuade, nor
entreaty move to compassion; but they kept
watch in every way, as if the prevention of the
burial would be of some great advantage to
them."

In addition, they say after other things:
"The bodies of the martyrs, having thus
in every manner been exhibited and ex
posed for six days, were afterward burned and
reduced to ashes, and swept into the Rhone
by the wicked men, so that no trace of
them might appear on the earth. And this
they did, as if able to conquer God, and
prevent their new birth; ‘that,' as they said,
‘they may have no hope of a resurrection,"
through trust in which they bring to us this
foreign and new religion, and despise terrible
things, and are ready even to go to death with
joy. Now let us see if they will rise again, and
if their God is able to help them, and to deliver
them out of our hands.'"

CHAPTER II.

The Martyrs, beloved of God, kindly ministered
unto those who fell in the Persecution.

SUCH things happened to the churches
of Christ under the above-mentioned em
peror," from which we may reasonably conjec
ture the occurrences in the other provinces.
It
is proper to add other selections from the same
letter, in which the moderation and compassion
of these witnesses is recorded in the following
words:

"They were also so zealous in their imitation of Christ, - ‘who, being in the form
of God, counted it not a prize to be on an equal
ity with God,"- that, though they had attained
such honor, and had borne witness, not once or
twice, but many times, - having been brought
back to prison from the wild beasts, covered
with burns and scars and wounds, - yet they
did not proclaim themselves witnesses, nor did
they suffer us to address them by this name.
If any one of us,
letter or conversation,
spoke of them as witnesses, they rebuked him

in

** These words show us how much emphasis the Christians of that
day must have laid upon the resurrection of the body (an emphasis
which is abundantly cvident from other sources), and in what a
sensuous and material way they must have taught the doctrine, or
at least how unguarded their teaching must have been, which could
lead the heathen to think that they could in the slightest impede the
resurrection by such methods as they pursued. The Christians, in
so far as they i.i. so much emphasis as they did upon the motorial
side of the doctrine, and were so solicitous about the burial of their
brethren, undoubtedly were in large part responsible for this gross
misunderstanding on the part of the heathen.

it may not be possible to produce any other examples of the use of

11 The question of the readmission of the lapsed had not yet be

(Avov) those who had shown weakness under persecution is similar
to that which caused so much dispute in the Church during and
after the persecution of Decius. See below, Bk. VI. chap. 43, note 1.

peace to us," they went in peace to God, leaving
no sorrow to their mother, nor division or strife
to the brethren, but joy and peace and concord
and love."

This record of the affection of those
blessed ones toward the brethren that had
fallen may be profitably added on account of
the inhuman and unmerciful disposition of those
who, after these events, acted unsparingly toward
the members of Christ."

It runs as follows: "For a certain Alci

austere life, partaking of nothing whatever but
bread and water. When he endeavored to con
tinue this same sort of life in prison, it was
revealed to Attalus after his first conflict in the
amphitheater that Alcibiades was not doing well
in refusing the creatures of God and placing
a stumbling-block before others. And Alcibiades obeyed, and partook of all things

the Holy Ghost was their counselor."
Let this
suffice for these matters.

phorus, and is supported by Rufinus and adopted by Stephanus,
Stroth, Burton, and Zimmermann. The majority of àe MSS., fol
lowed by all the other editors, including Heinichen, read diet.

14 Eusebius refers here to the Novatians, who were so severe in
their treatment of the lapsco, and who in his day were spread very
lo, and formed an aggressive and compact organization (see be
low, Bk. VI. chap. 43, note 1).
1 Of this Alcibiades we know only what is told us in this connec
tion.
Doubtless Eusebius sound this extract very much to his taste,
for we know that he was not inclined to asceticism. The enthusi
astic spirit of the Lyons Christians comes out strongly in the ex
tract, and considerable light is thrown by it upon the state of the
Church there.
Imprisoned confessors were never permitted to suffer
for want of food and the other comforts of life so long as their
brethren were allowed access to them. Compare e.g. Lucian's Pere
grinus Protests.

* On Montanus and the Montanists, see below, chap. 16 sq.
* Of this Montanist Alcibiades we know nothing. He is, of
course, to be distinguished from the confessor mentioned just above.
The majority of the editors of Eusebius substitute his name for that
of Miltiades in chap. 16, below, but the MSS. all read McArtáðmy, and
the emendation is unwarranted (see chap. 16, note 7). Salmon sug
gests that we should read Miltiades instead of Alcibiades in the pres
ent passage, supposing that the latter may have crept in through a
copyist's error, under the influence of the name Alcibiades men
tioned just above. Such an error is possible, but not probable (see
chap. 16, note 7).

and in chap. 16, below (see that chapter, note 25).

that, through the gift of God, were still wrought in
the different churches caused their prophesying to
be readily credited by many, - and as dissension
arose concerning them, the brethren in Gaul set
forth their own prudent and most orthodox judg
ment in the matter, and published also several
epistles from the witnesses that had been put to
death among them. These they sent, while they
were still in prison, to the brethren throughout
Asia and Phrygia, and also to Eleutherus," who
was then bishop of Rome, negotiating for the
peace of the churches."

CHAPTER IV.

Irenaeus commended by the Witnesses in a Letter.

THE same witnesses also recommended
Irenaeus,' who was already at that time a
presbyter of the parish of Lyons, to the above
mentioned bishop of Rome, saying many favor
able things in regard to him, as the following

extract shows:

"We pray, father Eleutherus, that you
may rejoice in God in all things and always.
We have requested our brother and comrade
Irenaeus to carry this letter to you, and we ask
you to hold him in esteem, as zealous for the
covenant of Christ.
For if we thought that office
could confer righteousness upon any one, we
should commend him among the first as a pres
byter of the church, which is his position."
Why should we transcribe the catalogue

* On Fleutherus, see above, Bk. V. Introd. note 2.
" It is commonly assumed that the Gallic martyrs favored the
Montanists and exhorted Eleutherus to be mild in his judgment of
them, and to preserve the peace of the Church by permitting them
to remain within it and enjoy fellowship with other Christians. But
Salmon (in the Doct. of Christian /3;og. III. p. 937) has shown, in
my opinion conclusively, that the Gallic confessors took the oppo
site side, and exhorted Eleutherus to confirm the Eastern Church in
its condemnation of the Montanists, representing to him that he
would threaten the peace of the Church by refusing to recognize the
justice of the decision of the bishops of the East, and by setting

tion with Asia Minor, we should expect the Gallic Christians to be
early informed of the state of affairs in the East, and it is not diffi
cult to think that they may have formed the same opinion in regard
to the new prophecy which the majority of their brethren there had
formed. T. decisive argument for §. opinion is the fact
that Eusebius calls the letter of the Lyons confessors to Eleutherus
"pious and most orthodox."
Certainly, looking upon Montanism
as one of the most execrable of heresies and as the work of Satan
himself (cf. his words in chap. 16, below), it is very difficult to sup
pose that he can have spoken of a letter written expressly in favor
of the Montanists in any such terms of respect. Salmon says: "It
is monstrous to imagine that Eusebius, thinking thus of Montanism,
could praise as pious or orthodox the opinion of men who, ignorant
of Satan's devices, should take the devil's work for God's. The way
in which we ourselves read the history is that the Montanists had
appealed to Rome; that the Church party solicited the good offices
of their countrymen settled in Gaul, who wrote to Eleutherus repre
senting the disturbance to the peace of the churches (a phrase prob
ably preserved by Eusebius from the letter itself) which would en
sue is the Roman Church should approve what the Church on the
spot had condemned. .
. To avert, then, the possibility of the
calamity of a breach between the Eastern and Western churches,
the Gallic churches, it would appear, not only wrote, but sent Ire
naeus to Rome at the end of 177 or the beginning of 178. The hy
pothesis here made relieves us #on the necessity of supposing this
mpeo Beta to have been unsuccessful, while it fully accounts for the
necessity of sending it."

For whoever desires

Such were

Eusebius here uses the common technical term
for confessors; i.e. for those who had been faithful and had suffered
in persecution, but had not lost their lives.
In the epistle of the
churches of Lyons and Vienne, the word oud Aoyot is used to denote
the same persons (see above, chap. 2, note 6).

* Cf. § 2 of the Introduction to this book (Bk. V.). On Euse

from Marcus Aurelius at the beginning of the next chapter. See
below, p. 390, note.

* The expression Aoyos Exet, employed here by Eusebius, is
ordinarily used by him to denote that the account which he subjoins
rests simply upon verbal testimony.
But in the present instance he
has written authority, which he mentions below. He seems, there
fore, in the indefinite phrase Aoyos exel, to express doubts which he
himself feels as to the trustworthiness of the account which he is
Christians' version of it soft, accepted by the Christians
about to give. The story was widely known in his time, and the
themselves with little misgiving, and yet he is too well informed
upon this subject to be ignorant of the fact that the common version
rests upon a rather slender foundation. He may have known of
the coins and monuments upon which the emperor had commemo
rated his own view of the matter, − at any rate '..e. was familiar with
the fact that all the heathen historians contradicted the claims of the
Christians, and hence he could not but consider it a questionable
matter. At the same time, the Christian version of the story was
supported by strong names and was widely accepted, and he, as a
good Christian, of course wished to accept it, if possible, and to
report it for the edification of posterity.

* It is an historical fact that, in 174 A.D., the Roman army in
Hungary was relieved from a very dangerous predicament by the
sudden occurrence of a thunder-storm, which quenched their thirst
and frightened the barbarians, and thus gave the Romans the vic
tory.
By heathen writers this event (quite naturally considered
miraculous) was held to have taken place in answer to prayer, but
by no means in answer to the prayers of the Christians.
Dion
Cassius (LXXI. 8) ascribes the supposed miracle to the conjurations
of the Egyptian magician Arnuphis; Capitolinus (I ota J/arc.
A to relry, chap. 24, and 1 ita //e/rosača'i, chap. 9), to the prayer of
Marcus Aurelius. The emperor himself expresses his view upon a
coin which represents Jupiter as hurling lightning against the bar
barians (see Eckhel. Mumism. III. 61).

As early as the time of Marcus Aurelius himself the Christians
ascribed the merit of the supposed miracle to their own prayers
(e.g. Apolinarius, mentioned just below), and this became the com
mon belief among them (cf. Tertullian, Apol. chap. \ quoted just
below, and ad Scap, chap. 4, and the forged edict of Marcus Aure

that . whole legion prayed for deliverance to their respective
deities, and thus quite naturally each party claimed the victory for
its particular gods. That there were some Christians in the army
of Marcus Aurelius there is, of course, no reason to doubt, but that
a legion at that time was wholly composed of Christians, as Euse.
bius implies, is inconceivable

our custom in prayer," and engaged in sup

This was indeed a
strange sight to the enemy, but it is re

lowed. The lightning drove the enemy to flight
and destruction, but a shower refreshed the
army of those who had called on God, all of
whom had been on the point of perishing with

thirst.

This story is related by non-Christian
writers who have been pleased to treat the
times referred to, and it has also been recorded
by our own people.'
By those historians who
were strangers to the faith, the marvel is men
tioned, but it is not acknowledged as an an
swer to our prayers.
But by our own people,
as friends of the truth, the occurrence is re
lated
in a simple and artless manner.

prayers the wonder took place received from

* Kneeling was the common posture of offering prayer in the

by the Nicene Council in its twentieth canon (Hesele, Concilien
gesch. I. 430).

* A6).os Exet. See above, note 1.
7 Dion Cassius and Capitolinus record the occurrence (as men
tioned above, note 2).
It is recorded also by other writers after
Eusebius' time, such as Claudian and Zonaras. None of them, how
ever, attribute the occurrence to the prayers of the Christians, but
all claim it for the heathen gods. The only pre-Eusebian Christian
accounts of this event still extant are those contained in the forged
edict of Marcus Aurelius and in the Apology of Tertullian, quoted
just below (cf. also his de Orat. 29).
Cyprian also probably refers
to the same event in his Tractat. ad Pemetriadem, 20. Eusebius,
in referring to Apolinarius, and Tertullian, very likely mentions all
the accounts with which he was acquainted.
Gregory Nyssa, Je
rome, and other later Christian writers refer to the event.

* i.e. Claudius Apolinarius, bishop of Hierapolis. Upon him
and his writings, see above, Bk. IV. chap. 27, note 1.
This reser
ence is in all probability to the Afology of Apolinarius, as this is
the only work !. to us which would have been likely to contain
an account of such an event. The fact that in the reign of the yery
ror under whom the occurrence took place, and in an Apology
addressed to him, the Christians could be indicated as the source of
the miracle, shows the firmness of this belief among the Christians
themselves, and also proves that they must have been so numerous
in the o, as to justify them in setting up a counter-claim over
against the heathen soldiers.
Apolinarius is very far from the truth in his statement as to the
name of the legion. From Dion Cassius, LV. 23, it would seem that
the legion bore this name even in the time of Augustus; but if this
be uncertain, at any rate it bore it as early as the time of Nero (as
we learn from an inscription of his eleventh year, Corp. /ns. Lat.
III. 30). Neander ... it improbable that Apolinarius, a contem
porary who lived in the neighborhood of the legion's winter quarters,
could have committed such a mistake. He prefers to think that the
error is Eusebius', and resulted from a too rapid perusal of the pas
sage in Apolinarius, where there must have st
some such words
as, ‘‘Now the emperor could with right call the legion the Thunder
ing Legion."
His opinion is at least plausible. Tertullian certainly
knew nothing of the naming of the legion at this time, or if he had
heard the report, rejected it.

succeeded him in the episcopate of the church

third book of his work Against Heresies he
has inserted a list of the bishops of Rome, bring
ing it down as far as Eleutherus (whose times
we are now considering), under whom he com
posed his work. He writes as follows:*

tion must be that received by the Roman, not by the Corinthian
church (as it is commonly understood), and hence it is necessary
to supply some verb which shall govern mapášog v, for it is at least
very harsh to say that the Roman church, in its epistle to the
Corinthians "renewed " the faith which it had received. The truth
is, that both in Rufinus and in Irenacus an extra participle is found
(in the former e.a.primens, in the latter a on untrans), and Stroth
has in consequence ventured to insert the word xarayye Aouara in his
text.
I have likewise, for the sake of the sense, inserted the word
Aroclaiming, not thereby intending to imply, however, the belief
that karayyeaovara stood in the original text of Eusebius.

* It is interesting to notice how strictly Eusebius carries out
his principle of taking historical matter wherever he can find it, but
of omitting all doctrinal statements and discussions. The few sen
tences which follow in Irenaeus are of a doctrinal nature, and in the
form of a brief polemic against Gnosticism.

THESE things Irenaeus, in agreement with
the accounts already given by us," records
in the work which comprises five books, and to
which he gave the title Refutation and Over
throw of the Knowledge Falsely So-called."
In
the second book of the same treatise he shows
that manifestations of divine and miraculous
power continued to his time in some of the
churches. He says:*

"But so far do they come short of rais
ing the dead, as the Lord raised them, and the
apostles through prayer. And oftentimes in the
brotherhood, when, on account of some neces
sity, our entire Church has besought with fasting
and much supplication, the spirit of the dead
has returned," and the man has been restored
through the prayers of the saints."

And again, after other remarks, he says:*

Heinichen, and Walesius (in his notes).

The original Greek is lost, though a great part of the first book can
be recovered by means of extensive quotations made from it by Hip
polytus and Epiphanius. The work is directed against the various
Gnostic systems, among which that of Valentinus is chiefly attacked.
The first book is devoted to a statement of their doctrines, the sec

the Lord raised them and as the apostles did by means of prayer,
and as has been frequently done in the brotherhood on account of
some necessity - the entire Church in that locality entreating with
much fasting and prayer [so that] the spirit of the dead man has
returned, and he has ton bestowed in answer to the prayer of the
saints - that they do not even believe this can possibly be done,
[and hold] that the resurrection from the dead is simply an acquaint
ance with that truth which they proclaim."

This resurrection of the dead recorded by Irenaeus is very diffi
cult to explain, as he is a truth-loving man, and we can hardly con
ceive of his uttering a direct falsehood.
Even Augustine, "the iron
man of truth," records such miracles, and so the early centuries
are full of accounts of them. The Protestant method of drawing
a line between the apostolic and post-apostolic ages in this matter
of miracles is arbitrary, and based upon dogmatic, not historical
grounds. The truth is, that no one can fix the point of time at
which miracles ceased; at the same time, it is easy to appreciate the
difference between the apostolic age and the third, fourth, and follow
ing centuries in this regard. That they did cease at an early date
in the history of the Church is clear enough.

CHAPTER VIII.

The Statements of Irenaeus in regard so the Di
wine Scriptures.

SINCE, in the beginning of this work,'
we promised to give, when needsul, the
words of the ancient presbyters and writers of
the Church, in which they have declared those
traditions which came down to them concerning
the canonical books, and since Irenaeus was one
of them, we will now give his words and, first,
what he says of the sacred Gospels: *

"Matthew published his Gospel among

7 Ado. Haer. W. 6. 1.

* Cf. Matt. x. 8.
* Eusebius is apparently thinking of the preface to his work con
tained in Bk. I. chap. 1, but there he makes no such promise as he
refers to here. He speaks only of his general purpose to mention
those men who preached the divine word either orally or in writing.
In Bk. III. chap. 3, however, he distinctly promises to do what he
here speaks of doing, and perhaps remembered only that he had
made such a promise without recalling where he had made it.

parture Mark, the disciple and interpreter
of Peter, also transmitted to us in writing those
things which Peter had preached;" and Luke,
the attendant of Paul, recorded in a book
the Gospel which Paul had declared." Afterwards John, the disciple of the Lord, who
also reclined on his bosom, published his Gospel,
while staying at Ephesus in Asia."

He states these things in the third book

of his above-mentioned work.
book he speaks as follows concerning the Apoc
alypse of John, and the number of the name of
Antichrist : *

"As these things are

so, and this num
ber is found in all the approved and ancient
copies," and those who saw John face to face
confirm it, and reason teaches us that the num
ber of the name of the beast, according to the
mode of calculation among the Greeks, appears
in its letters. . . .""

And farther on he says concerning the

same : *

"We are not bold enough to speak confidently
of the name of Antichrist.
For if it were neces
sary that his name should be declared clearly at
the present time, it would have been announced
by him who saw the revelation. For it was seen,
not long ago, but almost in our generation,
toward the end of the reign of Domitian."
He states these things concerning the
Apocalypse" in the work referred to. He
also mentions the first Epistle of John," taking

* See above, Bk. III. chap. 24, note 5.

Irenaeus, in this chapter
traces the four Gospels back to the apostles themselves, but he is
unable to say that Matthew translated his Gospel into Greek, which
is of course }. for his theory, as the Matthew Gospel which the
Church of his time had was in Greek, not in Hebrew. He puts the
Hebrew Gospel, however, upon a par with the three Greek ones,
and thus, although he does not say it directly, endeavors to convey
the impression that the apostolicity of the Hebrew Matthew is a
guarantee for the Greek Matthew also. Of Papias' statement,
". Each one translated the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew as he was
able," he could of course make no use even if he was acquainted
with it.
Whether his account was dependent upon Papias' or not

Already in Irenaeus' time there was a variation
in the copies of the Apocalypse.
This is interesting as showing the
existence of old copies of the Apocalypse even in his time, and also
as showing how early works became corrupted in the course of
transmission. We learn from his words, too, that textual criticism
had already begun.

" The sentence as Eusebius quotes it here is incomplete: he
repeats only so much of it as suits his purpose.
Irenaeus completes
his sentence, after a few more dependent clauses, by saying, "I
do not know how it is that some have erred, following the ordinary
mode of speech, and have vitiated the middle number in the name,"
&c.
This shows that even in Irenaeus' time there was as much
controversy about the interpretation of the Apocalypse as there has
always been, and that at that day exegetes were as a rule in no
better position than we are.
Irenaeus refers in this sentence to the
fact that the Greek numerals were indicated by the letters of the
alphabet: Alpha, "one," Beta, " two," &c.

* Adv. Harr. IV. 27. 1, where Irenaeus mentions a "certain
presbyter who had heard it from those who had seen the apostles,"
&c. Who this presbyter was cannot be determined.
Polycarp, Pa
pias, and others have been suggested, but we have no grounds upon
which to base a decision, though we may perhaps safely conclude
that so prominent a man as Polycarp would hardly have been re
ferred to in such an indefinite way; and Papias seems ruled out by
the fact that the presbyter is here not made a hearer of the apostles
themselves, while in V. 33.4 Papias is expressly stated to have been
a hearer of John, - undoubtedly in Irenaeus' mind the evangelist
John (see above, Bk. III. chap. 39, note 4).
Other anonymous
authorities under the titles, "One superior to us," "One before us,"
&c., are quoted by Irenaeus in Praef. § 2, I. 13. 3, III. 17. 4, etc.

* by name and quotes from some unknown work (but see above,

* Irenaeus nowhere mentions Ignatius by name, but in V. 28.4
he quotes from his epistle to the Romans, chap. 4, under the formula,
"A certain one of our people said, when he was condemned to the
wild beasts." It is interesting to note how diligently Eusebius had
read the works of Irenaeus, and extracted from them all that could
contribute to his History.

in this referring to his special work promised here, or only to his
general work Adv. Haer., we cannot tell.

simply a "young woman," not distinctively a "virgin." . The

and the various commentaries on Matthew).
Theodotion and
Aquila translated the Hebrew word by veaves, which is the correct
rendering, in spite of what Irenaeus says. The complete depend
ence of the Fathers upon the LXX, and their consequent errors as
to the meaning of the original, are well illustrated in this case (cf.
also Justin's Dial. chap. 71).

* This is the earliest direct reference to the translations of
Aquila and Theodotion, though Hermas used the version of the
latter, as pointed out by Hort (see above, Bk. III. chap.3, note 23).
Upon the two versions, see Bk. VI. chap. 16, notes 3 and 5.

The following story in regard to the origin of the LXX is first
told in a spurious letter (probably dating from the first century B.C.),
which professes to have been written by Aristeas, a high officer at
the court of Ptolemy Philadelphus (285|283]-247 p.c.). This epistle
puts the origin of the io in the reign of the latter monarch
instead of in that of his father, Ptolemy Soter, and is followed in this
by Philo, Josephus, Tertullian, and most of the other, ancient writ:
ers (Justin Martyr calls the king simply Ptolemy, while Clement of
Alex. says that some connect the event with the one monarch,
others with the other). The account given in the letter (which
is printed by Gallandius, Biłł. Patr. Ii. 771, as well as in many
other editions) is repeated over and over again, with greater or
less variations, by early Jewish and Christian writers (e.g. by Philo,
I it. Mos. 2; by Josephus, Ant. XII. 2; by Justin Martyr, Afo/.
I. 31; by Clement of Alexandria, Strom. I, 22; by Tertullian, Apol.

two, -six from each tribe. That this marvelous tale is a fiction is
clear enough, but whether it is based upon a groundwork of fact is
disputed (see Schürer, Gesch. der on den in Zetaster jesu
Christi, II. p. 697 sqq.).
It is at any rate certain that the Penta
teuch (the original account applies only to the Pentateuch, but
later it was extended to the entire Old Testament) was translated into
Greek in Alexandria as early as the third century E.c.; whether
under Ptolemy Philadelphus, and at his desire, we cannot tell. The
translation of the remainder of the Old Testament followed during
the second century B.C., the books being translated at various times
by unknown authors, but all or most of them probably in Egypt
(see Schürer, ibid.).
It was, of course, to the interest of the Chris
tians to maintain the miraculous origin of the LXX, for otherwise
they would have to yield to the attacks of the Jews, who often taunted
them with having only a translation of the Scriptures.
Accept
ing the miraculous origin of the LXX, the Christians, on the other
hand, could accuse the Jews of falsifying, their Hebrew, copies
wherever they differed from the LXX, making the latter the only
authoritative standard (cf. Justin Martyr's Dia!... chap. 71, and
many other passages in the work). Upon the attitude of the Chris
tians, and the earlier and later attitude of the Jews toward the LXX,

ually, as he feared
lest, by taking counsel
together, they might conceal the truth of the
Scriptures by their interpretation, he separated
them from one another, and commanded all of
them to write the same translation." He
did this for all the books.

came together in the presence of Ptolemy,

CHAPTER X.

Pantaenus the Philosopher.

ABOUT that time, Pantaenus,' a man highly
distinguished for his learning, had charge
of the school of the faithful in Alexandria." A
school of sacred learning, which continues to
our day, was established there in ancient times,"
* Pantaenus is the first teacher of the Alexandrian school that is
known to us, and even his life is involved in obscurity.
His chief
significance for us lies in the fact that he was the teacher of Clement,
with whom the Alexandrian school first steps out into the full light
of history, and makes itself felt as a power in Christendom. Another
prominent pupil of Pantaenus was Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem
(see below, Bk. VI. chap. 14).
Pantaenus was originally a Stoic
philosopher, and must have discussed philosophy in his school in
connection with theology, for Origen appeals to him as his example
in this respect (see below, Bk. § chap. 19).
His abilities are
testified to by Clement (in his Hypotyposes : see the next chapter,
§ 4), who speaks of him always in terms of the deepest respect and
affection.
Of his birth and death we know nothing. Clement,
Strom. I. 1, calls him a "Sicilian bee," which may, perhaps, have
reference to his birthplace.
The statement of Philip of Side,
that he was an Athenian, is worthless. We do not know when
he began his work in Alexandria, nor when he finished it.
But
from Bk. VI. chap. 6 we learn that Clement had succeeded Pan
taenus, and was in charge of the school in the time of Septimius
Severus.
This probably means not merely that Pantaenus had
left Egypt, but that he was already dead; and is that be the case,
the statement of Jerome (de vir, ill. 36), that Pantaenus was in
charge of the school during the reigns of Septimius Severus and
Caracalla, is erroneous (Jerome himself expressly says, in lood.
chap. 38, that Clement succeeded Pantaenus upon the death of the
latter).
Jerome's statement, however, that Pantaenus was sent to
India by Demetrius, bishop of Alexandria, is not necessarily in
conflict with the indefinite account of Eusebius, who gives no dates.
What authority Jerome has for his account we do not know.
If his
statement be correct, the journey must have taken place after 190;
and thus after, or in the midst of, his Alexandrian activity. Euse
bius apparently accepted the latter opinion, though his statement
at the end of this chapter is dark, and evidently implies that he was
very uncertain in regard to the matter. His whole account rests simply
on hearsay, and therefore too much weight must not be laid upon
its accuracy.
After Clement comes upon the scene (which was at
200 A.D.-when he left the city) we hear o: more of Pantaenus.
least some years before the outbreak of the persecution of Severus,
Some have put his journey to India in this later period; but this is
contrary to the report of Eusebius, and there is no authority for the
opinion.
Photius (Cod. 118) records a tradition that Pantaenus had
himself heard some of the apostles; but this is impossible, and is
According to Jerome, numerous commen

taries of Pantaenus were extant in . time.
Eusebius, at the close
of this chapter, speaks of his expounding the Scriptures "both orally
and in writing," but he does not enumerate his works, and apparently
had never seen them. No traces of them are now extant, unless
some brief reminiscences of his teaching, which we have, are sup
posed to be drawn from his works, and not merely from his lectures
or conversations (see Routh, Rel. Sac. I. p. 375-383).
* The origin of this school of the fift, or "catechetical
school," in Alexandria is involved in obscurity.
Philip of Side
names Athenagoras as the founder of the school, but his account is
full of inconsistencies and contradictions, and deserves no credence.
The school first comes out into the light of history at this time with
Pantaenus at its head, and plays a prominent part in Church history
under Clement, Origen, Heraclas, Dionysius, Didymus, &c., until
the end of the fourth century, when it sinks out of sight in the midst
of the dissensions of the Alexandrian church, and its end like its
beginning is involved in obscurity.
It probably owed its origin to
no particular individual, but arose naturally as an outgrowth from
the practice which flourished in the early Church of instructing
catechumens in the elements of Christianity before admitting them

school, though intended only for catechumens, would very naturally
soon assume a learned character, and it had already in the time of
Pantaenus at least become a regular theological school for the prepa
ration especially of teachers and preachers.
It exercised a great
influence upon theological science, and numbered among its pupils
many celebrated theologians and bishops.
See the article by Rode
penning in Herzog, 2d ed. I. 290-292, and Schaff's Ch. Hist. II.
777-781, where the literature of the subject is given.

* Jerome (de for. fl. c. 36) states that there had always been
ecclesiastical teachers in Alexandria from the time of Mark. He is
evidently, however, giving no independent tradition, but merely
draws his conclusion from the words of Eusebius, who simply says
"from ancient times." The date of the origin of the school is in
fact entirely unknown, though there is nothing improbable in the
statement of Jerome that ecclesiastical teachers were always there.
It must, however, have been some years before a school could be
developed or the need of it be kelt,

" Jerome (de vir. ill, 36) says that he was sent to India by the
bishop Demetrius at the request of the Indians themselves, - a
statement more exact than that of Eusebius, whether resting upon
tradition merely, or upon more accurate information, or whether it
is simply a combination of Jerome's, we do not know.
It is at any
rate not at all improbable (see above, note 1). A little farther on
Eusebius indicates that Pantaenus preached in the same country in

He follows Gutschmid therefore in claiming that the Indians here
are confounded with the Sindians, over whom the Bosphorian kings
of the house of Polemo ruled. lo (A.A. ad Magnum, Migne,
A.A. 70) evidently regards the India where Pantaenus preached as
India proper (Pantaenus Stoicar sectae philosoph us, o& Aracoue

Pantaenus went to India, and his connection with Bartholomew
(who was wrongly supposed to have preached to the Indians) was
a later combination, or whether, on the other hand, the tradition
that he preached in Bartholomew's field of labor was the original
and the mission to India a later combination, we cannot tell.
It is
probable that Eusebius meant India proper, as Jerome certainly
did, but both of them may have been mistaken.

In earlier times
they were called "apostles" (e.g. in the 19tatache), but the latter

to the existence of a Hebrew Matthew. See above, Bk. III. chap.

It has been assumed by some that this Gospel was the

This is possible; but even if Pantaenus really did find a Hebrew Gos

no grounds upon which to base a conclusion as to its nature, or its

Clement of Alexandria.

At this time Clement,' being trained with
him "in the divine Scriptures at Alexandria,
became well known. He had the same name
as the one who anciently was at the head of the
Roman church, and who was a disciple of
the apostles."
In his Hypotyposes" he
speaks of Pantaenus by name as his teacher.
It seems to me that he alludes to the same per
son also in the first book of his Stromata, when,
referring to the more conspicuous of the suc
cessors of the apostles whom he had met," he
says:"

about the middle of the second century. He received a very exten
sive education, and became a Christian in adult years, after he had
tried various systems of philosophy, much as }: Martyr had.
He had a great thirst for knowledge, and names six different teachers
under whom he studied Christianity (see below, io Finally he
became a pupil of Pantaenus in Alexandria, whom he afterward suc
ceeded as the head of the catechetical school there.
It is at this
time (about 190 A.D.) that he comes out clearly into the light of
history, and to this period (190-202) belongs his greatest literary
activity. He was at the head of the school probably until 202, when
the persecution of Severus having broken out, he left Alexandria, and
we have no notice that he ever returned. That he did not leave
Alexandria dishonorably, through fear, may be gathered from his
presence with Alexander during his imprisonment, and from the
letters of the latter (see below, Bk. VI. chaps. 11 and 14, and cf.
Bk. VI. chap. 6, notes).
This is the last notice that we have of
him (A.D. 212); and of the place and time of his death we know
nothing, though he cannot have lived many years after this. He
was never a bishop, but was a presbyter of He Alexandrian church,
and was in ancient times commemorated as a saint, but his name
was dropped from the roll by Clement VIII. on account of sus
pected heterodoxy. . He lived in an age of transition, and his great
importance lies in the fact that he completed the bond between Hel
lenism and Christianity, and as a follower of the apologists estab
lished Christianity as a philosophy, and yet not as they had done in
an apologetic sense. #. was the teacher of Origen, and the real
father of Greek theology. He published no system, as did Origen:
his works were rather desultory and fragmentary, but full of wide
and varied learning, and exhibit a truly broad and catholic spirit.

Various conjectures have been made as to who these teachers were,
but none are more than mere guesses.
Philip of Side tells us that
Athenagoras was a teacher of Clement, but, as we have seen, no
confidence can be placed in his statement. . It has been conjectured
also that Melito may be the person referred to as "the Ionian," for
Clement mentions his works, and wrote a book on the paschal ques
tion in reply to Melito's work on the same subject (see above, Bk.
IV. chap. 26, note 23).

This too, however, is mere conjecture.

* The lower part of the peninsula of Italy was called Magna

Graecia, because it contained so many Greek colonies.

10 Coele-Syria, was the valley lying between the eastern and

western ranges of Lebanon.

1. This has been conjectured to be Tatian.

But in the first place,
Clement, in Strom. III. 12, calls Tatian a Syrian instead of an
Assyrian (the terms are indeed often used interchangeably, but we
should nevertheless hardly expect Clement to call his own teacher
in one place a Syrian, in another an Assyrian). And again, in II.
12, he speaks very harshly of Tatian, and could hardly have referred
to him in this place in such terms of respect and affection.

** Various conjectures have been made as to the identity of this
teacher, - for instance, Theophilus of Caesarea (who, however, was
never called a Hebrew, according to Walesius), and Theodotus (so
Valesius).

13 Pantaenus. There can be no doubt as to his identity, for
Clement says that he remained with him and sought no further.
Eusebius omits a sentence here in which Clement calls Pantaenus
the ." Sicilian bee," from which it is generally concluded that he
was a native of Sicily (see the previous chapter, note 1).

* This entire passage is yery important, as showing not only
the extensiveness of Clement's own acquaintance with Christians,
but also the close intercourse of Christians in general, both East
and West.
Clement's statement in regard to the directness with
which he received apostolic tradition is not definite, and he by no
means asserts that his teachers were hearers of the apostles (which
in itself would not be impossible, but Clement would certainly have
spoken more clearly had it been a fact), nor indeed that they were
hearers of disciples of the apostles.
But among so many teachers,
so widely scattered, he could hardly have sailed to meet with some
who had at least known those who had known the apostles.
In any
case he considers his teachers very near the apostles as regards the
accuracy of their traditions.

The passage is also interesting, as showing the uniformity of
doctrine in different parts of Christendom, according to Clement's
view, though this does not prove much, as Clement himself was so
liberal and so much of an eclectic.
It is also interesting, as show
ing how much weight, Clement laid upon tradition, how completely
he rested upon it for the truth, although at the same time he was so
free and broad in his speculation.

1 The date of Narcissus' accession to the see of Jerusalem is not
known to us. The Chron. affords us no assistance; for although it
connects him among other bishops with the first (Armen.) or third
(Jerome) year of Severus, it does not pretend to give the date of
accession, and in one place says expressly that the dates of the Jeru
salem bishops are not known (non Aotufous discernere tempora
sing resort, ").
But from chap. 22 we learn that he was already
bishop in the tenth year of Commodus (189 A.D.); from chap. 23, that
he was one of those that presided at a Palestinian council, "... in the
time of Bishop Victor, of Rome, to discuss the paschal question (see

chap. 23, § 2); from Bk. VI. chap. 8, that he was alive at the time
of the persecution of Severus (202 sq.); and from the fragment of
one of Alexander's epistles given in Bk. VI. chap. 11, that he was
still alive in his 116th year, sometime after 212 A.D. (see Bk. VI.
chap. 11, note 1).
Epiphanius (Haer. LXVI. 20) reports that he
lived until the reign of Alexander Severus (222 A.D.), and this in itself
would not be impossible; for the epistle of Alexander referred to
might have been written as late as 222. But Epiphanius is a writer
of no authority; and the fact is, that in connection with Origen's
visit in Palestine, in 216 (see Bk. VI. chap. 19), Alexander is men
tioned as bishop of Jerusalem; and Narcissus is not referred to. We
must, therefore, conclude that Narcissus was dead before 216. We
learn from Bk. VI. chap. 9 that Narcissus had the reputation of
being a great miracle-worker, and he was a man of such great piety
and sanctity as to excite the hatred of a number of evil-doers, who
io. against him to blacken his character.
In consequence of
this he left Jerusalem, and disappeared entirely from the haunts of
men, so that it became necessary to appoint another bishop in his
place.
Afterward, his slanderers having suffered the curses im
precated upon themselves in their oaths against him, Narcissus re
turned, and was again made bishop, and was given an assistant,
Alexander (see Bk. VI. chaps. Io and 11). A late tradition makes
Narcissus a martyr (see Nicephorus, H. E. IV. 19), but there is no
authority for the report.

* Upon the so-called bishops of Jerusalem down to the destruc
tion of the city under Hadrian, see Bk. IV, chap. 5. Upon the
destruction of Jerusalem under Hadrian, and the founding of the
Gentile Church in AElia Capitolina, and upon Marcus the first Gentile
bishop, see Bk. IV. chap. 6.

The list given here by Eusebius purports to contain fifteen names,
Marcus being the sixteenth, and Narcissus being the thirtieth; but
only thirteen names are given.
In the Chron., however, and in
Epiphanius (Harr. LXVI. 20) the list is complete, a second Maxi
mus and a Valentinus being inserted, as 26th and 27th, between
Capito and Valens. The omission here is undoubtedly due simply
to the mistake of some scribe.
The Chron, puts the accession of
Cassianus into the 23d year of Antoninus Pius (160 A.D.), and the
accession of the second Maximus into the sixth year of Commodus
(185 A.D.), but it is said in the Chron. itself that the dates of the
various bishops are not known, and hence no reliance can be placed
Epiphanius puts the accession of the first Gaius

into the tenth year of Antoninus É. which is thirteen years earlier
than the date of the Chron. for the fourth bishop preceding. He
also puts the death of the second Gaius in the eighth year of Marcus
Aurelius (168 A.D.), and the death of the second Maximus in the
sixteenth year of the same reign, thus showing a variation from the
Chron. of more than nine years. The episcopate of Dolichianus is
brought down by him to the reign of Commodus (180 A.D.). As
shown in note 1, however, the date given by him for Narcissus is
i. wrong, and there is no reason for bestowing any greater cre
dence upon his other dates.
Syncellus assigns five years to Cassia
nus, five to Publius, four to Maximus, two to Julian, three to the
first Gaius, two to Symmachus, three to the second Gaius, four to
the second Julian, two to an Elias who is not named by our other
authorities, four to Capito, four to the second Maximus, five to
Antoninus, three to Valens, four to Narcissus the first time, and ten
the second time.
His list, however, is considerably confused, -
Dolichianus being thrown after Narcissus with an episcopate of
twelve years, - and at any rate no reliance can be placed upon the
figures given. We must conclude that we have no means of ascer
taining the dates of these various bishops until we reach Narcissus.
We know nothing about any of them (Narcissus excepted) beyond
the fact that they were bishops.

authorities call him Maximus.

All the authorities agree upon the name of the next Gaius

RHODO'S ACCOUNT OF APELLES.

CHAPTER XIII.

A'hodo and his Account of the Dissension of
Al/arcion.

l

At this time Rhodo," a native of Asia, who
had been instructed, as he himself states, by
Tatian, with whom we have already become ac
quainted, having written several books, pub
lished among the rest one against the heresy of
Marcion." He says that this heresy was divided
in his time into various opinions; * and while

"Therefore also

* We know nothing of Rhodo except what is contained in this
chapter. Jerome gives a very brief account of him in his de zor. Fol.
37, but it rests solely upon this chapter, with the single addition of
the statement that Rhodo wrote a work Against the Phrygians.
It is plain enough, however, that he had É. his account no inde
o source, and that he in this statement simply attributed to
hodo the work quoted by Eusebius as an anonymous work in
chap. 16. Jerome permits himself such unwarranted combinations
very frequently, and we need not be at all surprised at it. With
him a guess is often as good as knowledge, and in this case he
doubtless considered his guess a very shrewd one. There is no
warrant for supposing that he himself saw the work mentioned by
Eusebius, and thus learned its authorship. What Eusebius did not
learn from it he certainly could not, and his whole account betrays
the most slavish and complete dependence upon Eusebius as his
only source. In chap. 39 Jerome mentions Rhodo again as referring,
in a book which he wrote against Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla,
to Miltiades, who also wrote against the same heretics. This report
is plainly enough taken directly from Eusebius, chap. 17, where
Eusebius quotes from the same anonymous work. Jerome's utterly
baseless, combination is very interesting, and significant of his gen
eral method.

Rhodo's works are no longer extant, and the only fragments we

have are those preserved by Eusebius in this chapter.

* See Bk. IV. chap. 29.
* Upon Marcion and Marcionism, see Bk. IV. chap. 11, note 22.
* It is noticeable that Rhodo says y woulas, opinions, "...f.
Although the different Marcionites held various theoretical beliefs,
which gave rise to different schools, yet they did not split up into
sects, but remained one church, and retained the one general name
of Marcionites, and it is by this general name alone that they are
always referred to by the Fathers. The fact that they could hold
such variant beliefs £o one, two, or three principles; see below,
note 9) without splitting up into sects, shows that doctrines were
but a side issue with them, and that the religious spirit was the matter
upon which they laid the chief emphasis. This shows the funda
mental difference between Marcion and the Gnostics.

* These fragments of Rhodo are collected and discussed by

Routh in his A'es. Sacrae, I. 437-446.

" The Fathers entirely misunderstood Marcion, and mistook the
significance of his movement. They regarded it, like Gnosticism in
general, solely as a speculative system, and entirely overlooked its
practical airn. The speculative and theological was not the chief
thing with Marcion, but it is the only thing which receives any at
tention from his opponents.
His positions, all of which were held
only with a practical interest, were not treated by him in a specula
tive manner, nor were they handled logically and systematically.
As a consequence, many contradictions occur in them. These con
tradictions were felt by his followers, who laid more and more em
phasis upon the speculative over against the practical; and hence,
as Rhodo reports, they sell into disagreement, and, in their effort to
remove the inconsistencies, formed various schools, differing among
themselves according to the element upon which the greatest weight
was laid. There is thus some justification for the conduct of the
Fathers, who naturally carried back and attributed to Marcion the
principles of his followers.
But it is our duty to distinguish the man
from his followers, and to recognize his greatness in spite of their
littleness. Not all of them, however, fell completely away from his
practical religious spirit.
A pelles, as we shall see below, was in
many respects a worthy follower of his master.

Apelles was the greatest and most famous of Marcion's dis
ciples.
Tertullian wrote a special work against him, which is
unfortunately lost, but from his own quota:ions, and from those
of Pseudo-Tertullian and Hippolytus, it can be in part restored
(cf. Harnack's De Apellis Griosis Monarchia, p. 11 sqq.). As he

he must have been born early in the second century. We know
nothing definite either as to his birth or death. The picture which
we have of him in this chapter is a very pleasing one. He was a
man evidently of deep religious spirit and moral #, who laid weight
upon "trust in the crucified Christ" (see § 5, below), and upon
holiness in life in distinction from doctrinal beliefs; a man who
was thuso Marcionitic in his principles, although he dis.
sered so widely with Marcion in some of his doctrinal positions that
he was said to have founded a new sect (so Origen, //om. in Gen.
II. 2). The slightest difference, however, between his teaching and
Marcion's .# have been sufficient to make him the sounder of a
separate Gnostic sect in the eyes of the Fathers, and therefore this
statement must be taken with allowance (see note 4, above). The
account which Hippolytus (Phil. X. 16) gives of the doctrinal posi
tions of Apelles is somewhat different from that of Rhodo, but am
biguous and less exact. The scandal in regard to him, reported b
Tertullian, in his De Praescriptione, 30, is quite in accord with
Tertullian's usual conduct towards heretics, and may be set aside as
not having the slightest foundation in fact, and as absolutely con
tradicting what we know of Apelles from this report of his contem
. hodo. His moral character was certainly above reproach,
see *F. Harnack's De Apellis Gnosis Monarchia, Lips. 1874.
and the same may be said of his master, Marcion. Upon Apelles,
* The participle (a euvvvöuevos) carries with it the implication
that Apelles' character was affected or assumed. The implication,
however, does not lessen the value of Rhodo's testimony to his
character. He could not deny its purity, though he insinuated that
it was not sincere.

* This means that Apelles accepted only one God, and made the
creator but an angel who was completely under the power of the
Supreme God. Marcion, on the contrary, held, as said below, two
principles, teaching that the world-creator was himself a God,
eternal, uncreated, and independent of the good God of the Chris
tians.
It is true that Marcion represented the world-creator as
limited in power and knowledge, and taught that the Christian God
would finally be supreme, and the world-creator become subject to
him; but this, while it involves Marcion in self-contradiction as soon
as the matter is looked at theoretically, yet does not relieve him
from the charge of actual dualism. #. followers were more con
sistent, and either accepted one principle, subordinating the world
creator completely to the good God, as did Apelles, or else carried
out Marcion's dualism to its logical result and asserted the continued
independence of the Old Testament God and the world-creator, who
was thus very early identified with Satan and made the enemy of
the Christian God.
but the righteous in distinction from the good God.) , Still others
held three principles: the good God of the Christians, the righteous
God or world-creator, and the bad God, Satan. The varying doc
trines of these schools explain the discrepant and often contradictor
reports of the Fathers in regard to the doctrines of Marcion. Apel.
les' doctrine was a decided advance upon that of Marcion, as he
rejected the dualism of the latter, which was the destructive element

from the contradictions of the book endeavored to show his vacil

e, however, accepted the Old

reports which we have of him (e.g. in ...'. Tertullian,

as a prophetess who received revelations from an angel, and who
worked miracles.

many plays upon his profession (e.g. ibid. V. 1), and there is no
reason to take the word in a figurative sense (as has been done) and
suppose that he is called a mariner simply because of his nation
ality. We know that he traveled extensively, and that he was a
rich man (for he gave 200,000 sesterces at one time to the church of
Rome, which was a large sum for those days; see Tertullian, de
Praescript. 30). There is, therefore, no reason to doubt that he was
a "ship-master," as Tertullian calls him.

15. It was the custom of the Fathers to call the heretics hard
names, and Marcion received his full share of them from his oppo
ments, especially from Tertullian. He is compared to a wolf by
Justin also, Afol. I. 58, on account of his "carrying away" so
many "lambs" from the truth.

* This is a truly Christian sentiment, and Apelles should be
honored for the expression of it.
. It reveals clearly the religious
character of Marcionism in distinction from the speculative and the
ological character of the Gnostics, and indeed of many of the Fathers.
With Marcion and Apelles we are in a world of sensitive moral prin
ciple and of deep religious feeling like that in which Paul and Augus
time lived, but few others in the early Church.
Rhodo, in spite of
his orthodoxy, shows himself the . Gnostic over against . sin
cere believer, though the latter was in the eyes of the Church a
"blasphemous heretic."
Apelles' noble words do honor to the
movement - however heretical it was - which in that barren age of
theology could give them birth.

The latter clause, taken as it stands, would seem to indicate an
elevation of good works to the level of faith; but though it is pos

have said before, his opinion concerning God
was the most obscure of all.
For he spoke of
one principle, as also our doctrine does."

Then, after stating fully his own opinion,

he adds :

"When I said to him, Tell me how you know
this or how can you assert that there is one prin
ciple, he replied that the prophecies refuted them
selves, because they have said nothing true;"
for they are inconsistent, and false, and self-con
tradictory.

when he said that he did not know how there is
one unbegotten God, but that he believed it.
Thereupon I laughed and reproved him because,
though calling himself a teacher, he knew not how
to confirm what he taught.""

In the same work, addressing Callistio," the
same writer acknowledges that he had been
instructed at Rome by Tatian." And he says
that a book of Problems" had been prepared by
Tatian, in which he promised to explain the ob

sible that Apelles may have intended to express himself thus, it is
niore poli, when we remember the emphasis which Marcion laid
upon Paul's doctrine of salvation by the grace of God alone, that he
meant to do no more than emphasize good works as a natural result
of true faith, as we do to-day. The apparent co-ordination of the
two may o: lie simply in Rhodo's reproduction of Apelles'

Christian liberty, nor did any of his orthodox contemporaries. The
difference between the common conception of Christ's relation to the
law, and the conception of Paul as grasped by Marcion and perhaps
by Apelles, is well illustrated by a passage in Tertullian, in which
he expresses astonishment that the K., do not sin freely, so
long as they do not expect to be punished, and exclaims (to his own
dishonor), "I would sin without scruple, if I believed as you do."

* Rhodo had probably brought forward against Apelles proof

prophecies in general.
dualism, and accepted the "one principle," he soil rejected the Old
Testament.
This is quite peculiar, and yet perfectly comprehen
sible; for while Marcion was indeed the only one of that age that
understood Paul, yet as Harnack well says, even he misunderstood
him; and neither himself nor his followers were able to rise to Paul's
noble conception of the Old Testament law as a "schoolmaster to
bring us to Christ," and thus a part of the good God's general plan
of salvation.
It took, perhaps, a born Jew, as Paul was, to reach
that high conception of the law in those days. To Marcion and his
followers the law seemed to stand in irreconcilable conflict with the
Gospel, -Jewish law on the one side, Gospel liberty on the other, -
they could not reconcile them; they must, therefore, reject the
former as from another being, and not from the God of the Gospel.
There was in that age no historical interpretation of the Old Testa
ment.
It must either be interpreted allegorically, and made a com
pletely Christian book, or else it must i. rejected as opposed to
Christianity. Marcion and his followers, in their conception of law
and Gospel as necessarily opposed, could follow only the latter

simply upon dogmatic presumptions.
Apelles, although his rejec
tion of it undoubtedly originated in the same presumptions, yet sub
jected it to a criticism which satisfied him of the correctness of his
position, and gave him a fair basis of attack.
His procedure was,
therefore, more truly historical than that of Marcion, and antici
pated modern methods of higher criticism.

** A true Gnostic sentiment, over against which the pious
"agnosticism" of Apelles is not altogether unrefreshing.
The
Church did not fully conquer Gnosticism, - Gnosticism in some
degree conquered the Church, and the anti-Gnostics, like Apelles,
were called heretics. . It was the vicious error of Gnosticism that it
looked upon Christianity as knowledge, that it completely identified
the two, and our existing systems of theology, some of them, testify
to the fact that there are o Gnostics among us.

* Of this Callistio we know nothing; but, as has been remarked
by another, he must have been a well-known man, or Eusebius
would probably have said "a certain Callistio" (see Salmon's
article in Smith and Wace).

* Hippolytus (X. 16) also mentions works of Apelles against the
law and the prophets. We know of but one o his, viz. the
Syllogisms, which was devoted to the criticism of the Old Testa
ment, and in which he worked out the antitheses of Marcion in a
syllogistic form. The work is cited only by Origen (in Gen. II. 2)
and by Ambrose (De Parad. V. 28), and they have preserved but
a few brief fragments.
It must have been an extensive work, as
Ambrose quotes from the 38th book, . From these fragments we can
see that Apelles' criticism of the Old Testament was very keen and
sagacious.
For the difference between himself and Marcion in the
treatment of the Old Testament, see above, note 9. The words of
Eusebius, "as it seemed," show that he had not himself seen the
book, as might indeed be gathered from his general account of
Apelles, for which he depended solely upon secondary sources.

The Circumstances related of Montanus and his
False Prophets."

AGAINST the so-called Phrygian * heresy,
the power which always contends for the

* Montanism must not be looked upon as a heresy in the ordinary
sense of the term. The movement lay in the sphere of life and dis
cipline rather than in that of theology.
Its fundamental proposition
was the continuance of divine revelation which was begun under
the old Dispensation, was carried on in the time of Christ and his
apostles, and reached its highest development under the dispensation
of the Paraclete, which opened with the activity of Montanus. This
Montanus was a Phrygian, who, in the latter part of the second
century, began to fall into states of ecstasy and to have visions, and
believed himself a divinely inspired, prophet, through, whom the
promised Paraclete spoke, and with whom therefore the dispensation
of that Paraclete began. Two noble ladies (Priscilla and Maximilla)
attached themselves to Montanus, and had visions and prophesied
in the same way. These constituted the three original prophets of
the sect, and all that they taught was claimed to be of binding
authority on all. They were quite orthodox, accepted fully the
doctrinal teachings of the Catholic Church, and did not pretend to
alter in any way the revelation given by Christ and his apostles.
But they claimed that some things had not been revealed by them,
because at that early stage the à. was not able to bear them;
but that such additional revelations were now given, because the
fullness of time had come which was to precede the second coming
of Christ. These revelations had to do not at all with theology, but
wholly with matters of life and discipline.
They taught a rigid
asceticism over against the growing ois, of the Church, severe
discipline over against its i. methods, and finally the universal
priesthood of believers (even female), and their right to perform all
the functions of church officers, over against the growing sacer
dotalism of the Church.
They were thus in a sense resormers, or
perhaps reactionaries is a better term, who wished to bring back,
or to preserve against corruption, the original principles and methods
of the Church. They aimed at a puritanic reaction against world
liness, and of a democratic reaction against growing aristocracy in
the Church. They insisted that ministers were made by God alone,
by the direct endowment of his Spirit in distinction from human
ordination. They looked upon their prophets - supernaturally called
and endowed by the Spirit - as supreme in the Church. They
claimed that all gross offenders should be excommunicated, and that
neither they nor the lax should ever be re-admitted to the Church.
They encouraged celibacy, increased the number and severity of
fasts, eschewed worldly amusements, &c.
This rigid asceticism was
enjoined by the revelation of the Spirit through their prophets, and
was promoted by their belief in the speedy coming of Christ to set
up his kingdom on earth, which was likewise prophesied. They
were thus pre-Millenarians or Chiliasts.

The movement spread rapidly in Asia Minor and in North
Africa, and for a time in Rome itself.
It appealed very powerfully
to the sterner moralists, stricter disciplinarians, and more deeply
pious minds among the Christians.
All the puritanically inclined
schisms of this period attracted many of the better class of Chris
tians, and this one had the additional advantage of claiming the
authority of divine revelation for its strict principles. The greatest
convert was Tertullian, who, in 201 or zoz, attracted by the asceti
cism and disciplinary rigor of the sect, attached himself to it, and
remained until his death its most powerful advocate. He seems to
have stood at the head of a separatist congregation of Montanists in
Carthage, and yet never to have
en excommunicated by the
Catholic Church.
Montanism made so much stir in Asia Minor that
synods were called before the end of the second century to consider
the matter, and finally, though not without hesitation, the whole
in ovement was oft. condemned.
Later, the condemnation was
ratified in Rome and also in North Africa, and Montanism gradu
ally degenerated, and finally, aster two or three centuries, entil cly
disappeared.

ut although it failed and passed away, Montanism had a
marked influence on the development of the Church.
In the first
place, it aroused a general distrust of prophecy, and the result was
that the Church soon came to the conviction that prophecy had
entirely ceased.
In the second place, the Church was, led to see
the necessity of emphasizing the historical Christ and historical
Christianity over against the Montanistic claims of a constantly
developing revelation, and thus to put great emphasis upon the
Scripture canon.
In the third place, the Church had to lay in;
creased stress upon the organization - upon its appointed and
ordained officers - over against the claims of irregular prophets who
might at any time arise as organs of the Spirit. The development
of Christianity into a religion of the book and of the organization
was thus greatly advanced, and the line began to be sharply drawn
between the age of the apostles, in which there had been direct
supernatural revelations, and the later age, in which such revela.
tions had disappeared. We are, undoubtedly, to date from this time
that exalted conception of the glory of the apostolic age, and , of its
absolute separation from all subsequent ages, which marks so
strongly the Church of succeeding centuries, and which led men to

For further
articulars in regard to Montanism, see the notes on this and the
É. chapters.

Our chief sources for a knowledge of Montanism are to be found
in the writings of Tertullian.
See, also, Epiphanius, //aer. XLVIII.
and XLIX., and Jerome's Epistle to §. (Migne, AeA. 41).
The fragments from the anonymous anti-Montanistic writer quoted
by Eusebius in this and the following chapter, and the fragments of
Apollonius' work, quoted in chap. 18, are of the greatest importance.
It is to be regretted that Eusebius has preserved for us no frag
ments of the anti-Montanistic writings of Apolinarius and Melito,
who might have given us still earlier and more trustworthy accounts
of the sect.
It is probable that their works were not decided enough
in their opposition to Montanism to suit Eusebius, who, therefore,
chose to o. his account from somewhat later, but certainly bitter
enough antagonists.
The works of the Montanists themselves
(except those of Tertullian) have entirely perished, but a few
"Oracles," or prophetic utterances, of Montanus, Priscilla, and
Maximilla, have been preserved by Tertullian and other writers, and

biades in chap. 3 we should read, as Salmon suggests, Miltiades.
The occurrence of the name Alcibiades in the previous sentence
might explain its substitution for Miltiades immediately afterward.
It is at least easier to account for that change than for the change
of Alcibiades to Miltiades in the present chapter. Were Salmon's
suggestion accepted, the difficulty in this case would be obviated,
for we should then have a Montanist Miltiades of sufficient promi
nence to justify the naming of the sect after him in some quarters.
The suggestion, however, rests upon mere conjecture, and it is
safer to retain the reading of our MSS. in both cases.
Until we get
more light from some quarter we must be content to let the matter
rest, leaving the reason for the use of Miltiades' name in this connec

the beginning of his work, he proceeds to
state the cause of the above-mentioned heresy
as follows:

"Their opposition and their recent heresy
which has separated them from the Church
arose on the following account.
There is
said to be a certain village called Ardabau
in that part of Mysia, which borders upon Phry
gia."
There first, they say, when Gratus was
proconsul of Asia," a recent convert, Montanus
by name, through his unquenchable desire for
adversary opportunity
leadership," gave the
against him. And he became beside himself,
and being suddenly in a sort of frenzy and ec
stasy, he raved, and began to babble and utter
strange things, prophesying in a manner con
trary to the constant custom of the Church
handed down by tradition from the be
ginning." Some of those who heard his

Having said this with other things, in spurious utterances at that time were indig
nant, and they rebuked him as one that was
possessed, and that was under the control of
a demon, and was led by a deceitful spirit,
and was distracting the multitude; and they for
bade him to talk, remembering the distinction"
drawn by the Lord and his warning to guard
watchfully against the coming of false prophets."
But others imagining themselves possessed of
the Holy Spirit and of a prophetic gift," were
elated and not a little puffed up ; and forgetting
the distinction of the Lord, they challenged the
mad and insidious and seducing spirit, and were
cheated and deceived by him.
In consequence
of this, he could no longer be held in check,
so as to keep silence. Thus by artifice, or
rather by such a system of wicked craft,
the devil, devising destruction for the disobe
dient, and being unworthily honored by them,
secretly excited and inflamed their understand
ings which had already become estranged from
the true faith. And he stirred up besides two
women," and filled them with the false spirit, so
that they talked wildly and unreasonably and
strangely, like the person already mentioned."
And the spirit pronounced them blessed as they
rejoiced and gloried in him, and puffed them up
by the magnitude of his promises.
But some
times he rebuked them openly in a wise and

Hieropolis (see note 6), and that the anonymous companion Zoticus
was from Otrous, would lead us to look in that neighborhood for
the hyme of our author, though hardly to either of those towns (the
mention of the name of the town in connection with Zoticus' name
would seem to shut out the latter, and the opening sentences of the
treatise would seem to exclude the former).

It is not said here that Mon
tanus was born in Ardabau, but it is natural to conclude that he
was, and so that village is commonly given as his birthplace. As
we learn from this passage, Ardabau was not in Phrygia, as is often
said, but in Mysia. The boundary line between the two districts
was a very indefinite one, however, and the two were often con
founded by the ancients themselves; but we cannot doubt in the
present instance that the very exact statement of the anonymous
writer is correct. Of the village of Ardabau itself we know nothing.
1* The exact date of the rise of Montanism cannot be determined.
The reports which we have of the movement vary greatly in their
chronology. We have no means of fixing the date of the procon
sulship of the Gratus referred to here, and thus the most exact and
reliable statement which we have does not help us.
In his Chron.
Eusebius fixes the rise of the movement in the year 172, and it is
possible that this statement was based upon a knowledge of the time
of Gratus' proconsulship.
If so, it possesses considerable weight.
The first notice we have of a knowledge of the movement in the
West is in connection with the martyrs of Lyons, who in the year 177
(see Introd. to this book, note 3) were solicited to use their influence
with the bishop of Rome in favor of the Montanists (see above,
chap. 3, note 6).
This goes to confirm the approximate accuracy of
the date given by Eusebius, for we should expect that the move
me it cannot have attracted public notice in the East very many
years before it was heard of in Gaul, the home of many Christians
from Asia Minor.
Epiphanius (Haer. XLVIII.) gives the nine
teenth year of Antoninus Pius (156-157) as the date of its beginning,
but Epiphanius' figures are very confused, and contradictory, and
little reliance can be placed upon them in this connection.
At the
same time Montanus must have begun his prophesying some years
before his teaching spread over Asia Minor and began to agitate the

M2 itanism had a beginning some years before the date given by
Eusebius; in fact, it is not impossible that Montanus may have
begun his work before the end of the reign of Antoninus Pius.

** Ambition was almost universally looked upon by the Church
Fathers as the occasion of the various heresies and schisms. Nova
tian, Donatus, and many others were accused of it by their orthodox
opponents. That heretics or schismatics could be actuated by high
and noble motives was to them inconceivable. We are thus fur
nished another illustration of their utter misconception of the nature

heresy so often referred to in these notes.
* The fault found by the Church with Montanus' prophec

was rather because of its form than because of its substance.
It
was admitted that the prophecies contained much that was true,
but the soberer sense of the Church at large objected decidedly
to the frenzied ecstasy in which they were delivered.
That a
change had come over the Church in this respect since the apos
Paul's time the speaking with

tongues, which involved a similar kind of ecstasy, was very com
mon; so, too, at the time the Dia'a he was written the prophets
spoke in an ecstasy (êv movevuart, which can mean nothing else; cf.
Harnack's edition, p. 122 sq.).
But the early enthusiasm of the
Church had largely passed away by the middle of the second cen
tury; and though there were o prophets (Justin, for instance, and
even Clement of Alexandria knew of them), they were not in gen
eral characterized by the same ecstatic and frenzied utterance that

marked their predecessors. To say that there were mone such at
this time would be rash; but it is plain that they had become so de
cidedly the exception that the revival by the Montanists of the old
method on a large scale and in its extremest form could appear to
the Church at large only a decided innovation.
Prophecy in itself
was nothing strange to them, but prophecy in this form they were
not accustomed to, and did not realize that it was but a revival of
the ancient form (cf. the words of our author, who is evidently quite
ignorant of that form). That they should be shocked at it is not to
be wondered at, and that they should, in that age, when all such
manifestations were looked upon as supernatural in their origin, re
gard these prophets as under the influence of Satan, is no more sur
prising. There was no other alternative in their minds.
Either the
rophecies were from God or from Satan; not their content mainly,
i. the manner in which they were delivered aroused the suspicion
of the bishops and other leaders of the Church. Add to that the fact
that these prophets claimed supremacy over the constituted Church
authorities, claimed that the Church must be guided by the revela
tions vouchsased to women and apparently half-crazy enthusiasts and
samatics, and it will be seen at once that there was nothing left for the
leaders of the Church but to condemn the movement, and pronounce
its prophecy a fraud and a work of the Evil Qne. That all proph
ecy should, as a consequence, fall into discredit was natural. Clem
ent (Strom. I. 17) gives the speaking in an ecstasy as one of the
marks of a false prophet, - Montanism had evidently brought the
Church to distinct consciousness on that point, - while Origen,
some decades later, is no longer acquainted with prophets, and de
nies that they existed even in the time of Celsus (see Contra Cels.
VII. 11).

1s Maximilla and Priscilla, or, Prisca (mentioned in chap. 14).
They were married women, who left their husbands to become dis
ciples of Montanus, were given the rank of virgins in his church,
and with him were the greatest prophets of the scot. They were
regarded with the most profound reverence by all Montanists, who
in many quarters were called after the name of the latter, Priscillian,
ists.
It was a characteristic of the Montanists that they insisted
upon the religious equality of men and women; that they accorded
just as high honor to the women as to the men, and listened to their
prophecies with the same reverence. The human person was but
an instrument of the Spirit, according to their view, and hence
woman might be chosen by the Spirit as his instrument just as well
as a man, the ignorant just as well as the learned.
Tertullian, for
instance, cites, in support of his doctrine of the materiality of the
soul, a vision seen by one of the female members of his church, whom
he believed to be in the habit of receiving revelations from God
(de anima, 9).

men? None.
Or has any of them been seized

We do not know the places or the dates of any of these synods,
although the Läcl/us Synodoicus states that one was held at Hie

and another at Anchialus under Sotas, with twelve bishops present.
The authority for these synods is too late to be of much weight, and
the report is just such as we should expect to have arisen upon
the basis of the account of Montanism given in this chapter.

THe says again in the same book that the
holy bishops of that time attempted to re
fute the spirit in Maximilla, but were prevented
by others who plainly co-operated with the
spirit. He writes as follows:

"And let not the spirit, in the same work
of Asterius Urbanus," say through Maximilla,
‘I am driven away from the sheep like a wolf."
I am not a wolf.
I am word and spirit and
power.'
But let him show clearly and prove the
power in the spirit. And by the spirit let him
compel those to confess him who were then
present for the purpose of proving and reasoning
with the talkative spirit, - those eminent men

worthlessness needs no demonstration. Even our anonymous author
does not venture to call it certain.

* *mitronos: a steward, or administrator of funds. The exist
ence of such an officer shows that the Montanists formed a compact
organization at an early date, and that much stress was laid upon it
(cf. chap. 18. § 2). . According to Jerome (Ep. ad Marceliam;
Migne, #. XLI. 3) the Montanists at Pepuza had three classes of
officers: first, Patriarchs; second, Cenomar; third, Bishops (Habent
enim Arimos de Pepusa Phrygiae Patriarchas: secundos, gnos
opellant Cenonas: atque ita in tertium, id est, Aene ultimum
Jocume Episcopi dezocivil mtur). The peculiar word Cenomas occurs
nowhere else, so far as I am aware, but its meaning is plain enough.
Whether it is merely a reproduction of the Greek oixovopoi ("ad
ministrators"), or whether it is a Latin word connected with carna,
in either case the officers designated by it were economic officers,
and thus performed the same class of duties as this omit ponos,
Theodotus. The reliability of Jerome's report is confirmed by its
agreement in this point with the account of the Anonymous.
Of
Theodotus himself (to be distinguished, of course, from the two
Theodoti mentioned in chap. 28) we know only what is told us in
this chapter and in chap. 3, above.
It is plain that he was a promi
nent man among the early Montanists.

* The reference here seems to be to a death like that recorded
by a common tradition of Simon Magus, who by the help of demons
undertook to fly up to heaven, but when in mid air fell and was
killed. Whether the report in regard to Theodotus was in any wa
connected with the tradition of Simon's death we cannot tell, thoug
our author can hardly have thought of it, or he would certainly have
likened Theodotus' fate to that of the arch-heretic Simon, as he
likened the sate of Montanus and Maximilla to that of Judas. What
ever the exact form of death referred to, there is of course no more
confidence to be placed in this report than in the pieceding one.

27 Of this Asterius Urbanus we know only what we can gather
from this reference to him.
Walesius, Tillemont, and others sup
posed that the words ov to avro Aoyo to karū ‘Aateptov Qipborov
were a scholium written on the margin of his copy by Eusebius
himself or some ancient commentator to indicate the authorship of
the anonymous work from which the fragments in this chapter are
taken (and so in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. VII., these srag
ments are given as from the work of Asterius Urbanus).
But Euse
bius himself evidently did not know the author, and it is at any rate
much easier to suppose the words a part of the text, and the work
of Asterius a work which our anonymous author has been discussing
and from which he quotes the words of Maximilla, just below.
Accepting this most natural interpretation of the words, we learn
that Asterius Urbanus was a Montanist who had written a work in
defense of that sect.

man among the Montanists in the time of our anonymous author,
that is, after the death of Montanus himself; and it is quite likely
that he was, as Salmon suggests, the head of the sect.

* This gives us a clear indication of the date of the composition
of this anonymous work. The thirteen years must fall either before
the wars which began in the reign of Septimius Severus, or after
their completion. #. earliest possible date in the latter case is 232,
and this is certainly much too late for the composition of this work,
which speaks of Montanism more than once as a recent thing, and
which it seems clear from other indications belongs rather to the
earlier period of the movement.
If we put its composition before
those wars, we cannot place it later than 192, the close of the reign
of Commodus. This would push the date of Maximilla's death back
to 179, which, though it seems rather early, is not at all impossible.
The period from about 179 to 192 might very well be called a time
of peace by the Christians; for no serious wars occurred during that
interval, and we know that the Christians were lest comparatively
undisturbed throughout the reign of Commodus.

nied in § 12, above, that the Montanists had martyrs among their

force.

martyrs among them proved that they were heretics; here he claims
that the existence of such martyrs does not in any way argue for

deed, those called Marcionites, from the heresy
of Marcion, say that they have a multitude of
martyrs for Christ; yet they do not confess
Christ himself in truth."

A little farther on he continues:
"When those called to martyrdom from

the Church for the truth of the faith have met
with any of the so-called martyrs of the Phrygian
heresy, they have separated from them, and died
without any fellowship with them," because they
did not wish to give their assent to the spirit of
Montanus and the women. And that this is true
and took place in our own time in Apamea on
the Maeander," among those who suffered mar
tyrdom with Gaius and Alexander of Eumenia,
is well known."

reign of Marcus Aurelius, after Montanism had become somewhat
widespread, and when martyrdoms were a common thing both in the
East and West. Thraseas, bishop of Eumenia, is referred to as a
martyr by Polycrates in chap. 24, but he can hardly have suffered
with the ones referred to here, or his name would have been men
tioned instead of the more obscure names of Gaius and Alexander.

* This Miltiades is known to us from three sources: from the
present chapter, from the Roman work quoted by Eusebius in chap.
28, and from Tertullian (adz". I'al. chap. 5). Jo: also mentions
him in two places (de vir. ii. 39 and Ep. ad Magnum, Migne's
ed. Ep. 70, § 3), but it is evident that he derived his knowledge
solely from Eusebius.
That Miltiades was widely known at the
end of the second century is clear from the notices of him by an
Asiatic, a Roman, and a Carthaginian writer. The position in which
he is mentioned by Tertullian and by the anonymous Roman writer
would seem to indicate that he flourished during the reign of Marcus

from $ 5, below, by which might be meant, either Marcus Aurelius
and Lucius Verus (161-169), or Marcus, Aurelius, and Commodus
(177-183).
Jerome states that he flourished during the reign of
Commodus (Floruit autem. M. Antonini Commodi temperious,
Vallarsi adds a gue after Commodi, thus making him flourish in the
times of M. Antoninus and Commodus, but there is no authority
for such an addition).
It is quite possible that he was still alive in
the time of Commodus (though Jerome's statement is of no weight,
for it rests upon no independent authority), but he must at any ote
have written his Apology before the ... of Marcus Aurelius. The
only works of Ms. named by our authorities are the anti
Montanistic work referred to here, and the three mentioned by
Eusebius at the close of this chapter (two books. Against the
Greeks, two books Against the orivs, and an Apology). , Tertul.
lian speaks of him as an anti-Gnostic writer, so that it is clear that
he must have written another work not mentioned by Eusebius: a d

book against the above-mentioned heresy. After
quoting some of their words, he adds:

"Having found these things in a certain work
of theirs in opposition to the work of the brother
Alcibiades," in which he shows that a prophet
ought not to speak in
ecstasy," I made an
abridgment."

A little further on in the same work he
gives a list of those who prophesied under
the new covenant, among whom he enumer
ates a certain Ammia" and Quadratus," saying:

anonymous writer quoted in chap. 28, who ranks him with Justin,
Tatian, Irenaeus, Melito, and Clement as one who had asserted the
divinity of Christ.
Eusebius appears to have seen the three works
which he mentions at the close of this chapter, but he does not quote
from them, and no fragments of any of Miltiades' writings have been
preserved to us; he sceins indeed to have passed early out of the
memory of the Church.

A very perplexing question is his relation to Montanism. Ac
cording to Eusebius, he was the author of an anti-Montanistic work,
but this report is beset with serious difficulties. The extract which
Eusebius quotes just below as his authority has "Alcibiades," not
"Miltiades," according to the unanimous testimony of the MSS.
and versions.
It is very difficult to understand how Miltiades, if it
stood originally in the text, could have been changed to Alcibiades.
Nevertheless, most editors have thought it necessary to make the
change in the present case, and most historians (including even
Harnack) accept the alteration, and regard Miltiades as the author

of a lost anti-Montanistic work.
charge at first sight seems to be, I am unable to believe that we are
justified in making it.
I should be inclined to think rather that
Eusebius had in is read his authority, and that, finding Miltiades re
ferred to in the immediate context (perhaps the Montanist Mil
tiades mentioned in chap. 16), he had, in a hasty perusal of the
work, overlooked the less familiar name Alcibiades, and had con
founded Miltiades with the author of the anti-Montanistic work
referred to here by our Anonymous. He would then naturally iden
tify him at once with the Miltiades known to him through other
works.
If we suppose, as Salmon suggests, that Eusebius did not
copy his own extracts, but employed a scribe to do that work (as we
should expect so busy a man, to do), it may well be that he simply
marked this extract in regard to the anti-Montanistic work without
noticing his blunder, and that the scribe, copying the sentence just
as it stood, correctly wrote Alcibiades instead of Miltiades.
In con
firmation of the supposition that Eusebius was mistaken in making
Miltiades the author of an anti-Montanistic work may be urged the
fact that Tertullian speaks of Miltiades with respect, and ranks him
with the greatest Fathers of the second century.
It is true that the
term by which he describes him (ecclesia rum sophista) may not
(as Harnack maintains) imply as much praise as is given to Procu
lus in the same connection; nevertheless Tertullian does treat Mil
tiades with respect, and does accord him a high position among
coclesiastical writers.
But it is certainly difficult to suppose that
Tertullian can thus have honored a man who was known to have
written against Montanism.
Still further, it must be noticed that
Eusebius himself had not seen Miltiades' anti-Montanistic work; he
knew it only from the supposed mention of it in this anonymous
work srom which he was quoting.
Certainly it is not, on the whole,
difficult to suppose him mistaken and our MSS. and versions cor
rect.
I therefore prefer to retain the traditional reading Alcibiades,
and have so translated. Of the Alcibiades who wrote the anti
Montanistic treatise referred to, we know nothing.
Upon Mil
tiades, see especially Harmack's Torte rand Uzters tech rangen, I. 1,

* This was the first work, so far as we know, to denounce the
practice of prophesying in ecstasy. The practice, which had doubt
less sallen almost wholly into disuse, was brought into decided dis
repute on account of the excesses of the Montanists, and the position
taken by this Alcibiades became very soon the position of the whole
Church (see the previous chapter, note 14).

* Of this prophetess Ammia of Philadelphia, we know only what
we can gather from this chapter. She would seem to have lived
carly in the second century, possibly in the latter part of the first,
and to have been a prophetess of considerable prominence.
That
the Montanists had good ground for appealing to her, as well as to
the other prophets mentioned as their models, cannot be denied.
These early prophets were doubtless in their enthusiasm far more
like the Montanistic prophets than like those whom the Church of
the latter part of the second century alone wished to recognize.

away in spirit.
Neither can they boast of Aga

or any others not belonging to them."

And again after a little he says: "For if
after Quadratus and Ammia in Philadelphia,
as they assert, the women with Montanus received
the prophetic gift, let them show who among
them received it from Montanus and the women.

so; for we know that there were Montanistic prophetesses in Ter

there was still a prophetess at the time Apollonius wrote (see

APOLLONIUS ON MONTANISM.

CHAPTER XVIII.

The Manner in which Apollonius refused the
Phrygians, and the Persons' whom he men
tions.

As the so-called Phrygian heresy" was still
flourishing in Phrygia in his time, Apollo
nius" also, an ecclesiastical writer, undertook its
refutation, and wrote a special work against it,
correcting in detail the false prophecies current
among them and reproving the life of the founders

* On the name, see chap. 16, note 2.
* Of this Apollonius we know little more than what Eusebius
tells us in this chapter. The author of Praedestinatus (in the fifth
century) calls him bishop of Ephesus, but his authority is of no
weight. Jerome devotes chap. 4o of his de zor. o. to Koi...o.
but it is clear that he derives his knowledge almost exclusively from
Eusebius.
He adds the notice, however, that Tertullian replied
to Apollonius' work in the seventh book of his own work, de AEcstasi
(now lost). The character of Apollonius' work may be gathered
from the fragments preserved by Eusebius in this chapter.
It was
of the same nature as the work of the anonymous writer quoted in
chap. 16, very bitter in tone and not over-scrupulous, in its state
ments. Apollonius states (see in § 12, below) that he wrote the

Eusebian date for its beginning (172), this would bring us down to
212, but (as remarked above, in chap. 16, note 12) Montanism had
robably begun in a quiet way sometime before this, and so Apol
E. forty years are perhaps to be reckoned from a somewhat
is mention of "the prophetess" as still living (in
earlier date.
§ 6, below) might lead us to think that Maximilla was still alive
when he wrote; but when the anonymous wrote she was already
dead, and the reasons for assigning the latter to a date as carly as
192 are too strong to be set aside. We must therefore suppose
Apollonius to be referring to some other prophetess well known in
his time. That there were many such prophetesses in the early
art of the third century is clear from the works of Tertullian,

i. (18; d.) states that an account of the death of Montanus and

is prophetesses by hanging was contained in Apollonius' work, but
it has been justly suspected that he is confusing the work of the
anonymous, quoted in chap. 16, above, with the work of Apollonius,
quoted in this chapter. The fragments of Apollonius' work, pre
served by Eusebius, are given, with a commentary, in Routh's Rei.
Sac. I. p. 467 sq., and an English translation in the Ante-Vicene
Fathers, Wifi. p. 775 sq.

I. 9.

* We are not to gather from this that the Montanists forbade
marriage. They were, to be sure, decidedly ascetic in their tendencies,
and they did teach the unlawfulness of second marriages, - which
had long been looked upon with disfavor in many quarters, but
whose lawfulness the Church had never denied, - and magnified the
blessedness of the single state; but beyond this they did not go, so
far as we are able to judge. Our ''...} sources for the Montanistic
view of marriage are Tertullian's works ad U.rorco, de Pudicit.,
goo." de Erhart. ad castitat., and Epiphanius' AHarr.
* One great point of dispute between the Montanists and the
Catholics was the subject of fasts (cf. Hippolytus, VIII. 12, X. 21,
who makes it almost the only ground of complaint against the Mon
tanists). The Montanist prophetesses ordained two new fasts of a
week each in addition to the annual paschal fast of the Church; and
the regulations for these two weeks were made very severe.
Still
further they extended the duration of the regular weekly (Wednes
day and Friday) fasts, making them cover the whole instead of only
a part of the day. The §. very strenuously opposed these
ordinances, not because they were opposed to fasting (many of them
indulged extensiyely in the practice), but because they objectod to
the imposition of such extra fasts as binding upon the Church. They
were satisfied with the traditional customs in this matter, and did not
care to have heavier burdens imposed upon the Christians in general
than their fathers had borne. Our principal sources for a knowledge
of the dispute between the Montanists and Catholics on this subject
are: +..." de Jeyun iss, Epiphanius, Harr. XLVIII. 8; Jerome,
AeA. ad Marcellam (Migne, E/. XLI. 3), Comment. in Matt. c.
9, vers. 15; and Theodoret, Haer. Fab. iii. 2.

* Pepuza was an obscure town in the western part of Phrygia:
Tymion, otherwise unknown, was probably situated in the same

small towns in Phrygia, Jerusalem, wishing to
gather people to them from all directions; who
appointed collectors of money;' who contrived
the receiving of gifts under the name of offer
ings ; who provided salaries
those who
preached his doctrine, that its teaching might
prevail through gluttony.""

for

He writes thus concerning Montanus;
and a little farther on he writes as follows
concerning his prophetesses: "We show that
these first prophetesses themselves, as soon as
they were filled with the Spirit, abandoned their
husbands. How falsely therefore they speak who
call Prisca a virgin."

Afterwards he says: "Does not all Scrip
ture seem to you to forbid a prophet to re
ceive gifts and money?" When therefore I see
the prophetess receiving gold and silver and
costly garments, how can I avoid reproving
her?"

And again a little farther on he speaks

thus concerning one of their confessors:

"So also Themiso," who was clothed with
plausible covetousness, could not endure the
sign of confession, but threw aside bonds for
an abundance of possessions.
Yet, though he
should have been humble on this account, he
dared to boast as a martyr, and in imitation of
the apostle, he wrote a certain catholic" epistle,

*

neighborhood.
Pepuza was early made, and long continued, the
chief center - theo the sect, and even gave its name
to the sect in many quarters.
Harnack has rightly emphasized the
significance of this statement of Apollonius, and has called attention
to the fact that Montanus' original idea must have been the gathering
of the chosen people from all the world into one region, that they
might form one sold, and freed from all the political and social rela
tions in which they had hitherto lived might await the coming of
the Lord, who would speedily descend, and set up his kingdom in
this new Jerusalem. Only after this idea had been proved imprac
ticable did Montanism adapt itself to circumstances and proceed to
establish itself in the midst of society as it existed in thc outside
world. That Montanus built upon the Gospel of John, and espe
cially upon chaps. x. and xvii., in this original attempt of his, is per
sectly plain (cf. Harnack's, Pogunengeschächte, I. p. 319 and 323.
With o passage from Apollonius, compare also Epiphanius, //aer.
XLVIII. 14 and XI, IX. 1, and Jerome AEA. ad J/arcc//a in).

* This appointment of economic officers and the formation of a
compact organization were a part of the one general plan, referred to
in the previous note, and must have marked the earliest years of the
sect.
Later, when it was endeavoring to adapt itself to the catholic
Church, and to compromise matters in such a way as still to secure
recognition from the Church, this organization must have been looked
upon as a matter of less importance, and indeed probably never went
far beyond the confines of Phrygia. That it continued long in that
region, however, is clear from Jerome's words in his Epistle to
Marcella already referred to. Compare also chap 16, note 25.

* There can be little doubt that the Church teachers and other
officers were still supported by voluntary contributions, and hence
Apollonius was really scandalized at what he considered making me -
chandise of spiritual things (cf. the Drafache, chaps. XI. and X11. :
but even in the 19:dach, we find already a sort of stated salary pro
vided for the prophets; cf. chap. XII.).
For him to conclude,
however, from the practice instituted by the Montanists in accordance
with their other provisions for the formation of a compact organi
zation, that they were avaricious and gluttonous, is quite unjus
tifiable, just as much so as if our salaried clergy to-day should be
accused, as a class, of such sins.

Catholic in the sense in which the
word is used of the epistles of James, Peter, John, and Jude; that is,
general, addressed to no particular church. The epistle is no longer
extant.
Its "blasphemy" against the Lord and his apostles lay
undoubtedly in its statement of the fundamental doctrine of the
Montanists, that the age of revelation had not ceased, but that
through the promised Paraclete revelations were still given, which
supplemented or superseded those granted the apostle by Christ.

own, contending for words of empty sound, and
blaspheming against the Lord and the apostles

and the holy Church."

And again concerning others of those
honored among them as martyrs, he writes

as follows:

"Not to speak of many, let the prophetess
herself tell us of Alexander," who called himself
a martyr, with whom she is in the habit of ban
queting, and who is worshiped" by many. We
need not mention his robberies and other daring
deeds for which he was punished, but the
archives * contain them.
Which of these
forgives the sins of the other? Does the
prophet the robberies of the martyr, or the
martyr the covetousness of the prophet?
For
although the Lord said, ‘Provide neither gold,
nor silver, neither two coats,'" these men, in
complete opposition, transgress in respect to the
possession of the forbidden things.
For we will
show that those whom they call prophets and
martyrs gather their gain not only from rich
men, but also from the poor, and orphans,
and widows.

them stand up and discuss these matters,

But that those who wish may know con

account of the Name," but for the robberies
which he had committed, being already an apos

deceived the faithful that were there." And his

bad man, and that the Montanists had been deceived in him, as
often happens in all religious bodies.
Such a thing might much
more easily happen after the sect had been for a number of years in
a flourishing condition than in its earlier years; and the exactness
of the account, and the challenge to disprove it, would seem to lend
it some weight. At the same time Apollonius is clearly as unprin
cipled and dishonest a writer as the anonymous, and hence little re
liance can be placed upon any of his reports to the discredit of the
Montanists.
If the anonymous made so many accusations out of
whole cloth, Apollonius may have done the same in the present in
stance; and the fact that many still "worshiped" him would seem to
show that Apollonius' accusations, if they possessed any foundation,
were at any rate not proven.

SERAPION ON MONTANISM.

he relates that a dead man had, through the
Divine power, been raised by John himself in
Ephesus." He also adds other things by which
he fully and abundantly exposes the error of the
heresy of which we have been speaking.
These
are the matters recorded by Apollonius.

CHAPTER XIX.

Serapion on the Heresy of the Phrygians.

l

SERAPION," who, as report says, succeeded
Maximinus" at that time as bishop of the
church of Antioch, mentions the works of Apoli
narius * against the above-mentioned heresy.
And he alludes to him in a private letter to
Caricus and Pontius," in which he himself ex
poses the same heresy, and adds the following

words : *

hood throughout the world, I have sent you
writings" of the most blessed Claudius Apolina
rius, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia."

In the same letter of Serapion the signa
tures of several bishops are found, one of
whom subscribes himself as follows:

"I, Aurelius Cyrenius, a witness," pray for your

health."

And another in this manner:
"AElius Publius Julius," bishop of Debeltum,
a colony of Thrace. As God liveth in the
heavens, the blessed Sotas in Anchialus desired
to cast the demon out of Priscilla, but the hypo
crites did not permit him.""

And the autograph signatures of many
other bishops who agreed with them are
contained in the same letter.
So much for these persons.

"That you may see that the doings of
this lying band of the new prophecy, so
called, are an abomination to all the brother

* No one else, so far as I am aware, records this tradition, but
it is of a piece with many others in regard to John which were
afloat in the early Church.

* Both versions of the Chron. agree in putting the accession of
Serapion into the eleventh year of Commodus (190 A.D.), and that
of his successor Asclepiades into the first year of Caracalla, which
would give Serapion an i. of twenty-one years (Syncellus
says twenty-five years, although giving the same dates of accession
for both bishops that the other versions give). Serapion was a well
known person, and it is not too much to think that the dates given
by the Chron. in connection with him may be more reliable than
most of its dates. The truth is, that from the present chapter we
learn that he was already bishop before the end oft. reign,
i.e. before the end of 192 A.D. Were the statement of Eutychius, -
that Demetrius of Alexandria wrote at the same time to Maximus
of Antioch and Victor of Rome, - to be relied upon, we could fix
his accession between 189 and 192 (see Harmack's Zeit des Ig
natius, p. 45). But the truth is little weight can be attached to
his report. Wiii. we cannot therefore reach certainty in the mat
ter, there is no reason for doubting the approximate accuracy of
the date given by the Chron. As to the time of his death, we can fix
the date of Asclepiades' accession approximately in the year 211 (see
Bk. VI. chap. 11, note 6), and from the fragment of Alexander's
epistle to the Antiochenes, quoted in that chapter, it seems probable
that there had been a vacancy in the see of Antioch for some time.
But from the mention of Serapion's epistles to Domninus (Bk. VI.
chap. 12) we may gather that he lived until after the great persecu
tion of Severus (A.D. 202 sq.). From Bk. VI. chap. 12, we learn that
Serapion was quite a writer; and he is commemorated also by Je
rome (de vir. ill. c. 41) and by Socrates (//. F. III. 7).
In addi

as well as some other epistles, and a work on the Gospel of Peter.
These were the only writings of his which Eusebius had seen, but
he reports that there were probably other works extant. There are
preserved to us only the two fragments quoted by Eusebius in these
two chapters. Serapion also played a prominent rôle in the tradition
of the Edessene church, as we learn from Zahn's Doctrina Addai
(Gött. Gel. A no. 1877, St. 6, p. 173, 179, according to Harnack's

of the MSS. of Eusebius, but Pontius by one of the best of them,
by Nicephorus, Jerome, and Eusebius himself in Bk. VI. chap. 12,

Heinichen) are called in Bk. VI. chap. 12, ex-Amortaorrukovs a vöpas.
They are otherwise unknown personages. In that chapter the plural
article ré is used of the writing, or writings, addressed to Caricus
and Pontius, implying that umouviuara is to be supplied. This
seems to imply more than one writing, but it is not necessary to
conclude that more than the single epistle mentioned here is meant,
for the plural trouviuara was often used in a sort of collective sense
to signify a collection of notes, memoranda, &c.

CHAPTER XX.

The Writings of Irenaeus against the Schismatics
at Aeome.

IRENAEUs" wrote several letters against
those who were disturbing the sound ordi
nance of the Church at Rome. One of them
was to Blastus On Schism ; * another to Florinus

* See Bk. IV. chap. 27, note 5.
* Valesius justly remarks that Eusebius does not say that these
bishops iod Serapion's epistle, but only that their signatures
or notes (viroa muettooseus) were contained in the epistle. He thinks
it is by no means probable that a bishop of Thrace (the nationality
of the other bishops we do not know) should have signed this epistle
of Serapion's, and he therefore concludes that Serapion simply copies
from another epistle sent originally from Thrace. This is possible;
but at the end of the chapter Eusebius says that other bishops put
in their signatures or notes with their own hands (airóypaool
a muettagess), which precludes the idea that Serapion simply copies
their testimony from another source, and if they signed thus it is
ssible that the Thracian bishop did likewise. # may be that
Serapion took pains to compose a semi-official communication which
should have the endorsement of as many anti-Montanistic bishops as
F. and that, in order to secure their signatures he sent it about
rom one to the other before forwarding it to Caricus and Pontius.
It is possible
that he means to call himself simply a witness (uaprus) to the facts
recorded by Serapion in his epistle, but more probable that he uses
the word to indicate that he has "witnessed for Christ" under perse.
cution.
* AElius Publius Julius is also an otherwise unknown personage.
Debeltum and Anchialus were towns of Thrace, on the western
shore of the Black Sea.

* Of this Aurelius Cyrenius we know nothing.

"Lightfoot (Ignatius, II, 111) suggests that this Sotas (Sarās)
may be identical with the Zoticus (Zorkos) mentioned in the preced
ing chapter, the interchange of the initial X and Z being very common.
But we learn from chap. 16 that Zoticus was bishop of Comana, so
that he can hardly be identified with Sotas, bishop of Anchialus.

the opinions which Blastus held, but from Pseudo-Tertullian's Adv.
omnes Haer. chap. 8, we learn that Blastus was a Quartodeciman.
("In addition to all these, there is likewise Blastus, who would la
tently introduce Judaism. For he says the passover, is not to be
kept otherwise than according to the law of Moses, on the fourteenth
of the month.")
From Pacianus' Epistola ad Sympronian. de
catholico nomine, chap. 2, we learn that he was a Montanist; and
since the Montanists of Asia Minor were, like the other Christians
of that region, Quartodecimans, it is not surprising that Blastus
should be at the same time a Montanist .." a Quartodeciman.
Florinus, as will be shown in the next note, taught his heresies
while Victor was bishop of Rome (189-198 or 199); and since Euse
bius connects Blastus so closely with him, we may conclude that
Blastus flourished at about the same time.
Irenaeus' epistle to Blas
tus, On Schism, is no longer extant. A Syriac fragment of an
epistle of Irenaeus, addressed to "an Alexandrian," on the paschal

On Monarchy," or That God is not the Author
of Evil.
For Florinus seemed to be defending
this opinion. And because he was being drawn
away by the error of Valentinus, Irenaeus wrote
his work On the Ogdoad," in which he shows

was an Alexandrian, and in that case must have adopted the Quarto
deciman position under the influence of the Asiatic Montanists, for
the paschal calendar of the Alexandrian church was the same as
that of Rome (see the Dict. of Christ. Bros. III. p. 264).
If Blastus
was a Montanist, as stated by Pacianus, his heresy was quite different
from that of Florinus (who was a Gnostic); and the fact that they
were leaders of different heresies is confirmed by the words of
Eusebius in chap. 15, above: "Each one striving to introduce hos
ozon innovations in respect to the truth." Whether Blastus, like
Florinus, was a presbyter, and like him was deposed from his office,
we do not know, but the words of Eusebius in chap. 15 seem to
favor this supposition.

* Florinus, as we learn from chap. 15, was for a time a presbyter
of the Roman Church, but lost his office on account of heresy.
From the fragment of this epistle of Irenaeus to Florinus quoted by
Eusebius just below, we learn that Florinus was somewhat older
than Irenaeus, but like him a disciple of Polycarp. The title of this
epistle shows that Florinus was already a Gnostic, or at least in
j. toward Gnostic views.
Eusebius evidently had no direct
knowledge of the opinions of Florinus on the origin of evil, for
he says that he appeared to maintain (€60s et mpoao Irigetv) the
opinion that God was the author of evil.
Eusebius' conclusion is
accepted by most ancient and modern writers, but it is suggested by
Salmon (1)ict. of Christ. Biog. II. 544) that Eusebius was perhaps
mistaken, "for, since the characteristic of dualism is not to make
God the author of evil, but to clear him from the charge by ascrib
ing evil to an independent origin, the title would lead us to think
that the letter was directed, not against one who had himself held
God to be the author of evil, but against one who had charged the
doctrine of a single first principle with necessarily leading to this
conclusion. And we should have supposed that the object of Ire
naeus was to show that it was possible to assert God to t the sole
origin and ruler of the universe, without holding evil to be his work."
Since Eusebius had seen the epistle of Irenaeus to Florinus, it is diffi
cult to understand how he can have misconceived Florinus' position.
At the same time, he does not state it with positiveness; and the fact
that Florinus, if not already, certainly was soon afterward a Valen
tinian, and hence a dualist, makes Salmon's supposition very plausi
ble.
Florinus is not mentioned in Irenaeus' great work against
heresies, nor by Tertullian, Pseudo-Tertullian, Hippolytus, or Epi
phanius.
It is probable, therefore, that he was not named in Hip:
polytus' earlier work, nor in the lectures of Irenaeus which formed
the groundwork (see Salmon, 2.c.).
The silence of Irenaeus is
easily explained by supposing Florinus' fall into heresy to have
taken place after the composition of his lectures against heresies
and of o great work; and the silence of the later writers is prob
ably due to the fact that Irenaeus' work makes no mention of him,
and that, whatever his influence may have been during his lifetime,
it did not last, and hence his name attracted no particular attention
after his death.

It has been maintained by some (e.g. Lightfoot, in the Contem:
Aorary Review, 1875, p. 834) that this epistle to Florinus was one of
the earliest of Irenaeus' writings but Lipsius (191, f. of Christ. Biog.
III. 263) has given other and satisfactory reasons for thinking that
Florinus' heresy, and therefore Irenaeus' epistle, and his work. On
*/or Ogdoad, belonged to the time of Victor, and hence were later
than the work Against //e resics. A Syriac fragment of an epistle
concerning Florinus, addressed by Irenous to Victor (Harvey's edi
tion, Fragm. 28), is extant, and supports Lipsius' conclusion.
It
would seem that Irenaeus, subsequent to the writing of his great
work, learning that Florinus was holding heretical opinions on the
origin of evil, addressed him the epistle mentioned in this chapter.
That afterward, Florinus having embraced Valentinianism, and o:
ing written "an aboutinable book" (as the fragment just referred to
says), Irenaeus wrote his work On the Ogdoad, and subsequently
addressed his epistle to Victor, calling upon him to take decisive
measures against Florinus, now seen to be a regular heretic. What
was the result of Irenaeus' epistles and book we do not know; we
hear nothing more about the matter, nor do we know anything more
about Florinus (for Augustine's mention of Florinus as the founder
of a sect of Floriniani is a mistake; see Salmon, 1.c.).

* This treatise, On the Ogdoad, is no longer extant, though it is
robable that we have a few fragments of it (see Harvey, I. cloyi.).
The importance which I renaeus attached to this work is seen from
the solemn adjuration with which he closed it.
It must have been
largely identical in substance with the portions of his Adro. Harr.

more than an enlargement of those portions of the earlier work. The
Ogdoad (Greek, oyodas, a word signifying primarily a thing in eight
parts) occupied a prominent place in the speculations of the Gnos
tics.
Valentinus taught eight primary aeons, in four pairs, as the
root and origin of the other cons and of all beings. These eight he
called the first or primary Ogdoad ; and hence a work upon the
Ogdoad, written against a Valentinian, must, of course, be a general
discussion of the Valentinian doctrine of the aeons. The word Og

advent when he comes to judge the living and

to write this adjuration, and place it in the
copy."

These things may be profitably read in
his work, and related by us, that we may
have those ancient and truly holy men as the
best example of painstaking carefulness.

In the letter to Florinus, of which we
have spoken, Irenaeus mentions again his
intimacy with Polycarp, saying:

as he remembered their words, and what he

received them from eyewitnesses of the "Word

And this can be shown
plainly from the letters" which he sent,

Apollonius a Roman senator.
It is possible that this is only a nat
ural conclusion drawn by Jerome from Eusebius' statement that he

the city of Rome, a man renowned among the
faithful
for learning and philosophy, having
stirred up one of his servants, who was well
fitted for such a purpose, to accuse him."
But this wretched man made the charge
unseasonably, because by a royal decree
it was unlawful that informers of such things
should live. And his legs were broken imme
diately, Perennius the judge having pro
nounced this sentence upon him."
But the
martyr, highly beloved of God, being ear

defended himself before the Senate; and this possibility might seem
to be strengthened by the fact that Eusebius does not call him a
senator here, as we should expect him to do if he knew him to be
one. On the other hand, it is highly probable (as shown in the next
note) that Jerome had read the fuller account of Apollonius' martyr
don, included by Eusebius in his Collection of Martyrdoms, and
hence it seems likely that that account contained the statement that
Apollonius was a senator. Jerome makes Apollonius the author of
an insigne ro'o men, which he read in the Senate in defense of his
faith; but there seems to be no foundation for such a report.
It is
apparently the result simply of a misunderstanding of the words of
Eusebius, who states that Apollonius delivered before the Senate a
most eloquent defense of the faith, but does not imply that he wrote
an apology. The words that Eusebius uses at the close of this chap
ter imply rather that the defense made by Apollonius was recorded
after its delivery, and that it is this report of it which can be read in
his Collection of A/artyrdoms.

* Jerome, followed by Sophronius, reports that the accusation
against Apollonius was brought by a slave. Jerome gives the slave's
name as Severus (a servo Serero proditus); while Sophronius
makes Severus the name of the judge (Tapa too &ovaov Trapa Xe
Bnpo mpodobeis xptoriavos eva). The latter is impossible, how
ever, as the name of the judge was Perennius according to Eusebius.
Vallarsi states that some MSS. of Jerome read sub Commodo prin
cipe ac Severo proditus, and supposes that ac Severo is a corrup
tion for the words a servo (which he thinks may have stood alone in
the original text), and that some student, perceiving the error, wrote
upon the margin of his copy the words a servo, and that subse:
quently the note crept into the text, while the word Serero was still
retained, thus producing our present reading a servo Sezero. This
is an ingenious suggestion, but the fact is overlooked that Sophronius
undoubtedly read in the original translated by him the words a servo
Severo, for we can explain his rendering only by supposing that he
read thus, but understood the word Serero as the dative of the indirect
object after proditus, instead of the ablative in apposition with servo.
In the face of Sophronius' testimony to the original form of the text,
no alteration of the common reading can be accepted. As to the
source of Jerome's Severus, since id: is nothing in the present
chapter of Eusebius to suggest such an addition, and no reason can
be imagined for the independent insertion of the name, the only le
gitimate conclusion seems to be, that the name occurred in the ac
count of Apollonius' martyrdom referred to by Eusebius just below,
If this be so, then that martyrolog

must have been the authority also for Jerome's statement that §§
lonius was accused by a slave; and hence the statement may be
accepted as true, and not as the result of a misinterpretation of the
reference of Eusebius' words (eva Yé Tuva row eis Taura
murmö, tow
airo), as supposed by some.
Since it is thus almost certain that
Jerome had himself examined the fuller account of Apollonius' nar
tyrdom, referred to by Eusebius, a favorable light, is thrown back
upon his report that Apollonius was a senator, and it becomes prob
able that he obtained this statement from the same source (see the
previous note).

* M. de Mandajors, in his Histoire de l'Acad.des Inscript. tom.
18, p. 226 (according to Gieseler's Ch. Hist., Harper's edition, I.
p. 127), "thinks that the slavc was put to death as the betrayer of
his master, according to an old law renewed by Trajan; but that
the occurrence had been misunderstood by the Christians, and had
given rise to the tradition, which is found in Tertullian and in the
Za'ictrom ad Comm. Asia", that an emperor at this period had de
creed the punishment of death for denouncing a Christian." Such a
law against the denunciation of masters by slaves was passed under
Nerva; but Gieseler remarks that, in accordance with the principles
of the laws upon this subject, "either Apollonius only, or his slave
only, could have been put to death, but in no case both. Jerome
does not say either that Severus was the slave of Apollonius, or that
he was executed; and since Eusebius grounds this execution ex
pressly on a supposititious law, it may have belonged only to the
Oriental tradition, which may have ...'. this instance in support
of the alleged law."
It is possible that Gieseler is right in this con
clusion; but it is also quite possible that Eusebius' statement that
the slave was executed is correct. The ground of the execution was,
of course, not, as Eusebius thinks, the fact that he brought an accu
sation against a Christian, but, as remarked by de Mandajors, the
fact that, being a slave, he betrayed his master. Had the informant
been executed because he brought an accusation against a Christian,
the subsequent execution of the latter would be inexplicable. But

CHAPTER XXII.

The Bishops that were well known at this 77me.

IN the tenth year of the reign of Commodus,
Victor' succeeded Eleutherus," the latter having

it is conceivable that the prefect Perennius may have sentenced the
informant to death, in accordance with the old law mentioned by de
Mandajors, and that then, Apollonius being a senator, he may have
requested him to appear before that body, and make his defense to
them, in order that he might pass judgment upon him in accordance
with the decision of the Senate.
It is quite conceivable that, the
emperor being inclined to favor the Christians, Perennius may not
have cared to pass judgment against Apollonius until he had learned
the opinion of the Senate on the matter (cf. what Neander has to say
on the subject, in his Ch. Hist.). As remarked by Walesius, the
Senate was not a judicial court, and hence could not itself sentence
Apollonius; but it could, of course, communicate to the prefect its
opinion, and he could then pass judgment accordingly.
It is signifi
cant that the Greek reads agaw &mo 56Yuaros avyxAñrov, inserting
the particle oráv, "as if"; i.e. "as if by decree of the Senate."
* Walesius thinks the reference here is to Pliny's rescript to Tra
i. (see above, Bk. III. chap. 33).
This is possible, though the
anguage of Eusebius seems to imply a more general reference to all
kinds of cases, not simply to the cases of Christians.

• On Eusebius' great Collection of Martyrdoms, which is now
lost, see above, p. 30.
* The dates assigned to Victor'so by the ancient authori
ties ...'. . Eusebius here puts his accession in the tenth
year of Commodus (i.e. 189 A.D.), and this is accepted by Lipsius as
the correct date. Jerome's version of the Chron. puts his accession
in the reign of Pertinax, or the first year of Septimius Severus (i.e.
193), while the Armenian version puts it in the seventh year of Com
modus (186). Eusebius, in his //; story, does not state directly the
duration of his episcopate, but in chap. 28 he says that Zephyrinus
succeeded him about the ninth year of Severus, i.e. according to his
erroneous reckoning (see Bk. VI. chap. 21, note 3) about 200, which
would give Victor an episcopate of about eleven years. Jerome, in
his version of the Chrom. and in his de zir. 'W., assigns him ten
ears; the Armenian version of the Chron, twelve years.
The
iberian Catalogue makes his episcopate something over nine years
Lipsius, consid
long; the Felician Catalogue something over ten.
ering Victor in connection with his successors, concludes that he
held office between nine and ten years, and therefore gives as his
dates 189-198 or 199 (see p. 172 sq.).
According to an anonymous
writer quoted in chap. 28, Victor excommunicated Theodotus of
Byzantium for teaching that Christ was a mere man. He is best
known, however, on account of his action in connection with the
great Quartodeciman controversy (see chap. 24).
Jerome, in his
version of the Chron., says of him cufus mediocria de religione
e-rtant 'olu orna, and in his de 7.1 r. ss... chap. 34, he tells us that
he wrote upon the passover, and also some other works (super
guastione Paschae, et alia ouardam scribens of uscula). Har
nack believes that he has discovered one of these works (all of
which have been supposed lost) in the Pseudo-Cyprianic de Alra
torious.
In his Terte und. Unters. Bd. V. Heft I, he has discussed
the subject in a very learned and ingenious manner. The theo
has much to commend it, but there are difficulties in its way whic
have not yet been removed; and I am inclined to think it a product
of the first half of the third century, rather than of the last quarter of

walde utilem composuit epistolam); but it seems to have been no
longer extant in his time, for in mentioning it and the epistle of
Bacchylus of Corinth and others in his Chron., he says that the

Bagchylus
also is prominent solely on account of his connection with the pas
chal controversy. According to the next chapter, he was himself
the author of an epistle on the subject, which he wrote, according to
Jerome (de vir. ill. c. 44), in the name of all the bishops of Achaia
(e.v omnium zui in A chara e rant episcoporu on Aersona).
But
the words of Eusebius seem to imply that the epistle was an indi
vidual, not a synodical one, for he does not say, "an epistle of those
in," &c., as he does in every other case. We must conclude, there
fore, that Jerome, who ...? not seen the epistle, was mistaken in
making it a synodical letter. Jerome characterizes it as an elegant
composition (elegantent forum); but, like the epistle of Theophilus,
mentioned in the preceding note, it seems not to have been extant in
#. time. The dates of Bacchylus' accession to office and of
is death are not known to us.
9 Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, is one of the most noted men
connected with the paschal controversy, for the reason that he was
the leader of the bishops of the province of Asia, in which province
alone the Quartodeciman practice was uniformly observed. He was
thus the leading opponent of Bishop Victor of Rome.
His relation
to the paschal controversy is brought out more fully in chap. 24.
The dates of Polycrates' accession to office and of his death are
not known to us; though, of course, with Theophilus, Narcissus,
Bacchylus, and the other bishops concerned in the paschal contro
versy, he flourished during the reign of Septimius Severus, while
Victor was bishop of Rome. The only writing of Polycrates of
which we know is his epistle to Victor, a portion of which is quoted
by Eusebius, in Bk. III. chap. 31, and a still larger portion in chap.
24 of this book.
Jerome, in his de vir, ill. c. 45, speaks, in terms of the highest
praise of Polycrates, and quotes #on Eusebius the larger fragment,
given in chap. 24, adding, Harc Aroffered fosur, tet ingenium et

knew, no longer extant.

The Question then agitated concerning the
Aassover.

l

A QUESTION of no small importance arose
at that time. For the parishes of all Asia, as

moned by him to discuss the paschal question. The fact that both
Eusebius and Jerome praise Polycrates so highly, and testify to his
orthodoxy, shows how completely the paschal question had been
buried before their time, and how little §. Quartodeciman practice
was feared.

* The great question of dispute between the church of Asia
Minor and the rest of Christendom was whether the paschal com
munion should be celebrated on the fourteenth of Nisan, or on the
Sunday of the resurrection festival, without regard to Jewish chro
nology. The Christians of Asia Minor, appealing to the example of
the apostles, John and Philip, and to the uniform practice of the
Church, celebrated the Christian passover always on the fourteenth
of Nisan, whatever day of the week that might ło, by a solemn fast,
and closed the day with the communion in commemoration of the
last paschal supper of Christ. The Roman church, on the other
hand, followed o all the rest of Christendom, celebrated the death
of Christ always on Friday, and his resurrection on the Sunday sol:

fast of . Asiatic Christians, terminating, as it did, with the four
teenth of Nisan, often closed some days before the fast of the other
churches, and the lack of uniformity occasioned great scandal. As
Schaff says: "The gist of the paschal controversy was, whether the
Jewish paschal day (be it a Friday or not) or the Christian Sunday
should control the idea and time of the entire festival." The former
ractice emphasized Christ's death; the latter his resurrection. The
#. discussion of the question took place between Polycarp and
Anicetus, bishop of Rome, when the ło, was on a visit to that
city, between 150 and 155.

practice of observing the 14th of Sisa. but could not persuade Ani
cetus to do the same, nor could Anicetus persuade him not to ob
serve that day. They nevertheless communed together in Rome,
and separated in peace. About 17o A.D. the controversy broke out
again in Laodicea, the chief disputants being Melito of Sardis and
Apolinarius of Hierapolis (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 26, note 1, and
chap. 27, note 1).
In this controversy Melito advocated the tradi
tional Asiatic custom of observing the fourteenth day, while Apoli
narius opposed it. To distinguish two parties of Quartodecimans,
- a Judaizing and a more orthodox, - as must be done if Apolina:
rius is regarded, as he is by many, as a Quartodeciman, is, as Schaff
shows, entirely unwarranted.
e know only of the one party, and
Apolinarius did not belong to it. The third stage of the controversy,
:#;"| took place while Victor was bishop of Rome, in the last dec
ade of the second century, was much more bitter and important.
The leaders of the two sides were Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, and
Victor, bishop of Rome, - the latter an overbearing man, who be
lieved that he, as Bishop of Rome, had a right to demand of all
other churches conformity to the practices of his own church. The
controversy canne to an o rupture between the churches of Asia
and that of Rome, but other churches did not sympathize with the
severe measures of Victor, and the breach was gradually healed,
-just how and when we do not know; but the Roman practice
so prevailed over the Asiatic, and finally, at the Council of
Nicaea, (325), was declared binding upon the whole Church, while
the old Asiatic practice was condemned. This decision was acqui
esced in by the bishops of Asia, as well as by the rest of the world,
and only scattered churches continued to cling to the practice of the
earlier Asiatics, and they were branded as heretics, and called Quar
to decimanians (from Quarta decima), a name which we carry back
and apply to all who observed the fourteenth day, even those of the
second and third centuries. This brief summary will enable us bet
ter to understand the accounts of Eusebius, who is our chief author
ity on the subject. The paschal controversy has had an important
bearing upon the question of the authenticity of the fourth Gospel,

in the rest of the world to end it at this time,
as they observed the practice which, from apos
tolic tradition, has prevailed to the present time,
of terminating the fast on no other day than on
that of the resurrection of our Saviour.

Synods and assemblies of bishops were
held on this account," and all, with one
consent, through mutual correspondence drew
up an ecclesiastical decree, that the mystery of
the resurrection of the Lord should be cele
brated on no other but the Lord's day, and
that we should observe the close of the paschal
fast on this day only.
There is still extant a
writing of those who were then assembled in
Palestine, over whom Theophilus," bishop of
Caesarea, and Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem,
presided.
And there is also another writing
extant of those who were assembled at Rome
to consider the same question, which bears the
name of Bishop Victor; "also of the bishops in

cannot be discussed here, but the reader is referred, for a brief state
ment of the case, to Schaff's Ch. Hist. II. 219. The Johannine con
troversy has given rise to an extensive literature on these paschal
disputes. Among the most important works are Hilgenfeld's Der
Pascha streit der alten Kirche mach seiner Bedeutung fur die
Kirchengesch. u. s. v.; and Schürer's Die Paschastrestigkeiten
des zweiten 9ahrhunderts, in the Zeitschrist /iir hist. Theologie,
1870, P. 182-284, - the latter perhaps the ablest extended discus
sion of the subject extant. The reader is also referred to the article
Easter, in Smith's Dict. of Christ. Ant., to Hefele's Concilien
gesch. i. p. §oor, and especially to the chapter on the paschal
controversies in Schaff's Ch. Hist. Vol. II. p. 209-220. This chap
ter of Schaff's is the clearest, and, in the opinion of the writer, b
far o most satisfactory, brief statement of the whole subject whic

we nave.

* Although other synods are mentioned by the Libellus synodi.
cus (of the ninth century), the only ones which we have good rea
son for accepting are those mentioned by Eusebius in this chapter
and the next; viz. one in Palestine (the Libellus synodicus gives
two: one at Jerusalem, presided over by Narcissus, and another at
Caesarea, presided over § Theophilus, but the report is too late to
be of authority); one in Pontus, under, the presidency of Palmas;
one in Gaul, under Irenaeus; one in Osrhoëne in Mesopotamia; and
one in Asia Minor, under Polycrates.
Hesele (Concillengesch. I.
p. 101) adds one in Rome under Victor; and although Eusebius does
not distinctly mention such a synod, we are undoubtedly to conclude
that the epistle written by Victor was a synodical epistle, and hence
Hesele is, in all probability, correct in assuming that some kind of a
synod, whether municipal or provincial, took place there at this time
(see note 4). From the words of Eusebius, at the close of the chap
ter, we may gather that still other synods than those mentioned by
him were held on this subject. The date of all of these councils is
commonly given as 198 A.D., but there is no particular authority for
that year. Jerome's version of the Chron, assigns the composition
of the various epistles to the fourth year of Septimius Severus (196197); but it is . that he is giving only an approximate date. We
can say only that the synods took place sometime during Victor's
episcopate. "All the councils, as we learn from this chapter, except
the one under Polycrates in Asia Minor, decided against the Quar
todeciman practice.
Athanasius, however (de Syn., c. 5), speaks of
Christians of Syria, Cilicia, and Mesopotamia as celebrating the pas
chal feast on the fourteenth day; and Jerome (de vor. ii., c. o
says that many bishops of Asia and of the Orient kept up this ob
servance.
It is possible that the practice was from the beginning
more widely spread than Eusebius supposed, or, what is more prob
able, that the words of Athanasius and Jerome refer to individual
churches and bishops, whose observance of the fourteenth day was
not general enough to invalidate what Eusebius says of the common
consent of the whole Church, outside of Asia Minor, against the
Quartodeciman practice, and that this individual observance, not be
ing officially recognized by any synod, did not seem to him to re
quire inention.

The Disagreement in Asia.

l

BUT the bishops of Asia, led by Polycra
tes, decided to hold to the old custom
handed down to them." He himself, in a letter
which he addressed to Victor and the church of
Rome, set forth in the following words the tradi
tion which had come down to him : *

"We observe the exact day; neither add
ing, nor taking away. For in Asia also great
lights have fallen asleep, which shall rise again on
the day of the Lord's coming, when he shall come
with glory from heaven, and shall seek out all
the saints. Among these are Philip, one of the
twelve apostles, who fell asleep in Hierapolis;
and his two aged virgin daughters, and another
daughter, who lived in the Holy Spirit and
now rests at Ephesus; and, moreover, John,
who was both a witness and a teacher, who
reclined upon the bosom of the Lord, and, being
a priest, wore the sacerdotal plate.
He
fell asleep at Ephesus. And Polycarp * in
Smyrna, who was a bishop and martyr; and
Thraseas," bishop and martyr from Eumenia,

chap. 22, note 6).
Heinichen is certainly wrong in making this
epistle an individual letter from Victor alone, for Eusebius expressly
says that the epistle was from "those at Rome" (row emi 'Pouns),
which seems to imply a council, as in the other cases. The gram.
matical construction naturally leads us to supply with the row the
word used with it in the previous sentence, a vyrexpotnue vov, -
" those who were assembled."
Walesius, Hesele, and others are,
therefore, quite justified in assuming that, according to Eusebius, a
synod met at Rome, also, at this time:

* Palmas, bishop of Amastris, in Pontus, mentioned by Diony

sius, in Bk. IV. chap. 23, above.

• Osrhoene was a region of country in northwestern Mesopo

tarnia.

* This epistle of Bacchylus is distinguished from the preceding
ones by the fact that it is not a synodical or collective epistle, but
the io production of one man, if Eusebius' report is correct
(see the preceding chapter, note 8). The epistles "of many others,"
mentioned in the next sentence, may have been of the same kind.

* Namely, against the observance of the fourteenth day.

ceding chapter, note 1. On Polycrates, see chap. 22, note 9.

* A part of this passage from Polycrates' epistle is quoted in Bk.
III. chap. 31. The extract given there begins with the second sen

For comments upon
this portion of the fragment, see the notes given there.
On Polycarp, see Bk. IV. chap. 14, note 5.

* This Thraseas, said by Polycrates to ive been bishop of
Eumenia (a city in the o part of Phrygia), was mentioned
also by Apollonius in his work against the Montanists (according to
Eusebius, chap. 18, § 13, of this book). He is called by Polycrates
a martyr, and by Eusebius, in reference to Apollonius' mention of
him, "one of the martyrs of that time." There is no reason to
doubt that he was a martyr, in the full sense, as Polycarp was; but

that I did not bear my gray hairs in vain, but had
always governed my life by the Lord Jesus."
Thereupon Victor, who presided over the
church at Rome, immediately attempted to
cut off from the common unity the parishes of
all Asia, with the churches that agreed with
them, as heterodox; and he wrote letters and de

* A careful exegesis of the passages in John's Gospel, which are
supposed by some to contradict the synoptic account, and to put
Christ's death on the fourteenth day of Nisan instead of on the fifteenth,
shows that John agrees with the Synoptists in putting the passover
meal on the fourteenth and the o of Christ on the fifteenth (see
Schaff's Ch. Hist, Vol.I. p. 133 ff., and the authorities referred to by
him). The Asiatic churches, in observing the fourteenth of Nisan, were
commemorating the last passover feast and the death of the paschal
Lamb. Their practice did not imply that they believed that Christ
died on the fourteenth (as can be seen from fragments of Apolina
rius' work quoted in the Chron. Pascha/e, and referred to above;
see, also, Schaff, Vol. II. p. 214). They were in full agreement
with all four Gospels in putting his death on the fifteenth.
But the
paschal controversy did not hinge on the day of the month on which
Christ died, - in regard to which there was no widespread disagree
ment, - but on the question as to whether a particular day of the
week or of the month was to be celebrated.

* i.e. the Jews. The passover feast among the Jews took place
on the evening of the fourteenth of Nisan, and was eaten with un
leavened bread (Ex. xii. 6 et passim).
It was on the fourteenth of
Nisan, therefore, that the Jews "threw away" the leaven, and
until the evening of the twenty-first, when the seven days' feast of
unleavened bread closed, they used no leaven.

* Acts v. 29.
* According to this, the Asiatic Council was summoned at the
request of Victor of Rome, and in all probability this was the case
with all the councils referred to in the last chapter.

EPISTLE OF IRENAEUS TO VICTOR.

cate."
But this did not please all the bish
ops. And they besought him to consider
the things of peace, and of neighborly unity and
love.
Words of theirs are extant, sharply
rebuking Victor. Among them was Irenaeus,
who, sending letters in the name of the
brethren in Gaul over whom he presided, main
tained that the mystery of the resurrection of
the Lord should be observed only on the Lord's
day.
He fittingly admonishes Victor that he
should not cut off whole churches of God which
observed the tradition of an ancient custom,
and after many other words he proceeds as

follows:"

"For the controversy is not only concern
ing the day, but also concerning the very
manner of the fast.
For some think that they
should fast one day, others two, yet others more;
some, moreover, count their day as consist
ing of forty hours day and night." And this
variety in its observance has not originated
in our time; but long before in that of our an
It is likely that they did not hold to
cestors."

12 There has been considerable discussion as to whether Victor
actually excommunicated the Asiatic churches or only threatened to
o so.
Socrates (H. E. W. 22) says directly that he excommuni
cated them, but many have thought that Eusebius does not say it.
For my part, I cannot understand that Eusebius' words mean any
thing else than that he did actually cut off communion with them.
The Greek reads fixotvovirous mávras āpānu rous éketoe divaknpur
Tuv &6=Abous.

This seems to me decisive.

in This epistle is no longer extant, but in addition to the frag
ments given in this chapter by Eusebius, a few other extracts from
it are found in other writers; thus, in the Pseudo-Justinian Quaes
tiones et responsa ad orthodoros occurs a quotation from Ire
naeus' work On Easter (Tept room dioxa), which is doubtless to be
identified with this epistle to Victor (ed. Harvey, Graec. /ragon.
7; Eng. translation in Ante-Nicene Fathers, I. p. 569). Maxi
mus of Turin, also, in his Sermo PIV. de EZee mos., gives a brief
quotation from "The epistle to Victor" (Harvey, Graec. fragm.
It is possible that some other unnamed fragments
5, trans. iśāţ.).
iven by Harvey are from this epistle. From Eusebius' words we
earn that Irenaeus agreed with Victor as to the proper time of keep
ing the feast, and yet he did not agree with him in his desire to ex
communicate those who followed the other practice.

* The punctuation of this sentence is a disputed matter. Some
editors omit the semicolon after the words "yet others more," trans
lating, "For some think that they should fast one day, others two,
yet others, more, and some forty; and they count the hours of the
day and night together as their day." The sense is thus materially
changed, but the Greek seems to necessitate rather the punctua
tion which I have followed in my translation, and so that punc
tuation is adopted by Valesius, %m. Burton, Schwegler,
Laemmer, Heinichen, Closs, Cruse, and others. We should expect,
moreover, that the forty hours' fast should be mentioned in this
connection by Irenaeus, as we learn from Tertullian that it was very
common; whereas we have no other trace of the forty days' fast at
so early a date (cf. the next note).
* The fast preceding the celebration of the paschal supper, which
has grown gradually into our Lent of forty days o; Easter,
is, we are told here by Irenaeus, much older than his day.
It is thus
carried back at least close to apostolic times, and there is no reason
to think that it was not observed about as soon as the celebration of

the paschal supper itself was established.
the fast, which continued, according to him (de jounio, chap, 2),
during the period "in which the bridegroom was taken away," i.e.
in which Jesus was under the power of death.
We learn from this passage of Irenaeus' epistle that the duration
of the fast varied ... From Socrates (H. E. W. 22) and Sozo
men (A/. E. VII. 19) we learn that the variation was as great in
their time. Some fasted three, some six, some seven weeks, and so
Socrates (?.c.) informs us that the fast, whatever its duration,

was always called reororapakoors (quadrogesima). He does not
know why this is, but says that various reasons are given by others.
The time between Jesus' death and his resurrection was very early
computed as forty hours in length, - from noon of Friday to four
o'clock Sunday morning.
This may have lain at the basis of the
number sorty, which was so persistently used to designate the fast,
for Tertullian tells us that the fast was intended to cover the period

one another; and the disagreement in regard to
the fast confirms the agreement in the faith."
He adds to this the following account,

which I may properly insert:

"Among these were the presbyters before So
ter, who presided over the church which thou now
rulest. We mean Anicetus, and Pius, and Hygi
nus, and Telesphorus, and Xystus. They neither
observed it" themselves, nor did they permit
those after them to do so. And yet though not
observing it, they were none the less at peace
with those who came to them from the parishes
in which it was observed ; although this observ
ance was more opposed to those who did
not observe it." But none were ever cast
out on account of this form ; but the pres
byters before thee who did not observe it, sent
the eucharist to those of other parishes who
observed it." And when the blessed Poly
carp was at Rome" in the time of Anicetus,

of Moses, of Elijah, and of Jesus in the desert would also of course
have great influence in determining the length of this, the most im
portant fast of the year. Already before the end of the third century
the fast had extended itself in many quarters to cover a number of
weeks, and in the time of Eusebius the forty days' fast had already
become a common thing (see his de Pasch. chap. 5), and even Origen
refers to it (Homo. in Lezo. X. 2). The present duration of the fast
-forty days exclusive of Sundays-was fixed in the seventh or
eighth century.

1" i.e. the fourteenth day.
17 The Greek reads: kai to ua AAov čvavriov

v to ripet v Tots
wn ripodov. The meaning is, that the observance of the fourteenth
day by these strangers in Rome itself, among those who did not ob
serve that day, would be noticeable and more distasteful than the
mere report §: the day was so observed in Asia could be.
If Vic
tor's predecessor, therefore, allowed such persons to observe that
day even in Rome, how much more should he allow the Asiatics to
observe it in their own land.

* Valesius, sollowed by others, interprets this sentence as mean
ing that the presbyters of Rome sent the eucharist to other parishes
where the paschal festival was observed on the fourteenth of the
month. The council of Laodicea (Can. 14) forbade the sending of
the eucharist to other parishes, which shows that the custom must
have been widespread before the end of the fourth century, and it is
therefore quite possible that the bishops of Rome, even as early as
the time of Irenaeus, pursued the same practice.
But in regard to
the statement made here by Irenaeus, it must be said that, so far as
we are able to ascertain, only the churches of Asia Minor observed
the fourteenth day at that early date, and it is difficult to imagine
that the presbyters of Rome before Victor's time had been in the
habit of sending the eucharist all the way from Rome to Asia Minor.
Moreover, this is the only passage in which we have notice, before
the fourth century, of the existence of the general practice con
demned by the council of Laodicea. The Greek reads of mpo o ow
moea Burepot rols dro Tov m apotktov Tripovo to one utor toxaplotta v.
These words taken by themselves can as well, if not better, be un
derstood of persons (whether presbyters or others is not in any case
distinctly stated) who had come to Rome from other parishes, and
who continued to observe the fourteenth day. This transmission of
the eucharist to communicants who were kept away from the service
by illness or other adequate, cause was a very old custom, being
mentioned by Justin Martyr in his Apol. I. 65.
It is true that it is
difficult to understand why Irenaeus should speak in the present case
of sending the eucharist to those persons who observed the fourteenth
day, instead of merely mentioning the fact that the Roman church
communed with them.
In the face of the difficulties on both sides it
must be admitted that neither of the interpretations mentioned can
be insisted upon. On the practice of sending the eucharistic bread
to persons not present at the service, or to other parishes, see the
article Eulogia, in Smith's Dict. of Christ. Amt.

and they disagreed a little about certain other
things, they immediately made peace with one
another, not caring to quarrel over this matter.
For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp
not to observe what he had always observed with
John the disciple of our Lord, and the other
apostles with whom he had associated; neither
could Polycarp persuade Anicetus to observe it,
as he said that he ought to follow the customs
of the presbyters that had preceded him.
But though matters were in this shape, they
communed together, and Anicetus con
ceded the administration of the eucharist in the
church to Polycarp, manifestly as a mark of re
spect."
And they parted from each other in
peace, both those who observed, and those who
did not, maintaining the peace of the whole

church."

Thus Irenaeus, who truly was well named,"
became a peacemaker in this matter, ex
horting and negotiating in this way in behalf
of the peace of the churches. And he con
ferred by letter about this mooted question, not
only with Victor, but also with most of the other
rulers of the churches."

Walesius understands Ire
naeus' meaning to be that Anicetus, invited Polycarp to administer
the eucharist in Rome; and this is the common interpretation of the
Heinichen objects, however, that it apexopmorew thv eixa
passage.
to Tav cannot refer to the administration of the sacrament, and
ence concludes that Irenaeus means simply to say that Anicetus
permitted Polycarp to partake of the eucharist in his church, thereb
roclaiming publicly their fraternal fellowship, in spite of their .
erences on the paschal question. The common interpretation, how
ever, seems to the writer better than Heinichen's; for if the latter be
adopted, the sentence in question says no more, than the one which
"they communod with each other" (oxotroroga,
precedes it,
tavross). And moreover, as Walesius remarks, Anicetus would in
that case have shown Polycarp no more honor than any other Chris
tian pilgrim who might happen to be in Rome. Irenaeus seems to
intend to say that Anicetus showed Polycarp especial honor, and
that in spite of their difference of opinion on the paschal question.
But simply to have allowed Polycarp to partake of the eucharist in
the . would certainly have been no honor, and, on the other
hand, not to invite him to assist in the administration of the sacra
ment might have seemed a sign of disrespect, and have emphasized
their differences. The old interpretation, therefore, must be fol
lowed, and so far as the Greek is concerned, there is no difficulty
about the construction.
In the mapexop morev resides the idea of
" yielding," "giving place to"; and so Anicetus yielded to Polycarp
the eucharist, or gave place to him in the matter of the eucharist.
This in fact brings out the force of the mapex.opm.gev better than
Heinichen's interpretation.

35) makes two works out of this: one Against the Gentiles, and
another On Knowledge (et contra Gentes volument &reze, et de

arvey (I. p. clxvi.) states that one of the
Syriac fragments of Irenaeus' works mentions the work of Eusebius
On Knowledge, and specifies that it was directed against the Valen
tinians.
In that case it would be necessary to make two separate
works, as Jerome does, and so Harvey thinks that the text of Euse
bius must be amended by the insertion of an āAAos Té. Unfortu
nately, Harvey did not name the Syriac fragment which contains
the statement referred to, and it is not to be found among those col
lected in his edition (Venables, in Smith and Wace, states that he
could find no such fragment, and is have is searched in vain for it).
Evidently some blunder has been committed, and it looks as is Har
vey's statement were unverifiable.
Meanwhile, Jerome's testimony
alone is certainly not enough to warrant an emendation of the text
in o to all the MSS. and versions. We must therefore
conclude, with our present light, that the treatise nepi ém to Triums
was directed against the Greeks, as Eusebius says. The work has

The Works of Others that flourished at that
Time.

NUMEROUS memorials of the faithful zeal of the
ancient ecclesiastical men of that time are still
preserved by many. Of these we would note
particularly the writings of Heraclitus' On the
Apostle, and those of Maximus on the question
so much discussed among heretics, the Origin
of Evil, and on the Creation of Matter."
Also

Pertinax, who immediately oied him, was murdered, on
March 28, 193, by the Praetorian guard, which then sold the impe
rial power to Didius Julianus, who, at the approach of Septimius
Severus, who had been proclaimed emperor § the Pannonian le
gions, was declared a public enemy by the Senate, and beheaded
after a reign of only sixty-six days.
1 This Heraclitus is mentioned only by Eusebius and by Jerome
§ zor. ill, chap. 46), who, in his description of him and in the five
ollowing chapters (on Maximus, Candidus, Apion, Sextus, and
Arabianus), does nothing more than repeat the words of Eusebius
in this chapter. The work which Eusebius calls ra 'Hpakae trou ets
Tov and groxov is called by Jerome in apostolum Commentarios.
The word āmāorroMos was quite commonly used among the Fathers
to denote the epistles of Paul (see Suicer's Thesaurus), and hence
Eusebius seems here to refer to commentaries (the plural article Tă
is used) on the Pauline epistles. These commentaries are no longer
extant, and we know nothing of their nature.

.

* The Greek reads kai rā Mačiuov wept row moxv6pwamrov mapá
m xakta, kai mept too yewm
rols atpea totals &mrijuaros, too m offew
row wrapyet v Thy wany. The plural rā (sc. wrouvnuara) might lead
us to suppose Eusebius refers here to separate works, were it not
for the fact that in his Praep. Evang. VII. 22 is found a long extract
from a work of Maximus On Matter (nepi rins vams) in which
the subject of the origin of evil is discussed in connection with the
origin and nature of matter.
In that age one could hardly discuss
the origin of evil without at the same time discussing matter, to
which the origin of evil was referred by the great majority of the
ancients. We are to suppose, then, that the work of M. bore
the double title given by Eusebius in this chapter. Jerome in his
de fir, ill...chap. 47, says: Marimus .
. samosam quaestionent
insigni volumine ventilavit, unde malum, et quod, materia a
Deo facta sit. As remarked above, a long extract, which must have
been taken from this work, is given by Eusebius in his Prof. Avang.
It appears from this extract that the work was written in the form
of a dialogue between three speakers, - two inquirers, and one or
thodox Christian. The same fragment of Maximus' work is found
also in the twenty-fourth chapter of the Philocalia of Origen, and is
said by the editors, Gregory and Basil, to have been copied by them
from Eusebius' work. The Dialogue on Free Wril, ascribed to
Methodius (of the early part of the fourth century), made large use
of this work of Maximus; and the same is to be said of the Pseudo
Origenistic Dialogue against the Marcionites, though according to
Routh (Ref. Sac. II. p. 79) the latter drew his quotations from Me
thodius and not directly from Maximus. The work of Methodius
undoubtedly contains much more of Maximus' work than is given
here by Eusebius; but it is difficult to ascertain what is his own and
what belongs to Maximus, and Routh, in publishing the fragments
of Maximus' work (??id. p. 87-107), gives only the extract quoted
In his Praep. Evang. Eusebius speaks of Maximus as
Tns xptorov čvarp, Bns oux ào muos a vmp, but we know no more about
him than has been already indicated.
Gallandius suggests that he
may be identical with Maximus, the twenty-sixth bishop of Jeru
is quite probable, lived
salem
about this time (cf. Eusebius' Chron, year of Abr. 22.02).
But
Eusebius, neither in this chapter nor in his Praef. Errang., calls
Maximus a bishop, and it seems proper to conclude that he at least
did not know that he was a bishop; and hence Gallandius' conjec
ture, which rests only upon agreement in a very common name,
must be pronounced quite baseless.

article, implying a noun understood, and referring to the six days'
work of creation (see Suiger's Thesazarus). The subject was quite
a favorite one with the Fathers.
Hippolytus, Basil, Gregory of
Nyssa, Ambrose, and others wrote, upon it, as did also the Apion
mentioned in the next sentence. The work of Candidus is no longer
oxtant, nor do we know anything more about it and its author than
Eusebius, tells us hero. The plural rā occurs again, and Jerome
supplies tractatus. . Whether the word fitly describes the work, or
works, or whether they were rather of the nature of homilies, like
Basil's, we do not know. Sophronius, in translating Jerome, puts
out Atas for tractatus, but this of course is of no authority.
* Apion's work is mentioned also by §§. (de vior, ill. chap. 4),
but nothing is added to the statement of Eusebius. We know noth
ing more about him or his work.

Sextus also is mentioned by Jerome, in his de vir, fl. chap.
o, but we know nothing about him or his work, except what Euse
ius tells us here.

* Nothing more is known of this Arabianus, and Eusebius does
not even tell us the name of his work.
His silence is difficult to
explain. We can hardly imagine that the title was intentionally
omitted; for had there been a reason for such a course, there must
have becn as much reason for omitting the writer's name also.
It
does not seem probable that he had never known the title of the
book, for he was not in the habit of mentioning works which he had
not seen, except with the formula Adyos exec, or something of the
kind, to indicate that, he makes his statement only on the authority

mentioned (perhaps all bound in one volume), at sometime in the
ast, but that the title of Arabianus' work had escaped him, and
ence he simply mentioned the work along with the others, without
considering the title a matter of great importance. He speaks of
but a single work, -áAAm ris wrotects, - but Jerome (chap. 51)
mentions guardam of uscula ad christianum dogma fertinentia.
His description is not specific enough to lead us to think that he had
personal knowledge of Arabianus' writings.
It must rather be con
cluded that he allowed himself some license, and that, not satisfied
to speak of a writer without naming his works, and, at the same
time, knowing nothing definite about them, he simply calls them, in
the most general terms, ad christian to m desota Aeromentia, for
if they were Christian works, he was pretty safe in concluding that
they had to do, in some way at least, with Christian doctrine. The
substitution of the plural for the singular (quaedam opuscula for
rts unobeats) can hardly have been an accident.
It is, perhaps,
safe to say, knowing, Jerome's methods, that he permitted himself
to make §: change in order to conceal his own ignorance of the
writings of Arabianus; for to mention a single
k, and say no
more about it than that it had to do with Christian doctrine, would
be a betrayal of entire ignorance in regard to it; but to sum up a
number of writings under the general head ad christianum dogma
Aertimentia, instead of giving all the titles in detail, would be,
of course, quite consistent with an exact acquaintance with all of
them,
if our supposition be correct, we have simply another in
stance of Jerome's common sin, and an instance which, in this case,
reveals a sharp contrast between his character and that of Eusebius,
who never hesitated to confess his ignorance.

7 Eusebius does not imply, in this sentence, that he is not ac
quainted with these works to which he refers. As the words are
commonly translated, we might imagine that he was not familiar
with them, for all the translators make him speak of not being able
to draw any extracts from them for his own history. Thus Valesius:
mec narrationem to slam, ori's most ris interere possu mous, Stroth:
"noch etwas darauserzählen kann "; Closs: "noch etwas daraus
anführen können"; Cruse: "we can neither insert the time nor any
extracts in our History." The Greek of the whole sentence reads,
dow & a to uměeutav Exet w doopumv oux otov Te oute rows Xporous
mapaboovat Ypabi, out" to Topt as a wriumv wroo murīvao Bat, which
seems to mean simply that their works contain no information which
enables him to give §. dates of the authors, or to recount anything
about their lives; that is, they contain no personal allusions. This
is quite different from saying that he was not acquainted with the
works; in fact, had he not been quite familiar with them, he could
not have made such a broad statement. He seems to have searched
them for personal notices, and to have sailed in the search. Whether
these words of Eusebius apply to all the works already mentioned,
or only to the oups ov d'AAww.just referred to, cannot be certainly de
termined. The latter seems most natural; hut even if the reference
be only to those last mentioned, there is every reason to think that
the words are just as true of the writings of Heraclitus, Maximus,
and the others, for he tells us nothing about their lives, nor the time
in which they lived, but introduces them in the most general terms,
as "ancient ecclesiastical men." There seems, therefore, no good rea
son for connecting these writers with the reign of Commodus, rather
than with any other reign of the late scCond or of the third century.

dared to corrupt the Sacred Scriptures.

IN a laborious work by one of these

writers against the heresy

It must be noticed that Eusebius does not say that "these men lived
at this time"; he simply mentions them in this connection because it is
a convenient place, and perhaps because there were indications which
led him to think they could not have lived early in the second or
late in the third century. It is quite possible, as suggested in the pre:
vious note, that the works of the writers whose names are mentioned
in this chapter were collected in a single volume, and that thus
Eusebius was led to class them all together, although the subjects of
their works were by no means the same, and their dates may have
been widely different.

* Eusebius mentioned first those works whose authors' names
were known to him, but now adds that he is acquainted with many
other writings which bear the name of no author. He claims, how
ever, that the works testify to their authors' orthodoxy, and he seems
to imply, by this statement, that he has convinced himself of their
orthodoxy by a personal examination of them.

It is therefore contended b

* This anonymous work against the heresy of Artemon is no
longer extant, and the only fragments of it which we have are those
so by Eusebius in this chapter.
Theodoret (Harr. Faà.
I. 5) mentions the work, and says that it was directed against the
heresies of Theodotus and Artemon, and that it bore the name Little
It is plain, from the fragments which Eusebius gives,
Labyrinth.
that it was written in Rome some little time before the middle
of the third century, probably not far from 230 or 240 A.D. The
work is commonly ascribed to Hippolytus, in favor of which may be
urged both the time and the place of its composition as well as some
internal resemblance between it and the Philosophortena. On the
other hand, Photius (Cod. 48) ascribes to Caius of Rome a work
against Artemon, which may well be identical with the anonymous
work quoted in the present chapter.
It
some (e.g. by Salmon) that Caius was the author of the work.
must be noted, however, that in the same connection Photius as
cribes another work to Caius which we know to have been written
by Hippolytus, and hence his testimony is rather in favor of Hip
polytus than Caius as the author of the work. On the other hand,
several objections have been urged by Salmon against the Hippoly
time authorship, which, while not decisive, yet make it so,
doubtful.
In view of these facts, we must conclude that it is possi
ble, but very improbable, that Hippolytus wrote the work; that it
is not impossible, though we are quite without evidence for the sup
position, that Caius wrote it; that it is more likely that a work which
even to Eusebius was anonymous, was written by an unknown man,
who must remain unknown to us also.
The extant fragments of
the work are given, with notes, by Routh in his We'. Sac., and an
English translation in the Ante-Vicege fathers, Vol. V. p. 601 sq.,
among the works of Caius. Although the work is said by Eusebius
to have been directed against the heresy of Artemon, he has pre
served only extracts, relating to the Theodoti and their heresy.
They are described also by Hippolytus, both in his lost Syntagma
(as we can learn from Pseudo-Tertullian, Epiphanius, and Philas
ter), and in his Poosc// to mena (VII. 23-24, and X. 19). Other
ancient writers that mention him know only what our anonymous
author or Hippolytus reports.
It seems that the older Theodotus,
a native of Byzantium, came to Rome in the time of Eleutherus or
Victor, and taught a species of adoptionism, which reminds us
somewhat of the Asia Minor. Alogi, in whose circle he may have
been trained.
Hippolytus informs us that he was orthodox in his
theology and cosinology, but that he was heretical in his Chris
tology. He did not deny Christ's birth from a virgin (as the Ebio
nites had done), but he did deny his divinity, teaching that he was
a mere man, (or Aos a poptomos), upon whom the Holy Spirit de
scended at the time of his baptism, in consequence of which he
became the Christ, received power to sulfill his special mission, and
by his righteousness was raised above all other men. The descent
o the Holy Spirit, however, although raising him to a very exalted
position, did not make him divine; some ...; Theodotus' followers
denying that he ever acquired divinity, others believing that he ac
quired it by his resurrection. Theodotus was excommunicated by
Victor on account of his heretical Christology, but gained a num

they did not look upon themselves as the followers of the Theodoti
(see below, note 15). We cannot tell, however, in what respect
their Christology differed from that of the latter, for we know very
little about them. They at any rate agreed with the Theodotians in

Antioch (quoted below, in Bk. VII, chap. 30) we learn that Artemon
was still living in the year 268, or thereabouts. He seems, however,

in Irenaeus' utterances on this subject were epoch-making in the
history of doctrine. No one before him had emphasized so encrgeti
cally and brought out so clearly the God-manhood of Christ. His
great significance in Christology is the emphasis which he laid upon
the unity of God and man in Christ, - a unity in which the integrity
both of the divine and of the human was preserved. Our author is
also doubtless correct in saying that Melito called Christ God and
man.
If the two fragments from the Discourse on the Soul and
Body, and from the Discourse on the Cross (printed from the
Syriac by Cureton, in his Spic...Syr. p. 52 sq.), be genuine, as is
quite probable (see above, Bk. IV. chap. 26, note 1), we have clear
indications that Melito taught both the humanity and the deity of
Christ ("when He was become incarnate through the womb of the
Virgin, and was born man." "Inasmuch as He was man, He needed
food; still, inasmuch as He was God, He ceased not to sced the uni
verse").

* This passage is sometimes interpreted as indicating that
hymns written by the Christians themselves were sung in the
church of Rome at this time.
But this is by no means implied.
So far as we are able to gather from our sources, nothing, except
the Psalms and New Testament hymns (such as the "Gloria in
Excelsis," the "Magnificat," the "Nunc Dimittis," &c.), was
as a rule, sung in public worship before the fourth century (the
ractice which had sprung up in the church of Antioch seems to

Before the end of that
century, however, the practice of singing other hymns in the service

the other hand, the private use of hymns among the Christians be

His bishopric lasted ten years, and Zephyrinus was
appointed his successor about the ninth year of
the reign of Severus." The author of the above
mentioned book, concerning the founder of this
heresy, narrates another event which occurred in
the time of Zephyrinus, using these words:
"I will remind many of the brethren of
a fact which took place in our time, which,
had it happened in Sodom, might, I think, have
proved a warning to them. There was a certain
confessor, Natalius," not long ago, but in

as I have said, was the first person excommuni

of this sentiment, or rather senselessness."
Natalius was persuaded by them to allow
himself to be chosen bishop of this heresy
with a salary, to be paid by them, of one
hundred and fifty denarii a month." When
he had thus connected himself with them,
he was warned oftentimes by the Lord through

been impossible to claim that all the Roman bishops, including
Victor, held their opinions. When to this is added the apparent
effort of our author to identify the Artemonites with the Theodo

connection with them, though in what points they differed with them,
we do not know (see above, note 1; and cf. Harnack's Zoossmengesch.

snared by the first position among them and by
that shameful covetousness which destroys a
great many, he was scourged by holy angels,
and punished severely through the entire night."
Thereupon having risen in the morning, he put
on sackcloth and covered himself with ashes,
and with great haste and tears he fell down
before Zephyrinus, the bishop, rolling at the
feet not only of the clergy, but also of the laity;
and he moved with his tears the compassionate
Church of the merciful Christ. And though he
used much supplication, and showed the welts
of the stripes which he had received, yet scarcely
was he taken back into communion."

We will add from the same writer some
other extracts concerning them, which run

as follows : *

"They have treated the Divine Scriptures
recklessly and without fear.
They have set
aside the rule of ancient faith; and Christ they
have not known. They do not endeavor to
learn what the Divine Scriptures declare, but
strive laboriously after any form of syllogism
which may be devised to sustain their impiety.
And if any one brings before them a passage of
Divine Scripture, they see whether a conjunctive
or disjunctive form of syllogism can be
14 made from it. And as being of the earth
and speaking of the earth, and as ignorant
of him who cometh from above, they forsake
the holy writings of God to devote themselves
to geometry."

tus are admired ; and Galen, perhaps, by

* It is not necessary to doubt the truth of this report, if we sub
stitute "muscular Christians" for "holy angels." As Stroth dryly
remarks: "Eben kein lóblich Geschäft für die heiligen Enges;
es werden aber ohne Zweifel Engel mit guten starken Knochen und
Nerven gewesen sein."

* The information which is given us here in regard to the
methods of the Theodotians is very interesting. What is said in
regard to their philosophical principles makes it evident that they
used the grammatical and critical mode of exegesis as opposed to
the prevalent allegorical mode. Nothing could seem more irrever
ent and irreligious to the Church of that age than such a method of
interpretation, the method which we now recognize as the only true
one. They were, moreover, textual critics. They may have been
rash in their methods, but it is not necessary to suppose them dis
honest in their purposes.
They seem to have looked upon the
Scriptures as inspired as truly as their opponents did, but they be.
lieved that radical criticism was needed if the true reading of the
originals was to be reached, while their opponents were shocked at
anything of the kind. That textual criticism was necessary, even
at that early day, is clear enough from the words of Irenaeus (quoted
in chap. 20, above), and from the words of Dionysius (quoted in Bk.
IV. chap. 23), as well as from many other sources.
Finally, these
men seem to have offended their opponents by the use of dialectical

It is indeed the earliest instance known to us of
that method which seemed entirely irreligious to the author of the
Little Labyrinth, but which less than a century later prevailed in
the Antiochian school, and for a large part of the Middle Ages ruled
the whole Church.

matter, whoever wishes may learn.
For if any
one will collect their respective copies, and
compare them one with another, he will
find that they differ greatly. Those of As

those of Theodotus. And many of these can
be obtained, because their disciples have as
siduously written the corrections, as they call
them, that is the corruptions," of each of them.
Again, those of Hermophilus * do not agree

not consistent with themselves.
For you can
compare those prepared by them at an earlier
date with those which they corrupted later,
and you will find them widely different. But
how daring this offense is, it is not likely
that they themselves are ignorant.
For either
they do not believe that the Divine Scriptures
were spoken by the Holy Spirit, and thus are
unbelievers, or else they think themselves wiser
than the Holy Spirit, and in that case what else
are they than demoniacs?
For they cannot
deny the commission of the crime, since the
copies have been written by their own hands.

instructors, nor can they produce any

* These persons can hardly have rejected the Law and the
Prophets utterly, - at least, no hint is given us that they maintained
a fundamental difference between the God of the Old and the God
of the New Testament, as Marcion did, - nor would such wholesale
rejection be natural for critics such as they were.
It is more likely
that they simply, as many of the Gnostics did, emphasized the merely
relative authority of the Old Testament, and that they applied his
torical criticism to it, distinguishing between its various parts in the
matter of authority. Such action is just what we should expect
from members of a critical school like that of Theodotus, and such
criticism in its extremest form would naturally seem to an orthodox
Catholic the same as throwing over the whole book.

1. During the early years of the reign of Septimius Severus the
Christians enjoyed comparative peace, and Severus himself showed
them o: favor.
Early in the third century a change set
in, and in 202 the emperor issued an edict forbidding conversions to
Christianity and to Judaism (Spartianus, in Severo, c. 16; cf. Tille
mont, Hist. des EmA. l II. p. 58). The cause of this radical change
of conduct we do not know, but it is o: that the excesses of the
Montanists produced a reaction in the emperor's mind against the
Christians, or that the rapidity with which Christianity was spread
ing caused him to sear that the old Roman institutions would be
overturned, and hence produced a reaction against it. Why the
!. too, should have been attacked, it is hard to say, -possibly
cause of a new attempt on their part to throw off the Roman yoke
(see Spartianus, in Severo, c. 16); or perhaps there underlay the
whole movement a reaction in the emperor's mind toward the old
Roman paganism (he was always superstitious), and Judaism and
Christianity being looked upon as alike opposed to it, were alike to
be held in check. The edict was aimed, not against those already
Christians, but only against new converts, the idea being to prevent
the further spread of Christianity.
But the change in the emperor's
attitude, thus published abroad, at once intensified all the elements
which were hostile to Christianity; and the popular disfavor, which
continued widespread and was continually venting itself in local per
secutions, now allowed itself freer rein, and the result was that
severe persecutions broke out, which were confined, however, almost
wholly to Egypt and North Africa. Our principal authorities for
these persecutions (which went on intermittently during the rest of
Severus' reign) are the first twelve chapters of this book of Eusebius'
History, and a number of Tertullian's works, especially his De
corona misites, Ad Scajo., and De fuga in 6ersectatione.

* We know very little about Origen's father. The same of the
son overshadowed that of the father, even though the latter was a
martyr. The phrase used in this passage to describe him has caused
some trouble.
Aetovíðms o Aeyóuevos 'Qptyevous n armp. Taken in
its usual sense, the expression means " said to be the father of Ori
gen," or the "so-called father of Origen," both of which appear
strange, for there can have been no doubt as to his identity.
It
seems better, with Westcott, to understand that Eusebius means that
Origen's same had so eclipsed his father's that the latter was distin
uished as "Leonides, the father of Origen," and hence says here,
* Leonides, who was known as the father of Origen." The name
Leonides is Greek, and that he was of Greek nationality is further
confirmed by the words of Porphyry (quoted in chap. 19, below),
who calls Origen "a Greek, and educated in Greek literature." Por
phyry may simply have concluded from his knowledge of Greek let
§. he was a Greek by birth, and hence his statement taken alone
has little weight; but taken in conjunction with Leonides' name, it
makes it probable that the latter was at least of Greek descent;
whether a native of Greece or not we do not know. A late tradition
makes him a bishop, but there is no foundation for such a report.
From the next chapter we learn that Leonides' martyrdom took
place in the tenth year of Severus (201-202 A.D.), which is stated
also by the Chron.

his son was still young. How remarkable the
predilection of this son was for the Divine Word,
in consequence of his father's instruction, it will
not be amiss to state briefly, as his fame has
been very greatly celebrated by many.

* This sixth book of Eusebius' History is our chief source for a
knowledge of Origen's life. His own writings give us little informa
tion of a personal nature; but Eusebius was in a position to learn a
great deal about him. He had the advantage of personal converse
with surviving friends of Origen, as he tells us in this connection;
he had also a large collection of Origen's epistles (he had himself
made a collection of more than one hundred of them, as he tells us
in chap. 36); and he had access besides to official documents, and to
works of Origen's contemporaries which contained references to him
(see chap. 33). As a result, he was in a position to write a full and
accurate account of his life, and in fact, in connection with Pamphi
lus, he did write a Defense of Origen in six books, which contained
both an exposition of his theology with a refutation of charges
brought against him, and a full account of his life. Of this work

much of the greatest interest in connection with Origen's life, espe
cially that period of it about which we are most

residence in Caesarea after his retirement from Alexandria (see chap.
23). In the present book Eusebius gives numerous details of Origen's
life, frequently referring to the Defense for fuller particulars.

more clearly the viciousness of the purely chronological method,

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[VI. 2.

while Laetus * was governor of Alexandria and
the rest of Egypt, and Demetrius" had lately
received the episcopate of the parishes
there, as successor of Julian." As the flame
of persecution had been kindled greatly,"
and multitudes had gained the crown of mar
tyrdom, such desire for martyrdom seized the
soul of Origen, although yet a boy, that he went
close to danger, springing forward and rush
ing to the conflict in his eagerness. And
truly the termination of his life had been
very near had not the divine and heavenly Provi
dence, for the benefit of many, prevented his
desire through the agency of his mother.
For, at first, entreating him, she begged
him to have compassion on her motherly
feelings toward him ; but finding, that when he
had learned that his father had been seized
and imprisoned, he was set the more resolutely,
and completely carried away with his zeal for
martyrdom, she hid all his clothing, and
thus compelled him to remain at home. But,
as there was nothing else that he could do,
and his zeal beyond his age would not suffer him
to be quiet, he sent to his father an encouraging
letter on martydom," in which he exhorted him,
saying, "Take heed not to change your mind
on our account."

This may be recorded as the first evidence of
Origen's youthful wisdom and of his genuine
love for piety.

God, the author of all good, that he had deemed
him worthy to be the father of such a child.

CHAPTER III.

While still very Young, he taught diligently the
Word of Christ.

BUT while he was lecturing in the school,
as he tells us himself, and there was no one
at Alexandria to give instruction in the faith, as
all were driven away by the threat of persecu
tion, some of the heathen came to him to
hear the word of God. The first of them,
he says, was Plutarch,' who after living well,
was honored with divine martyrdom. The sec
ond was Heraclas," a brother of Plutarch ; who
after he too had given with him abundant evi
dence of a philosophic and ascetic life, was
esteemed worthy to succeed Demetrius in the
bishopric of Alexandria.

* * Ti rā Yoakumaruka.
1. Of this Plutarch we know only what Eusebius tells us here,
and in chap. 4, where he says that he was the first of Origen', pupils
to suffer martyrdom.
(On the date of the persecution in which he
suffered, see note 4).

* See below, p. 392.

* Heraclas, brother of Plutarch, proved himself so good a pupil
that, when Origen later found, the work of teaching too great for
him to manage alone, he made him his assistant, and committed the
elementary instruction to him (chap. 15). From chap. 19, we learn
that he was for years a diligent student of Greek o (chap.
15 implies his proficiency in it), and that he even went so far as to
wear the philosopher's cloak all the time, although he was a pres
byter in the Alexandrian church.
His reputation for learning be
came so great, as we learn from chap. 31, that Julius Africanus went
to Alexandria to see him.
In 231, when Origen took his departure
from Alexandria, he left the catechetical school in the charge of
Heraclas (chap. 26), and in 231 or 232, upon the death of Demetrius
(see Bk. V. chap. 22, note 4), Heraclas became the latter's successor
as bishop of Alexandria (chaps. 26 and 29), and was succeeded in
the presidency of the catechetical school by Dionysius (chap. o
According to chap. 35 he was bishop for sixteen years and with this
both versions of the Chron. agree, though Jerome puts his accession
two years too early - into the ninth year of Alexander Severus in
...} of the eleventh - while giving at the same time, quite incon
sistently, the proper date for his death.
Heraclas' later relations to
Origen are not quite clear. He was evidently, in earlier years, one
of his best friends, and there is no adequate ground for the assump
tion, which is quite common, that he was one of those who united
with Bishop Demetrius in condemning him.
It is true, no at
tempt seems to have been made after he became bishop to reverse
the sentence against Origen, and to invite him back to Alexandria;
but this does not prove that Heraclas did not remain friendly to him;
for even when Dionysius (who kept up his relations with Origen,
as we know from chap. 46) became bishop (A.D. 248), no such attempt
seems to have been made, although Origen was still alive and at
the height of his power. The fact that
the greater part of the
clergy of Alexandria and Egypt were unfavorable to Origen, as
shown by their condemnation of him, does not imply that Heraclas
£ould not have been elected unless he too showed hostility to Origen:
for Dionysius, who we know was not hostile, was appointed at that
time head of the catechetical school, and sixteen years later bishop.
It is true that Heraclas may not have sympathized with all of Ori.
gen's views, and may have thought some of them heretical (his strict
judgment of heretics is seen from Bk. VII. chap. 7), but many even
of the best of Origen's friends and followers his likewise, so that
among his most devoted adherents were some of the most orthodox
Fathers of the Church (e.g. the two Gregories and Basil). That
Heraclas did not agree with Origen in all his opinions (if he did not,
he may not have cared to press his return to Alexandria) does not
prove therefore that he took part in the condemnatory action of the
synod, and that he was himself in later life hostile to Origen.

He was in his eighteenth year when he
took charge of the catechetical school."
He was prominent also at this time, during the
persecution under Aquila," the governor of Alex
andria, when his name became celebrated among
the leaders in the faith, through the kindness
and goodwill which he manifested toward all
the holy martyrs, whether known to him or
strangers.
For not only was he with them
while in bonds, and until their final con
demnation, but when the holy martyrs were led
to death, he was very bold and went with them
into danger. So that as he acted bravely, and
with great boldness saluted the martyrs with a
kiss, oftentimes the heathen multitude round
about them became infuriated, and were on
the point of rushing upon him. But through
the helping hand of God, he escaped abso
lutely and marvelously. And this same divine
and heavenly power, again and again, it is im
possible to say how often, on account of his
great zeal and boldness for the words of Christ,
guarded him when thus endangered."
So great
was the enmity of the unbelievers toward him, on
account of the multitude that were instructed by
him in the sacred faith, that they placed bands of
soldiers around the house where he abode.
Thus day by day the persecution burned
against him, so that the whole city could
no longer contain him ; but he removed from
house to house and was driven in every direc
tion because of the multitude who attended upon
the divine instruction which he gave.
For his
life also exhibited right and admirable conduct
according to the practice of genuine philoso
phy. For they say that his manner of life was
as his doctrine, and his doctrine as his life."
Therefore, by the divine Power working with him
he aroused a great many to his own zeal.
But when he saw yet more coming to him
for instruction, and the catechetical school

* See below, p. 392.
* It is not clear from Fusebius' language whether Aquila was
successor of Laetus as viceroy of Egypt (as Redepenning assumes
apparently quite without misgiving), or simply governor of Alexan:
dria. He calls Laetus (in chap. 2) governor of Alexandria and of all
Egypt, while Aquila is called simply governor of Alexandria. If
this difference were insisted on as marking a real distinction, then
Aquila would have to be regarded as the chief officer of Alexandria
àl. and hence subordinate in dignity to the viceroy of Egypt. The
term used to describe his position (ovovue vov) is not, however, the
technical one for the chief officer of Alexandria (see Mommsen,
Provinces of the Roman Em/ore, Scribner's ed., II. p. 267 ff.),
and hence his position cannot be decided with certainty.
In any
case, whether he succeeded Laetus, or was his subordinate, the dates
of his accession to and retirement from office are unknown, and
hence the time at which the persecutions mentioned took place can
not be determined with exactness. We simply know that they
occurred after 203 (for Origen had already taken charge of the
catechetical school, and some of his pupils perished in the persecu
tions) and before 211, the date of Severus' death.

* How it happened that Origen escaped the persecution, when,
according to Eusebius, he exposed himself so continually, and was
so hated by the heathen populace, we cannot tell.
Eusebius ascribes
it solely to the grace of God here, and in chap. 4.

* otos o A6 yos rotos o Bios was a Greek proverb. Compare the
words of Seneca, in Ep. 114 ad Lucion, or, "Apud Graecos in pro.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EU SEBIUS.

[VI. 3.

had been entrusted to him alone by Demetrius,
who presided over the church, he considered the
teaching of grammatical science inconsistent with
training in divine subjects,' and forthwith he gave
up his grammatical school as unprofitable
and a hindrance to 'sacred learning.
Then,
with becoming consideration, that he might
not need aid from others, he disposed of whatever
valuable books of ancient literature he possessed,
being satisfied with receiving from the purchaser
four oboli a day."
For many years he lived
philosophically" in this manner, putting away all
the incentives of youthful desires. Through the
entire day he endured no small amount of dis
cipline; and for the greater part of the night he
gave himself to the study of the Divine Scrip
tures. He restrained himself as much as possi
ble by a most philosophic life; sometimes by
the discipline of fasting, again by limited time for
sleep. And in his zeal he never lay upon a
bed, but upon the ground.
Most of all, he
thought that the words of the Saviour in the
Gospel should be observed, in which he exhorts
not to have two coats nor to use shoes," nor
to occupy oneself with cares for the future."
With a zeal beyond his age he continued in
cold and nakedness; and, going to the very
extreme of poverty, he greatly astonished those
about him. And indeed he grieved many of his
friends who desired to share their possessions
with him, on account of the wearisome toil
which they saw him enduring in the teach
ing of divine things.
But he did not relax
his perseverance. He is said to have walked

7 This does not mean that he considered the study of grammar
and literature injurious to the Christian, or join. to his theo
logical studies. His opinion on that subject is clear enough from all
his writings and from his conduct as pictured in chaps. 18 and 19.
Nor does it on the other hand imply, as Cruse supposes, that up to
this time he had been teaching secular branches erclusively, but
it means simply that the demands upon him for instruction in the
faith were so great, now that the catechetical school had been offi
cially entrusted to him by Demetrius, that he felt that he could no
longer continue to teach secular literature as he had been doing, but
must give up that part of his work, and devote himself exclusively
to instruction in sacred things.

* The obolus was a small Greek coin, equivalent to about three
and a half cents of our money.
Four oboli a day could have been
sufficient, even in that age, only for the barest necessities of life.
But with his ascetic tendencies, these were all that Origen wished.

* It was very common from the fourth century on (the writer
knows of no instances earlier than Eusebius) to call an ascetic mode
of life "philosophical," or "the life of a philosopher" (see § 2 of
this chapter, and compare Chrysostom's works, where the word
occurs very frequently in this sense).
Origen, in his ascetic prac
tices, was quite in accord with the prevailing Christian sentiment of
his own and subsequent centuries, which looked upon bodily disci:
Fo of an ascetic kind, not indeed as required, but as commended
y Christ. The growing sentiment had its roots partly in the pre
vailing ideas of contemporary philosophy, which instinctively em
phasized strongly the dualism ..". and matter, and the necessity
of subduing the latter to the former, and partly in the increasin
moral corruptness of society, which caused |. who wished to lead
holy lives to feel that only by eschewing the things of sense could
the soul attain purity. Under pressure from without and within, it
became very easy to misinterpret various sayings, of Christ, and
thus to find in the Gospels ringing exhortations to a life of the most
rigid asceticism. Clement of Alexandria was almost the only one
of the great Christian writers after the middle of the second century
who distinguished between the true, and the false in this matter.
Compare his admirable tract, Ours dives salvet ur, and contrast the
position taken there with the foolish extreme pursued by Origen, as
recorded in this chapter.

for a number of years never wearing a shoe, and,
for a great many years, to have abstained from
the use of wine, and of all other things beyond his
necessary food; so that he was in danger of break
ing down and destroying his constitution."
By giving such evidences of a philosophic
life to those who saw him, he aroused many
of his pupils to similar zeal; so that prominent
men even of the unbelieving heathen and men
that followed learning and philosophy were led
to his instruction. Some of them having re
ceived from him into the depth of their souls
faith in the Divine Word, became prominent in
the persecution then prevailing; and some of
them were seized and suffered martydom.

mentioned just above." As he was led to

school was Heraclides," and after him the
fourth was Hero."

another Serenus, who, it
is reported, was be

And of women, Herais" died while yet a cate
chumen, receiving baptism by fire, as Origen
himself somewhere says.

12 Greek: 99paš, properly "chest." Rufinus and Christophor
sonus translate stomachum, and Walesius approves; but there
is no authority for such a use of the term 6%pač, so far as I can
ascertain. The proper Greek term for stomach is arguaxos, which
is uniformly employed by Galen and other medical writers.

1 See the previous chapter, § 2. The martyrdom of these disci
ples of Origen took place under Aquila, and hence the date depends
on the date of his rule, which cannot be fixed with exactness, as
remarked in note 4 on the previous chapter.

* These two persons named Serenus, the first of whom was
burned, the second beheaded, are known to us only from this
chapter.

# Of this Heraclides, we know only what is told us in this
chapter. He, with the other martyrs mentioned in this connection,
is commemorated in the mediaeval martyrologies, but our authentic
information is limited to what Eusebius tells us here.

the people of the country for the many things
which she endured for the preservation of her
chastity and virginity.
For she was blooming
in the perfection of her mind and her physical

Having suffered much for the faith of
Christ, finally after tortures dreadful and terri

Not long after this Basilides, being asked
by his fellow-soldiers to swear for a cer
tain reason, declared that it was not lawful for
him to swear at all, for he was a Christian, and
he confessed this openly. At first they thought
that he was jesting, but when he continued to
affirm it, he was led to the judge, and, acknowl
edging his conviction before him, he was im

* Potamiaena, one of the most celebrated of the martyrs that sus.
fered under Severus, is made by Rufinus a disciple of Origen, but
Eusebius does not say that she was, and indeed, in making Basil
ides the seventh of Origen's disciples to suffer, he evidently excludes
Potamiaena from the number. Quite a full account of her martyrdom
is given by Palladius in his Historia Lausiaca, chap. 3 (Migne's
Patr. Gr. XXXIV. Iola), which contains some characteristic de
tails not mentioned by Eusebius.
It appears from that account that
she was a slave, and that her master, not being able to induce her
to yield to his passion, accused her before the judge as a Christian,
bribing him, if possible, to break her resolution by tortures, and
then, return her to him, or, is that was not possible, to put her to
death as a Christian. We cannot judge as to the exact truth of this
and other details related by Palladius, but his history (which was
written early in the fifth century) is, in the main at least, reliable,
except where it deals with miracles and prodigies (cf. the article on
Palladius of Helenopolis, in the Dict. of Christ. Biog.).

* Basilides is clearly reckoned here among the disciples of Ori
gen. The correctness of Eusebius' statement has been doubted, but
there is no ground for such doubt, for there is no reason to suppose
that all of Origen's pupils became converted under his instruction.

But the brethren in God coming to him and inquiring the reason of this
sudden and remarkable resolution, he is reported
to have said that Potamiaena, for three days after
her martyrdom, stood beside him by night and
placed a crown on his head, and said that she

In the first

* The word gibpayis, "seal," was very commonly used by the

Fathers to signify baptism (see Suicer's Thesaurus).

* This chapter has no connection with the preceding, and its
insertion at this point has no good ground, for Clement has been
already handled in the fifth book; and if Eusebius wished to reser to
him again in connection with Origen, he should have done so in
chap., 3, where Origen's appointment as head of the catechetical
school is mentioned. o however, approves the present
order; vol. I. p. 431 sqq.)
Rufinus felt the inconsistency, and hence
inserted chaps, 6 and 7 in the middle of chap. 3, where the account of
Walesius considers
Origen's appointment by Demetrius is given.
the occurrence of this mention of Clement at this point a sign that
Eusebius did not give his work a final revision. Chap. 13 is inserted
in the same abrupt way, quite out of harmony with the context.
Upon the life of Clement of Alexandria, see Bk. V. chap. 11, note 1.
The catechetical school was vacant, as we learn from chap. 2, in the
year 203, and was then taken in charge by Origen, so that the "that
time" referred to by Eusebius in this sentence must be carried back
of the events related in the previous chapters. The cause of Clement's
leaving the school was probably the persecution begun by Severus
in 202 ("all were driven away by the threatening aspect of persecu
tion," to; to chap. 3 i 1); for since Origen was one of his
pupils he can hardly have ief song before that time." That it was
not unworthy cowardice which led Clement to take his departure is
clear enough from the words of Alexander in chaps. 11 and 14, from
the high reputation which he continued to enjoy throughout the
Church, and from his own utterances on the subject of martyrdom
scattered through his works.

2 On P
* Stephanus, Stroth, Burton, Schwegler, Laemmer, and Heini

omit the words maiča ovira "while a boy."
But the words are found
in all the other codices (the chief witnesses of two of the three great
families of MSS. being for them) and in Nicephorus. The manuscript
authority is therefore overwhelmingly in favor of the words, and
they are adopted by Valesius, Zimmermann, and Cruse. Rufinus
is a strong witness against the words, but, as, Redepenning justly
remarks, having inserted this chapter, as he did; in the midst of the
description of Origen's early years (see note 1), the words Taoa oro
would be quite superfluous and even out of place, and hence he would
naturally omit them. So far as the probabilities of the insertion
or omission of the words in the present, passage are concerned, it
seems to me more natural to suppose that a copyist, finding, the
words at this late stage in the account of Origen's life, would be
inclined to omit them, than that, not finding them there he should,
upon historical grounds (which he could have reached only aster
some reflection), think that they ought to be inserted. The latter
would be not only a more i. but also a much graver step than
the former.
There seems, then, to be no good warrant for omit:
ting these words. We learn from chap. 3 that he took charge of
the catechetical school when he was in his eighteenth year, within
a year therefore after the death of his father, And we learn that

So it is evident that that work was written dur

The Isriter, Judas."

At this time another writer, Judas, discoursing
about the seventy weeks in Daniel, brings down
the chronology to the tenth year of the reign of
Severus. He thought that the coming of Anti
christ, which was much talked about, was then
near." So greatly did the agitation caused by
the persecution of our people at this time dis
turb the minds of many.

CHAPTER VIII.

Origen's Daring Deed.

l

At this time while Origen was conduct
ing catechetical instruction at Alexandria, a
deed was done by him which evidenced an
immature and youthful mind, but at the same
time gave the highest proof of faith and conti

before he took charge of the school, all who had given instruction
there had been driven away by the persecution. Clement, therefore,
must have left before Origen's eighteenth year, and hence the latter
must have studied with him, before the persecution had broken up
the school, and in all probability before the death of Leonides.
In
any case, therefore, he was still a boy when under Clement, and
even if we omit the words -"while a boy "-here, we shall not be
warranted in putting his student days into the period of his maturity,
as some would do. Upon this subject, see Redepenning, I. p. 431 sqq.,
who adduces still other arguments for the position taken in this note
which it is not necessary to repeat here.

* In Stromtata, Bk. I. chap. 21. On this and the other works of

Clement, see chap. 13.

1 The mention of the writer Judas at this point seems, at first
sight, as illogical as the reference to Clement in the preceding chap
But it does not violate chronology as that is. and hence, if
ter.
the account of Origen's life was to be broken anywhere for such an
insertion, there was perhaps no better place. We cannot conclude,
therefore, that Eusebius, had he revised his work, would have
changed the position of this chapter, as Walesius suggests (see the
previous chapter, note 1).

Jerome (de vir. isł. c. 52) repeats Eusebius' notice of Judas, but
adds nothing to it, and we know no more about him. Since he
believed that the appearance of Antichrist was at hand, he must
have written before the persecutions had given place again to peace,
and hence not long after 202, the date to which he extended his

chronology.
commentary or a work on chronology is not clear.
It was possibly
an historical demonstration of the truth of Daniel's prophecies, and
an interpretation of those yet unfulfilled, in which case it combined
history and exegesis.
: F. was the common belies in the Church, from the time of the
apostles until the time of Constantine, that the second coming of
Christ would very speedily take place. This belief was especially
pronounced among the Montanists, Montanus having proclaimed
that the Aarousia would occur bestore his death, and even having
gone so far as to attempt to collect all the faithful (Montanists) in
one place in Phrygia, where they were to await that event and where
the new Jerusalem was to be set up (see above, Bk. V. chap. 18,
note 6).
There is nothing surprising in Judas' idea that this severe
persecution must be the beginning of the end, for all through the
earlier centuries of the Church (and even to some extent in later
centuries) there were never wanting those who interpreted similar
catastrophes in the same way; although after the third century the
belief that the end was at hand grew constantly weaker.

nence."
For he took the words, "There
are eunuchs who have made themselves
eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake," " in
too literal and extreme a sense. And in order
to fulfill the Saviour's word, and at the same
time to take away from the unbelievers all oppor
tunity for scandal, -for, although young, he met
for the study of divine things with women as
well as men, − he carried out in action the
word of the Saviour.
He thought that this
would not be known by many of his acquaint
ances.
But it was impossible for him, though de
siring to do so, to keep such an action secret.
When Demetrius, who presided over that
parish, at last learned of this, he admired
greatly the daring nature of the act, and as he
perceived his zeal and the genuineness of his
faith, he immediately exhorted him to courage,
and urged him the more to continue his work
of catechetical instruction. Such was he at
that time.
But soon afterward, seeing that
he was prospering, and becoming great and dis
tinguished among all men, the same Demetrius,
overcome by human weakness, wrote of his deed

* This act of Origen's has been greatly discussed, and some have
even gone so far as to believe that he never committed the act, but
that the report of it arose from a misunderstanding of certain figura
tive expressions used by him (so, e.g., Boehringer, Schnitzer, and
There is no reason, however, to doubt the report, for which

we have unimpeachable testimony, and which is in itself not at all
surprising (see the arguments of Redepenning, I. p. 444 sqq.). The
act, was contrary to the civil law (see Suetonius, Domitian, c. 7;
and cf. Justin 'i. r, Apol. I. 29), and yet was a very common
one; the existence *. law itself would alone prove what we know
from many sources to have been the fact. Nor was Origen alone
among the Christians (cf. e.g., Origen, In Matt., XV. 1, the passage
of Justin Martyr referred to above, and also the first canon of j
Council of Nicaea, the very existence of which proves the necessity
of it). It was natural that Christians, seeking purity of life, and
strongly ascetic in their tendencies, should be influenced by the
actions of those about them, who sought thus to be freed from the
domination of the passions, and should interpret certain passages of
the Bible as commending the act.
Knowing it to be so common,
and knowing. Origen's character, as revealed to us in chap. 3, above
(to say nothing of his own writings), we can hardly be surprised

same as that which actuated him in all his ascetic practices, the
attainment of higher holiness through the o of his pas
sions, and the desire to sacrifice everything fleshly for the sake of
Christ. Of course this could not have led him to perform the act
he did, unless he had entirely misunderstood, as Eusebius says he
did, the words of Christ quoted below.
But he was by no means
the only one to misunderstand them (see Suicer's, Thesaurus, I.
1255 sq.). Eusebius says that the requirements of his position also
had something to do with his resolve. He was obliged to teach both
men and women, and both day and night (as we learn from $ 7),
and Eusebius thinks he would naturily desire to avoid candal.
At the same time, this motive can hardly have weighed very heavily,
if at all, with him; for had his giving instruction in this way been in
danger of causing serious "... other easier methods of avoiding
such scandal might have been devised, and undoubtedly would have
been, by the bishop. And the fact is, he seems to have wished to
conceal the act, which is inconsistent with the idea that he per
formed it for the sake of avoiding scandal.
It is quite likely that
his intimate association with women may have had considerable to
do with his resolve, because he may have found that such associa
tion aroused his unsubdued passions, and therefore felt that they
must be eradicated, if he was to go about his duties with a pure and
single heart.
That he afterward repented his youthful act, and
judged the words of Christ more wisely, is clear from what he says
in his Comment. in J/aft. XV. 1. And yet he never outgrew his
false notions of the superior virtue of an ascetic life.
is act seems
to have caused a reaction in his mind which led him into doubt and
despondency for a time; for Demetrius found it necessary to exhort
him to cherish confidence, and to urge him to continue his work
of instruction.
Eusebius, while not approving Origen's, act, yet
evidently admired him the more for the boldness and for the spirit
of self-sacrifice shown in its performance.

as most foolish to the bishops throughout the

* Septimius Severus died on February 4, 211, after a reign of a
little more than seventeen years and eight months, and was suc
ceeded by his two sons, Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Bassi
anus (commonly known by his nickname Caracalla, which, however,
was never used in official documents or inscriptions), and Lucius,
or Publius, Septimius Geta.
Eusebius mentions here only the for
mer, giving him his official name, Antoninus.

Eusebius makes a slip here, as this is the first time he has men
tioned Alexander in his Church History. He was very likely un
der the impression that he had mentioned him just above, where he
referred to the bishops of Caesarea and Jerusalem. . He does refer to
him in his Chron., putting his appointment as assistant bishop into
the second year of Caracalla (Armen. sourth year), and calling him
the thirty-fifth bishop of Jerusalem (Armen. thirty-sixth).
In Bk.
V. chap. 12 of the History (also in the Chron.) we are told that
Narcissus was the thirtieth bishop of Jerusalem. The number thirty
five for Alexander (the number thirty-six of the Armen. is a mistake,
and is set right in connection with Alexander's successor, who is also
called the thirty-sixth) is made out by counting the three bishops
mentioned in chap. 10, and then reckoning the second episcopate of
Narcissus (see the same chapter) as the thirty-fourth. We learn
from chap. 14 that Alexander was an early friend of Origen's, and a
fellow-pupil in the school of Clement. We know him next as bishop
of some church in Cappadocia (chap. 11; see note 2 on that chap
ter), whence he was ... to be assistant bishop of Jerusalem (see
the same chapter). From this passage, compared with chap. 11;
we learn that Alexander was imprisoned during the persecutions, and
the Chron. gives the year of his "confession" as 203 A.D. But from
chap. It we learn that he wrote while still in prison to the church of
Antioch on occasion of the appointment of Asclepiades to the episco
F. there. According to the Chron. Asclepiades did not become
ishop until 211; and though this may not be the exact date, yet it
cannot be far out of the way (see chap. 11, note 6); and hence, if
Alexander was a confessor in 203, he must have remained in prison
a number of years, or else have undergone a second persecution.
It
is probable either that the date 203 is quite wrong, or else that he
suffered a second time toward the ão. of Severus' reign; for the per
secution, so far as we know, was not so continuous during that reign
as to keep one man confined for eight years. Our knowledge of the
persecutions in Asia Minor at this time is very limited, but they do
not seem to have been of great severity or of long duration. The
date of Alexander's episcopate in Cappadocia it is impossible to de
termine, though as he was a fellow-pupil of Origen's in Alexandria,
it cannot have begun much, if any, before 202. The date of his
translation to the see of Jerusalem is likewise uncertain. The
Chron. gives the second year of Caracalla (Armen. fourth). The
connection in which É. mentions it in chap. 11 makes it look
as if it took place before Asclepiades' accession to the see of Anti
och; but this is hardly possible, for it was his firmness under perse

of the church in Jerusalem. On account of his
pre-eminence in the confession of Christ he was
thought worthy of that bishopric, while Narcis
sus,' his predecessor, was still living.

CHAPTER IX.

The Miracles of Marcissus,

l

THE citizens of that parish mention many
other miracles of Narcissus, on the tradi
tion of the brethren who succeeded him ; among
which they relate the following wonder as
performed by him. They say that the oil
once failed while the deacons were watching
through the night at the great paschal vigil.
Thereupon the whole multitude being dismayed,
Narcissus directed those who attended to the
lights, to draw water and bring it to him.
This being immediately done he prayed
over the water, and with firm faith in the
Lord, commanded them to pour it into the
lamps. And when they had done so, contrary to
all expectation by a wonderful and divine power,
the nature of the water was changed into that of
oil. A small portion of it has been preserved
even to our day by many of the brethren there
as a memento of the wonder."

They tell many other things worthy to be
noted of the life of this man, among which
is this.
Certain base men being unable to en
dure the strength and firmness of his life, and
fearing punishment for the many evil deeds of
which they were conscious, sought by plotting
to anticipate him, and circulated a terrible
slander against him.
And to persuade
those who heard of it, they confirmed their
accusations with oaths: one invoked upon him
self destruction by fire; another the wasting of
his body by a foul disease; the third the loss of

cution which elevated him to the see of Jerusalem (according to this
passage), and it is apparently that persecution which he is enduring
when Asclepiades becomes %. We find no reason, then, for
erusalem given by the
correcting the date of his translation to
Chron. At any rate, he was bishop of Jerusalem when Origen
visited Palestine in 216 (see chap. 19, § 17).
In 231 he assisted at
the ordination of Origen o chap. 23, note 6), and finally, per
ished in prison during the Decian perscution (see chaps. 39 and 46).
His friendship for Origen was warm and steadfast (cf., i. the
other passages referred to, chap. 27). The latter commemorates the
loveliness and gentleness of si. character in his first Homily on
1 Samuel, § 1. He collected a valuable library in Jerusalem, which
Eusebius made use of in the composition of his History (see chap.
20).
This act shows the literary tastes of the man. Of his epistles
only the five fragments preserved by Eusebius (chaps. 11, 14, and
19) are now extant. Jerome (de oir ill. 62) says that other epistles
were extant in his day; and he relates, on the authority of an epistle
written aro Origene contra Demetrium, that Alexander had or
dained Örigen forta testimonium Demetri. . This epistle is not
mentioned by Eusebius, but in spite of Jerome's usual dependence
upon the latter, there is no good reason to doubt the truth of his
statement in this case (see below, p. 396).

A/exander.

BUT as on account of his great age Narcissus was no longer able to perform his
official duties," the Providence of God called to
the office with him, by a revelation given him
in a night vision, the above-mentioned Alexan
der, who was then bishop of another parish."

1 The extreme age of Narcissus at this time is evident from the
fact that Alexander, writing before the year 216 (see note 4), says
The translation of
that Narcissus is already in his 116th year.
Alexander ...]." must have taken place about 212 (see chap.
8, note 6), and hence, Narcissus was now more than 11o years old.
The appointment of Alexander as Narcissus' assistant involved two
acts which were even at that time not common, and which were later
forbidden by canon; first the translation of a bishop from one see
to another, and secondly the appointment of an assistant bishop,
which made two bishops in one city. The Apost. Canons (No. 14)
ordain that "a bishop ought not to leave his own parish and leap to
another, although the multitude should compel him, unless there be
some good reason forcing him to do this, as that he can contribute
much greater profit to the people of the new parish by the word of
piety; but this is not to be settled by himself, but by the judgmen:
of many bishops and very great supplication." . It has been disputed
whether this canon is osder or younger than the fifteenth canon of
Nicaea, which forbids unconditionally the practice of translation from
one see to another.
Whichever may be the older, it is certain
that even the Council of Nicaea considered its own canon as liable to
exceptions in certain cases, for it translated Eustathius from Beraea
to Antioch (see Sozomen, H. E. I. 2). The truth is, the rule was
established-whether before or for the first time at the Council of
Nicaea - chiefly in order to guard against the ambition of aspirin
men who might wish to go from a smaller to a greater parish, .#
to prevent, as the Nicene Canon, says, the many disorders and
quarrels which the custom of translation caused; and a rule formed
on such grounds of expediency was of course liable to exception
whenever the good of the Church seemed to demand it, and therefore,
whether the fourteenth Apostolic Canon is more ancient than the
Nicene Council or not, it certainly embodies a principle which must
long have been in force, and which we find in fact acted upon in the
present case; for the translation of Alexander takes place "with the
common consent of the bishops of the neighboring churches," or, as
Jerome puts it, cunctis in Palestina episco/is in unum congre
gatos, wo is quite in accord with the provision of the Apostolic
Canons. There were some in the early Church who thought it abso
lutely unlawful under any circumstances for a bishop to be trans

was not the common view, as Bingham (Antiq.
observes, and instances of translation from one see to another were
during all these centuries common (cf. e.g. Socrates, H. E. VII. 36),
although always of course exceptional, and considered lawful onl
when made for good and sufficient reasons. To say, therefore, wit
Valesius that these Palestinian bishops violated a rule of the Church
in translating Alexander is too strong. They were evidently uncon
scious of anything uncanonical, or even irregular in their action,
though it is clear that they regarded the step as too important to be
taken without the approval .# all the bishops of the neighborhood.
In regard to assistant bishops, Walesius correctly remarks that this is
the first instance of the kind known to us, but it is by no means the
only one, for the following centuries furnish numerous examples:
e.g. Theotecnus and Anatolius in Caesarea (see below, Bk. VII.
chap. 32), Maximus and Macarius in Jerusalem (see Sozomen, H. A.
II. 20); and so in Africa Valerius of Hippo had Augustine as his
coadjutor (Possidius, I ita. A ug. chap. 8; see Bingham's Antiy. II.
13. 4 for other instances and for a discussion of the whole subject).
The principle was in force from as early as the third century (see
Cyprian to Cornelius, EA, 40, al. 44 and to Antonianus, A.A. 51,
.. 55) that there should be only one bishop in a city, , and we
see from the works of various #. that this rule was universally
accepted at an early date. The eighth canon of Nicaea refers to this
principle in passing as if it were already firmly established, and the
council evidently did not think it necessary to promulgate a special

although his scruples were overcome at the time, he afterward, upon
learning of the Nicene Canon, considered the practice of having a
coadjutor illegal and refused to ordain one for |. But, as the
instances referred to above and many others show, not all the Church
interpreted the principle as rigidly as Augustine did, and, hence
under certain circumstances exceptions were made to the rule, and
were looked upon throughout the Church as quite lawful. The
existence of two bishops in one city as a matter of compromise, for
the sake of healing a schism, formed one common exception to the
general principle (see Bingham, II. 13. 2), and the appointment of
coadjutors, as in the present case, formed another.

ALEXANDER, BISHOP OF JERUSALEM.

Thereupon, as by Divine direction, he jour
neyed from the land of Cappadocia, where
he first held the episcopate, to Jerusalem, in
consequence of a vow and for the sake of infor
mation in regard to its places." They received
him there with great cordiality, and would not
permit him to return, because of another reve
lation seen by them at night, which uttered the
clearest message to the most zealous among
them.
For it made known that if they would
go outside the gates, they would receive the
bishop foreordained for them by God. And
having done this, with the unanimous consent
of the bishops of the neighboring churches,
they constrained him to remain.
Alexan
der, himself, in private letters to the Anti
noites," which are still preserved among us,
mentions the joint episcopate of Narcissus and
himself, writing in these words at the end of the

epistle :

"Narcissus salutes you, who held the epis
copate here before me, and is now associated
with me in prayers, being one hundred and sixteen
years of age ; and he exhorts you, as I do, to be
of one mind."

These things took place in this manner.

But,
on the death of Serapion," Asclepiades," who had
(note on this o and Tillemont (//ist. eccles. III. p. 415)
give Flaviopolis or Flaviadis as the name of the city (upon the
authority of Basilicon, Jor. Graeco-Rom. Tom. I. p. 295, accord
ing to Tillemont).
But Flaviopolis was a city of Cilicia, and hence
Tillemont conjectures that it had once been taken from Cappadocia

believes that this notice rests upon better knowledge than the notices

But Harnack contends that the date is not quite correct, because
Alexander, who suffered under Severus, was still in prison when
Asclepiades became bishop, and therefore the latter's accession
must be put back into Severus' reign. He would fix, therefore,
upon about 299 as the date of it, rightly perceiving that there is
good reason for thinking the Chron. at least nearly correct in its
report, and that in any case his accession cannot be carried back
much beyond that, because it is quite probable (from the congratu
lations which Alexander extends to the church of Antioch) that
there had been a vacancy in that church for some time after the death
of Serapion (a thing not at all unnatural in the midst of the perse

It is probable that others have preserved
other memorials of Serapion's literary in

dressed to a certain Domninus, who, in the time
of persecution, fell away from faith in Christ to
the Jewish will-worship;" and those addressed

into the time of Caracalla, and hence it is quite possible that Ascle
piades did not become bishop until after the latter became emperor,
so that it is not necessary to correct the date of the Chron.

is impossible to determine with certainty the length of Asclepia

It is
suggested by Daniell (in the Dict. of Christ. Biog. IV. 630) that
this shows that the prohibition uttered by Severus against #: Jews
"must have been soon relaxed, if it ever was enforced."
But in re
gard to this it must be said, in the first place, that Severus' decree
was not levelled against the Jews, but only against conversion to
Judaism, - against the fieri, not the esse, }..." The object of
the edict was not to disturb the Jews in the exercise of their national

into Judaism on account of the persecution, it seems highly probable
that he was simply a converted Jew, who gave up now, in order to
avoid persecution, his new faith, and again practised the religion of
his fathers.
Nothing, therefore, can be concluded from Donninus'
case as to the strictness with which Severus' law was carried out,
even if we suppose Domninus to have fallen from Christianity into
lo. But it must be remarked, in the second place, that it is
y no means certain that Eusebius means to say that Domninus fell
into Judaism, or became a Jew. He is said to have fallen into
"Jewish will-worship" (ex Terroxora ori Inv 'lovčak no

greav). The word beaotopmorseta occurs for the first time in Col.
ii. 23, and means there an "arbitrary, self-imposed worship" (Elli
cott), or a worship which one " affects" (Cremer). The word is
used there in connection with the Oriental theosophic and Juda
istic errors which were creeping into the churches of Asia Minor at
the time the epistle was written, and it is quite possible that the
word may be used in the present case in reference to the same class
of errors. We know that these theosophizing and Judaizing tenden

reject intelligently the writings falsely ascribed

down to us. When I visited you I supposed
that all of you held the true faith, and as I

But you will learn,
brethren, from what has been written to you,
that we perceived the nature of the heresy
of Marcianus,' and that, not understanding
what he was saying, he contradicted himself.

who had studied it diligently, namely, from
the successors of those who first used it, whom

Syria during the early centuries, and that the Ebionitos and the El
césaites were not the only ones affected by them (see Harnack, Pog

a Judaizing Gnosticism, or similar form of heresy-a o: which
cannot have been at all uncommon among the fanatical Phrygians
and other peoples of that section - might well be called a lapse into
"Jewish will-worship." We do not know where Domninus, lived,
but it is not improbable that Asia Minor was his home, and that he
may have fallen under the influence of Montanism as well as of Ebi
onism and Judaizing Gnosticism. . I suggest the possibility that his
lapse was into heresy rather than into Judaism pure and simple, for
the reason that it is easier, on that ground, to explain the fact that
Serapion addressed a work to him. . He is known to us only as an
opponent of heresy, and it may be that Domninus' lapse gave him
an opportunity to attack the heretical notions of these Ebionites, or
other Judaizing heretics, as he had attacked the Montanists. . It
seems to the writer, also, that it is thus easier to explain the complex
phrase used, which seems to imply something different from Juda
ism pure and simple.

Finally, the impression left by this passage is that "Mar

So much in regard to Serapion.

CHAPTER XIII.

The IWritings of Clement."

ALL the eight Stromata of Clement are
preserved among us, and have been given by

§okéw, "to seem or appear." The belief is as old as the first cen
tury (cf. 1 John iv. 2; 2. John 7), and was a favorite one with most
of the Gnostic sects. The name 100cetae, however, as a general ap
pellation for all those holding this opinion, seems to have been used
first by Theodoret (Ep. 82).
But the term was employed to desig
nate a particular sect before the end of the second century; thus
Clement of Alexandria speaks of them in Strøm. VII. 17, and Hip
polytus (Phil. VIII. 8.4, and X. 12; Ante-Mirene, Fathers, Amer.
: and it is evidently this particular sect to which Serapion refers
here. An examination of Hippolytus' account shows that these
Docetae did not hold what we § 3. i. ideas of Christ's body; in
fact, Hippolytus saysox. they taught that Christ was born,
and had a true body from the Virgin (see Phil. VIII.3). How the
sect came to adopt the name of Docetae we cannot tell. They seem
to have disappeared entirely before the fourth century, for no mention
of them is found in Epiphanius and other later heresiologists. As was
remarked above, Theodoret uses the term in a general sensc and not
as the appellation of a particular sect, and this became the common
usage, and is still. wi. there was anything in the teaching of
the sect to suggest the belief that Christ had ...; an apparent body,
and thus to lead to the use of their specific name for all who .#
that view, or whether the general use of the name Docetar arose
quite independently of the sect name, we do not know. . The latter
seems more probable. The Docetae referred to by Hippolytus being
a purely Gnostic sect with a belief in the reality of Christ's body,
we have no reason to conclude that the "Gospel of Peter" contained
what we call Docetic teaching. The description which Serapion
gives of the gospel fits quite well a work containing some such
Gnostic speculations as Hippolytus describes, and thus adding to the
Gospel narrative rather than 3. the truth of it in any part.
He could hardly have spoken as he did of a work which denied the
reality of Christ's body.
See, on the general subject, Salmon's arti
cles /?ocetae and /)acetism in the 19tct. of Christ. Biog.

* The interpretation of these last two clauses is beset with difficulty.
The Greek reads touréart mapá ràov Švačáxtov row katapčan ovov

vov to Ti
airoi are usually translated
who preseded him," or "who led the
way before him "; but the phrase hardly seems to admit of this in
terpretation, and moreover the airou seems to refer not to Marci
anus, whose name occurs some lines back, but to the gospel which
has just been mentioned.
There is a difficulty also in regard to the
reference of the exei vov, which is commonly connected with the
words tos 318dorkaAtas, but which seems to belong rather with the
oppov muara and to refer to the 6taëoxor row ... It thus
seems necessary to define the rms & Saorka Ai as more closely, and we
therefore venture, with Closs, to insert the words "of that school,"
referring to the Pocco.e just mentioned.

Eusebius names ten works in à. chapter.

* On the life of Clement, see Bk. V. chap. 11, note 1. He was a
very prolific writer, as we can gather from the list of works men
tioned in this chapter. The list is repeated by Jerome (de vior. Fol.
c. 38) and by Photius (Cod. Io9-111), the former of whom merely
copies from Eusebius, with some mistakes, while the latter copies
from Jerome, as is clear from the similar variations in the titles given
by the last two from those given by Eusebius, and also by the
omission in both their lists .# one work mai.hed by Eusebius (see
below, note 10).
In
addition to these there are extant two quotations from a work of
Clement entitled nepi mpovoias. There are also extant two frag
ments of a work step. Luxois.
In the Instructor, Bk. II. chap. Io,
Clement refers to a work On Continence (o nepi oykpateias) as al
ready written by himself, and there is no reason to doubt that this
was a separate work, for the third book of the Stromata (to which
Fabricius thinks he refers), which treats of the same subject, was
not yet written. The work is no longer extant.
In the Instructor,
Bk. I II. chap. 8, Clement speaks of a work which he had written On
A for rriage (o yau i kos Aóyos).
It has been thought possible that he
may have referred here to his discussion of the same subject in Bk.
II. chap. 10 of the same work (see the Bishop of Lincoln's work on
Clement, p. 7), but it seems more probable that he referred to a sep

In addition to these works, referred to as already written, Clem
ent promises to write on First Principles (nept apxtov; Strom.
III.3, IV. 1, 13, V. 14, et al.) : on Prophecy (Strom. I. 24, IV. 13,
V. 13); on Angel's (Strom. VI. 13); on the Origin of the Hoor/of
(Stron. VI. joi...", a part of the proposed work on First
Principles, and perhaps to be identified with the commentary on
Genesis, referred to below by Eusebius (see note 28), - Against
Herestes (Strom. IV. 13), on the Resurrection (/nstructor, I. 6,
II. 10).
It is quite possible that Clement regarded his promises as
fulfilled by the discussions which he gives, in various parts of the
Stromata themselves, or that he gave up his original purpose.

* Clement's three

principal works, the A. rhortation to the
Greeks (see below, note 5), the Instructor (note 6), and the Stro
mata, form a connected series of works, related to one another (as
Schaff says) very much as apologetics, ethics, and dogmatics. The
three works were composed in the order named. The Stromtata
Srpou are is) or Miscellanies (said by Eusebius in this passage to
bear the title row Karā Tov d'Anton biàoorooblaw Yvoo Tukov wrouwm
uarev otpouares) are said by Eusebius and by Photius (Cod. Io9)
to consist of eight books.
Only seven are now extant, although
there exists a fragment purporting to be a part of the eighth book,
but which is in reality a portion of a treatise on logic, . in the
time of Photius some reckoned the tract Qui's dives sa/veter as the
eighth book (Photius, Cod. 111). There thus exists no uniform tra
dition as to the character of the lost book, and the suggestion of
Westcott seems plausible, that at an early date the logical introduc
tion to the Psygotyposes was separated from the remainder of the
work, and added to some MSS. of the Stromata as an eighth book.
If this be true, the Stromata consisted originally of only seven books,
and hence we now have the whole work (with the exception of a
fragment lost at the beginning). The name Srpouareis, "patch
work," sufficiently indicates the character of the work.
It is with
out methodical arrangement, containing a heterogeneous mixture of
science, philosophy, poetry, and theology, and yet is animated b
one idea throughout, - that Christianity satisfies the highest intel
lectual desires of man,- and hence the work is intended in some sense
as a guide to the deeper knowledge of Christianity, the knowledge

mingled with worthless crudities, and, like nearly all of Clement's
works, abounds in wide and varied learning, not always fully di
gested. The date at which the work was composed may be gath
ered from a passage in Bk. I. chap. 21, where a list of the Roman
emperors is closed with a mention of Commodus, the exact length
of whose reign is given, showing that he was already dead, but also
showing apparently that his successor was still living.
This would
lead us to put the composition at least of the first book in the first
It might of course be said that Pertinax
quarter of the year 193.
and Didius Julianus are omitted in this list because of the brevity
of their reigns, and this is possible, since in his own list he gives the
reigns of the emperors simply by years, omitting Otho and Vitellius.
The other list which he quotes, however, gives every emperor, with
the number of years, months, and even days of each reign, so that
there is no reason, at least in that list, for the omission of Pertinax
and Didius Julianus.
It seems probable that, under the influence
of that exact list, and of the recentness of the reigns of the two
emperors named, Clement can hardly have omitted them if they had
already ruled. we can say with absolute certainty, however, only
that the work was written after 192. Clement . Alexandria in
202, or before, and this, as well as the rest of his works, was written
in all probability before that time at the latest.

The standard edition of Clement's works is that of Potter, Oxford,
1715, in two vols. (reprinted in Migne's Patr. Gr., Vols. VIII. and
#. Complete English translation in the Ante-Mireme Fathers,
Amer. ed., Vol. II. §. his writings, see especially Westcott's article
in the Dict. of Christ. Biog. and for the literature on the subject,
Schaff's Ch. Hist. II. 781.

* The Hypotyposes (virorvmages), or Outlines (Eusebius calls
them ot on tyeypauple vot wrotumaa e ov aurou Aoyot), are no longer
extant, though fragments have been preserved. The work (which
was in eight books, o, to this passage) is referred to by
Eusebius, in Bk. I. chap. 12 (the fifth book), in Bk. II. chap. 1 (the
sixth and seventh books), in Bk. II, chaps, 9 and 23 (the seventh
book), chap. 15 (the sixth book), in Bk. V. chap. 11, and in Bk. VI.
chap. 14 (the book not specified). Most of these extracts are of a
historical character, but have to do (most of them, not all) with the
apostolic age, or the New Testament. We are told in chap. 14 that
the work contained abridged accounts of all the Scriptures, but
sis, Exodus, ào, Ecclesiastes, the epistles of #. and the
Photius (Cod. 109) says that it seems to have dealt only with Gene
Catholic epistles (o & oaos oxomos waavet épunveia, rvyxovovo. Tils
I'eyed ecos x.T.A.).
Besides the detached quotations there are extant
three series of extracts which are supposed to have been taken from
the Hypotyposes.
These are The Summaries from Theodotus,
The Prophetic Selections, and the Out/ines on the Catholic Apis
tles. On these fragments, which are very corrupt and desultory, see
Westcott in the Dict. of Christ. Biog. They discuss all sorts of
doctrines, and contain the interpretations of the most various
schools, and it is not always clearly stated whether Clement himself

Photius condemns parts of
the 1/yootyposes severely, but it seems, from these extracts which we
have, that he may have read the work, full as it was of the heretical
opinions of other men and schools, without distinguishing Clement's
own opinions from those of others, and that thus he may carelessly
have attributed to him all the wild notions which he mentions.
These extracts as well as the various references of Eusebius show
that the work, like most of the others which Clement wrote, covered
a great deal of ground, and included discussions of a great man
collateral subjects.
It does not seem, in fact, to have been muc
more systematic than the Instructor or even the Stromata.
It
seems to have been intended as a part of the great series, of which
the E-rhortation, /nstructor, * Stromata were the first three.
If so, it followed them. We have no means of ascertaining its date

is still extant in its entirety.
It is called by Jerome (de vir. 1/2.

it was addressed not to the Gentiles in general, but to the Greeks, as
its title and its contents alike indicate. The general aim of the book
is to "prove the superiority of Christianity to the religions and
philosophies of heathendom," and thus to lead the unbeliever to

as Schaff says, almost a waste of learning.
It was written before
the Instructor, as we learn from a reference to it in the latter
(chap. 1).
It is stated above (Bk. V. chap. 28, § 4), by the anony
mous writer against the Artemonites, that Clement wrote (at least
some of his works) before the time of Victor of Rome (i.e. before
192 A.D.), and hence Westcott concludes that this work was written
about 190, which cannot be far out of the way.

* The Instructor (o matóayoyos, or, as Eusebius calls it here,
Tpets re ot too on tyeypass uévov matóayoyov), is likewise extant, in
three books. The ... is chiefly of a moral and practical character,
designed to furnish the new convert with rules for the proper conduct
of his life over against the prevailing immoralities of the heathen.
Its date is approximately fixed by the fact that it was written after the
A. rhortation to which it refers, and before the Stromata, which
refers to it (see Strom. VI. 1).

Two fragments of it are found in the Chronicon Paschale, and are

at the instigation of friends, who urged him to commit to writing
the traditions which he had received from the ancient presbyters.
From Bk. IV. chap. 26, we learn that it was written in reply to
Melito's work on the same subject (see notes 5 and 23 on that chap
ter); and hence we may conclude that it was undertaken at the
solicitation of friends who desired to see the arguments presented b
Melito, as a representative of the Quartodeciman practice, resuted.
The date of the work we have no means of ascertaining, for Melito's

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

to Alexander, the bishop mentioned above.
In the Stromata, he has not only treated
extensively" of the Divine Scripture, but he
also quotes from the Greek writers whenever any
thing that they have said seems to him profitable.
He elucidates the opinions of many, both
Greeks and barbarians. He also refutes the
false doctrines of the heresiarchs, and besides
this, reviews a large portion of history, giving us
specimens of very various learning; with all the
rest he mingles the views of philosophers.
It is
likely that on this account he gave his work the

appropriate title of Stromata."

He makes use also in these works of testi
monies from the disputed Scriptures," the
so-called Wisdom of Solomon," and of Jesus,
the son of Sirach, and the Epistle to the He
brews," and those of Barnabas," and Clement"

it.
It is no longer extant, but a few fragments have been preserved,
and are given by Potter.
Danz (De }%. p. 90) refers to Clement's Stromtata, lib. VI.
p. 803, ed. Potter, where o: says that "the ecclesiastical canon is
the agreement or disagreement of the law and the prophets with the
testament given at the coming of Christ."
I)anz concludes accord
ingly that in this work Clement wished to show to those who be
lieved that the teaching of the law and the prophets was not only
different from, but superior to the teachings of the Christian faith,
- that is, to the Judaizers, - that the writers of the Old and New
Testaments were in full harmony. This might do, were it not for
the fact that the work is directed not against Jews, but against Juda
izers, i.e. Judaizing Christians. . A work to prove the Old and New
Testament in harmony with each other could hardly have been ad
dressed to such persons,
ho must have believed them in harmony
before they became Christians. The truth is, the phrase, kaviov
oxx Amataorukós is used by the Fathers with a great variety of mean
ings, and the fact that Clement used it in one sense in one of his
works by no means proves that he always used it in the same sense.
It is more probable that the work was devoted to a discussion of
certain practices or modes of living in which the Judaizers differed
from the rest of the Church Catholic, perhaps in respect to feasts
(might a reference to the Quartodeciman practice have been o
included?), fasts and other ascetic practices, observance of the Jew

very common (see Suicer's Thesaurus). The work was dedicated,
according to Eusebius, to the bishop Alexander, mentioned above in
chap. 8 and elsewhere.
This is sufficient evidence that it was writ
ten considerably later than the three great works already referred to.
Alexander was a student of Clement's; and since he was likewise a
fellow-pupil of Origen's (see chap. 8, note 6), his student days under
Clement must have extended at so nearly to the time when Clem

cate a work to him. We think naturally of the period which Clem
ent spent with him while he was in prison and before he became
bishop of Jerusalem (see chap. 11).
It is quite possible that Clem
ent's residence in Cappadocia with Alexander had given him such
an acquaintance with Judaizing heresies and practices that he felt
constrained to write against them, and at the same time had given
him such an affection for Alexander that he dedicated his work to

is The Wisdom of Solomon and the Wisdom of Sirach were two
Old Testament apocryphal books. The Church of the first three
centuries made, on the whole, no essential difference between the
books of the Hebrew canon and the Apocrypha. We find the Fathers,
almost without exception, quoting from both indiscriminately.
It is
true that catalogues were made by Melito, Origen, Athanasius, and
others, which separated the Apocrypha from the books of the He
brew canon; but this represented theory simply; not practice, and

tion between the two, in theory as well as in practice. The only one
of the early Fathers to make a decided stand against the Apocrypha
was Jerome; but he was not able to change the common view, and
the Church continued (as the Catholic Church continues still) to use
them all (with a few minor exceptions) as Holy Scripture.

* This Cassianus is mentioned twice by Clement: once in Strom.
I. 21, where Clement engages in a chronological study for the pur
pose of showing that the wisdom of the Hebrews is older than that
of the Greeks, and refers to Cassian's Fregetica and Tatian's A &-

again in Strom. III. 13 sqq., where he is said to have been the founder

seems from these references to have been, like Tatian, an apologist
for Christianity, and also like him to have gone off into an extreme
asceticism, which the Church pronounced heretical (see Bk. IV.
chap. 29, note 4). Whether he was personally connected with Ta
tian, or is mentioned with him by Clement simply because his views
were similar, we do not know, nor can we fix the date at which he
lived.
Neither of his works referred to by Clement is now extant.
Jerome (de for. o. chap. 38) mentions the work which Eusebius
speaks of here, but says that he had not been able to find a copy of it.
It is called by Clement, in the passage referred to here by Eusebius,
"Ečnymrukoi, and so Eusebius calls it in his Praef. Evang. X. 12,
where he quotes from Clement. But here he speaks of it as a xpo
voypadia, and Jerome transcribes the word without translating it.
We can gather from Clement's words (Strom. I. 21) that the work
of Cassianus dealt largely with chronology, and hence Eusebius'
reference to it under the name Xpovoypadia is quite legitimate.

* On Philo and his works, see Bk. II. chaps. 4, 5, 17 and 18.
* The Aristobulus referred to here was an Alexandrian Jew
and Peripatetic philosopher (see the passages in Clement and Euse.
bius referred to below), who lived in the second century b.c., and
was the author of Commentaries woon the J/osaic Lazo, the chief
object of which was to prove that Greek philosophy was borrowed
from the books of Moses (see Clement, Strom. & 14, who refers
only to Peripatetic philosophy, which is too narrow). The work is
referred to by Clement of Alexandria (in his Stromata, I. 15: V.
14; VI: 3, &c.), by Eusebius (in his Prao. Ezang. VII. 14: VIII.
9, 18; XIII. 12, &c.), by Anatolius (as quoted by Eusebius below,
in Bk. VII. chap. 32), and by other Fathers. The work is no longer
extant, but Eusebius gives two considerable fragments of it in his

Demetrius
is mentioned by Josephus (who, however, wrongly makes him a
heathen; contra A/oronent, I. 23), by Clement o: Alexandria, and
by Eusebius.
His work is no longer extant, but fragments of it are
preserved by Clement (Strom. I. 21), and by Eusebius (Prao.
*g"; IX. 21 and 29). See Schürer, foif. p. 730 sq.
*. Eupolymus was also a Jewish historian, who wrote about the
middle ...}}. second century B.C., and is possibly to be identified
with the Eupolymus mentioned in 1. Macc. viii. 17. He wrote a
History of the 7ews, which is referred to under various titles by
those that mention it, and which has consequently been resolved
into three separate works by many scholars, but without warrant,
as Schürer has shown. The work, like that of Aristobulus, was
clearly designed to show the dependence of Greek philosophy upon
Hebrew wisdom (see Clement's Strom. I. 23).
It is no longer
extant, but fragments have been preserved by Clement of Alexan
dria (Stromt. 1. 21, which gives us data for reckoning the time at
which Eupolymus wrote, and I. 23) and by Eusebius (Praep. Evang.
IX: 17, 26, 30-34, and probably 39).

tolic seeds." Clement in this passage does not mean to assert that
his teachers were immediate disciples of the apostles, but only that
they received the traditions of the apostles in direct descent from

Passover" he acknowledges that he had
been urged by his friends to commit to writ

heard from the ancient presbyters; and in the
same work he mentions Melito and Irenaeus,
and certain others, and gives extracts from their
writings.

CHAPTER XIV.

The Scriptures mentioned by him.

Hypotyposes'

abridged accounts

To sum up briefly, he has given in the
of all
canonical Scripture, not omitting the disputed
books, *- I refer to Jude and the other Catho
lic
epistles, and Barnabas" and the so
called Apocalypse of Peter." He says that
the Epistle to the Hebrews" is the work of
Paul, and that it was written to the Hebrews in
the Hebrew language; but that Luke translated
it carefully and published it for the Greeks, and
hence the same style of expression is found
in this epistle and in the Acts.
But he says
that the words, Paul the Apostle, were prob
ably not prefixed, because, in sending it to the
Hebrews, who were prejudiced and suspicious
of him, he wisely did not wish to repel them at
the very beginning by giving his name.
Farther on he says: "But now, as the
blessed presbyter said, since the Lord be
ing the apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the
Hebrews, Paul, as sent to the Gentiles, on ac
count of his modesty did not subscribe himself
an apostle of the Hebrews, through respect for
the Lord, and because being a herald and apos
tle of the Gentiles he wrote to the Hebrews out

of his superabundance."

Again, in the same books, Clement gives
the tradition of the earliest presbyters, as
to the order of the Gospels, in the following
manner: The Gospels containing the gene

their immediate disciples.
Fusebius' words are a little ambiguous,
but they seem to imply that he thought that Clement was a pupil of
immediate disciples of the apostles, which Clement does not assert
in this passage, and can hardly have asserted in any passage, for he
was in all probability born too late to converse with those who
had seen any of the apostles.

* In his Stromtata (VI. 18) Clement refers to a work on the
origin of the world, which was probably to form a part of his work
On Principles.
This is perhaps the reference of which Eusebius
is thinking when he says that Clement in the Stromata promises

Gospel according to Mark" had this occasion.
As Peter had preached the Word publicly at
Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit,
many who were present requested that Mark,
who had followed him for a long time and re
membered his sayings, should write them out.
And having composed the Gospel he gave
it to those who had requested it. When
Peter learned of this, he neither directly for
bade nor encouraged it.
But, last of all, John,
perceiving that the external' facts had been made
plain in the Gospel, being urged by his friends,
and inspired by the Spirit, composed a spiritual
Gospel."

This is the account of Clement.

in a certain letter to Origen, refers to Clem

* Mentioned already in chaps. 8 and 11.
10 We see from this sentence that at the time of the writing of
this epistle both Pantaenus and Clement were dead. The latter was
still alive when Alexander wrote to the Antiochenes (see chap. 11),
i.e. about the year 211 (see note 5 on that chapter). How much
longer he lived we cannot tell. The epistle referred to here must
of course have been written at any rate subsequent to the year 211,
and hence while Alexander was bishop of Jerusalem. The expres
sion "with whom we shall soon be '' (mpos ous wer' oatyov to oueta)
seems to imply that the epistle was written, when Alexander and
Origen were advanced in life, but this cannot be pressed.

11. It is from this passage that we gather that Alexander was a
student of Clement's and a fellow-pupil of Origen's (see chap. 8,
note 6, and chap. 2, note 1). The . does not state this directly,
but the conclusion seems sufficiently obvious.
** The name Adamantius *... from ağalı as uncon
guerable, hence hard, adamagotose), is said, by Jerome (Ep., ad
Paulam, § 3; Migne's ed. Ep. XXXIII.) to have been given him
on account of his untiring industry, by Photius (Cod. 118) on account
of the invincible force of his arguments; and by Epiphanius (Harr;
LXIV. 74) to have been vainly adopted by himself.
But Eusebius'
simple statement at this point looks rather as if A damantius was a
second name which belonged to Origen from the beginning, and had
no reference to his character. We know that two names were very
common in that age. This opinion is adopted o Tillemont, Rede
penning, Westcott, and others, although many still hold the opposite
view. Another name, Chalcenterus, given to him by Jerome in the
epistle already referred to, was undoubtedly, as we can see from the
context, * to him by Jerome, because of his resemblance to
Didymus of Alexandria (who bore that surname) in his immense
industry as an author.

After a short stay there he returned to

BUT when he saw that he had not time for
the deeper study of divine things, and for the
investigation and interpretation of the Sacred
Scriptures, and also for the instruction of those
who came to him, - for coming, one after
another, from morning till evening to be taught
by him, they scarcely gave him time to breathe,
- he divided the multitude. And from those
whom he knew well, he selected Heraclas, who
was a zealous student of divine things, and in
other respects a very learned man, not igno
rant of philosophy, and made him his asso
ciate in the work of instruction. He entrusted
to him the elementary training of beginners,
but reserved for himself the teaching of those
who were farther advanced.

research

So earnest and assiduous was Origen's
into the divine words that he
learned the Hebrew language,' and procured as
his own the original Hebrew Scriptures which
were in the hands of the Jews. He investigated
also the works of other translators of the Sacred
Scriptures besides the Seventy." And in addi

that Eusebius is incorrect in putting it among the events occurring
during Caracalla's reign (21 1-2 17). On the other hand, it must
have taken place before the year 216, for in that year Origen went
to Palestine (see chap. 19, note 23) and remained there some time.
Whether Origen's visit was undertaken simply from the desire to see
the church of Rome, as Eusebius says, or in connection with matters
of business, we cannot tell.

* On Demetrius' relations to Origen, see chap. 8, note 4.
* On Heraclas, see chap. 3, note 2.
* Origen's study of the Hebrew, which, according to Jerome (de
zor. ill. chap. 54), was "contrary to the custom of his day and race,"
is not at all surprising. He felt that he needed some knowledge of
it as a basis for his study of the Scriptures to which he had devoted
himself, and also as a means of comparing the Hebrew and Greek
texts of the Old Testament, a labor which he regarded as very impor
tant for polemical purposes. As to his familiarity with the Hebrew it
is now universally conceded that it was by no means so great as was

to enable him to identify the Hebrew which corresponded with the
Greek texts which he used, and even in this he often makes mistakes.
He sometimes confesses openly his lack of critical and independent
knowledge of the Hebrew (e.g. Hom. in Mum. XIV. 1; XVI. 4).
He often makes blunders which seem absurd, and yet in many cases
he shows considerable knowledge in regard to peculiar forms and
idioms.
His Hebrew learning was clearly fragmentary, and ac
quired from various sources.

* Aquila is

first mentioned by Irenaeus (Adv. Pfarr. Il 1. 21.
1, quoted by Eusebius, Bk. V. chap. 8, above), who calls him a
Jewish proselyte of Pontus; Epiphanius says of Sinope in Pontus.
Tradition is uniform that he was a Jewish proselyte, and that he
lived in the time of Hadrian, or in the early part of the second cen
tury according to Rabbinic tradition. He produced a Greek trans
lation of the Old Testament, which was very slavish in its adherence
to the original, sacrificing the Greek idiom to the Hebrew without
mercy, and even violating the grammatical structure of the former
for the sake of reproducing the czact form of the latter.
Because
of its faithfulness to the original, it was highly prized by the Rab
binic authorities, and became more popular among the Jews in gen
gral than the LXX. (On the causes of the waning popularity of the
latter, see note 8, below.) . Neither Aquila's version, nor the two
following, are now extant; but numerous fragments have been pre
served by those Fathers who saw and used Origen's He-rafola.

* Symmachus is said by Eusebius, in the next chapter, to have
been an Ebionite; and Jerome agrees with him (Comment. in Ha*.,
lib. II. c. 3), though the testimony of the latter is weakened by the
fact that he wrongly makes Theodotion also an Ebionite (see next
note).
It has been claimed that Symmachus was a Jew, not a
Christian; but Eusebius' direct statement is too strong to be set
aside, and is corroborated by certain indications in the version itself,
e.g. in Dan. ix. 26, where the word xocards, which Aquila avoids,
is used. The composition of his version is assigned by Epiphanius
and the Chron. Anschafe to the reign of Septimius §...'. (193211); and although not much reliance is to be placed upon their
statements, still they must be about right in |. case, for that

not slavishly to reproduce the original, but to make an elegant and
idiomatic Greek translation, and in this he succeeded very well,
being excellently versed in both languages, though he sometimes
sacrificed the exact sense of the Hebrew, and occasionally altered it
under the influence of dogmatic prepossessions. The version is
spoken very highly of by Jerome, and was used freely by him in
the composition of the Vulgate.
For further particulars in regard
to Symmachus' version, see the Dict, of Christ. Frog. III. p. 19 sq
* It has been disputed whether Theodotion was a Jew or a §:
tian. Jerome (de vir. iii. 54, and elsewhere) calls him an Ebionite;
in his FA. ad A gustin. c. 19 (Migne's ed., Ep. 112), a Jew; while
in the preface to his commentary on Daniel he says that some called
him an Ebionite, Qui aftero genere 91, darus cst.
I renaeus (A ov.
Asaor. III. 21. , 1) and Epiphanius (de ments. et fond. 17) say that
he was a Jewish proselyte, which is probably true. The reports in
regard to his nationality are conflicting. The time at which he
lived is disputed. The Chron. Aaschale assigns him to the reign of
Commodus, and Epiphanius may also be urged in support of that
date, though he commits a serious blunder in making a second Com
modus, and is thus led into great confusion.
But Theodotion, as
well as Aquila, is mentioned by Irenaeus, and hence must be pushed
back well into the second century.
It has been discovered, too, that
Hermas used his version (see Hort's article in the Gohns Hofkirts
University. Circular, December, 1884), which obliges us to throw
it back still further, and Schürer has adduced some very strong
reasons for believing it older than Aquila's version (see Schürer's
Gesch. d. 9 na'en im Zeitaster jesw, II. p. 709). Theodotion's
version, like Aquila's, was intended to reproduce the Hebrew more
exactly than the LXX did.
It is based upon the LXX, however,
which it corrects by the Hebrew, and therefore resembles the former
much more closely than Theodotion's does. We have no notices of
the use of this version by the Jews.
Aquila's version (supposing it
ounger than Theodotion's) seems to have superseded it entirely.
Theodotion's translation of Daniel, however, was accepted by the
Christians, instead of the LXX Daniel, and replacing the latter in
all the MSS. of the LXX, has been preserved entire.
Aside from
this we have only such fragments as have been preserved by the
Fathers that saw and used the Afrirafla.
seen that the
order in which Eusebius mentions the three versions, here is not
chronological. He simply follows the order in which they stand in
Origen's Heraala (see below, note 8).
Epiphanius is led by that
order to make Theodotion's version later than the other, which is
quite a mistake, as has been seen.

Acfie Zitore, but Epiphanius, who seems to be speaking with more
exact knowledge than Jerome, says that the "fifth '' was discovered
at Jericho and the "sirth '' in Nicopolis, near Actium (De mens.
et Aond. 18). Jerome calls the authors of the "fifth " and "sixth"

when these versions were found, we are doubtless to assign the dis
covery of the one at Nicopolis near Actium to the visit made by
Epiphanius, who in

accuracy, puts its discovery into the time of the emperor Alexander
(222-235). The other one, which Epiphanius calls the "fisth," was
found, according to him, in the seventh year of Caracalla's reign
(217) "in jars at Jericho." We know that at this time Origen was in
Palestine (see chap. 19, note 23), and hence Epiphanius' report may
well be correct. #it is, he has good reason for calling the latter the

7 Nicopolis near Actium, so designated to distinguish it from a
number of other cities bearing the same name, was a city of Epirus,
lying on the northern shore of the Ambracian gulf, opposite the
promontory of Actium.

* Origen's He rap/a (rá čam Aa, to £am Aoûv, to €8 aoréAtôov, the
first form being used by Eusebius in this chapter) was a polyglot
Old Testament containing the Hebrew text, a transliteration of it
in Greek letters (important because the Hebrew text was unpointed),
the versions of Aquila, of Symmachus, of the LXX, and of Theodo
tion, arranged in six columns in the order named, with the addition
in certain places of a fifth, sixth, and even seventh Greek version
(see Jerome's description of it, in his Commentary on Titus, chap.
3, ver, 9). The parts which contained these latter versions were
sometimes called Octapla (they seem never to have borne the name
nonapola). The order of the columns was determined by the fact
that Aquila's version most closely resembled the Hebrew, and hence
was put next to it, followed by Symmachus' version, which was
based directly upon the Hebrew, but was not so closely conformed
to it; while Theodotion's version, which was based not upon the
Hebrew, but upon the LXX, naturally followed the latter.
Origen's
object in undertaking this great work was not scientific, but polemic;
it was not for the sake of securing a correct Hebrew text, but for the
purpose of furnishing adequate means for the reconstruction of the
original text of the LXX, which in his day was exceedingly corrupt.
It was Origen's belief, and he was not alone in his opinion (cf.
Justin Martyr's Dial. with Trypho, chap. 71), that the Hebrew
Old Testament had been seriously altered by the Jews, and that the
LXX (an inspired translation, as it was commonly held to be by the
Christians) alone represented the true form of Scripture.
For two
centuries before and more than a century after Christ the LXX
stood in high repute among the Jews, even in Palestine, and outside
of Palestine had almost completely taken the place of the original
Hebrew. Under the influence of its universal use among the Jews
the Christians adopted it, and looked upon it as inspired Scripture
just as truly as if it had been in the original tongue.
Early in the
second century (as Schiirer points out) various causes were at work
to lessen its reputation among the Jews.
Chief among these were
first, the growing conservative reaction against all non-Hebraic
culture, which found its culmination in the Rabbinic schools of the
second century; and second, the ever-increasing hostility to Chris
tianity. The latter cause tended to bring the LXX into disfavor
with the Jews, because it was universally employed by the Chris
tians, and was cited in favor of Christian doctrines in many cases
where it differed from the Hebrew text, which furnished less support
to the particular doctrine defended.
It was under the influence of
this reaction against the LXX, which undoubtedly began even
before the second century, that the various versions already men
tioned took their rise.
Aquila especially aimed to keep the Hebrew
text as pure as possible, while making it accessible to the Greek
speaking Jews, who had hitherto been obliged to rely upon the LXX.
It will be seen that the Christians and the Jews, who originally
accepted the same Scriptures, would gradually draw apart, the one
party still holding to the LXX, the other going back to the original:
and the natural consequence of this was that the Jews taunted the

prominent translations, he adds not only a fifth,
but also a sixth and seventh." He states of one
of these that he found it in a jar in Jericho in
the time of Antoninus, the son of Severus.
Having collected all of these, he divided
them into sections, and placed them opposite
each other, with the Hebrew text itself. He
thus left us the copies of the so-called Hexapla.
He arranged also separately an edition of Aquila
and Symmachus and Theodotion with the Sep
tuagint, in the Tetrapla."
Christians with using only a translation which did not agree with
the original, and therefore was of no authority, while the Christians,
on the other hand, accused the Jews of falsifying their Scriptures,
which should agree with the more pure and accurate LXX.
nder
these circumstances, Origen conceived the idea that it would be of
great advantage to the Christians, in their polemics against the ło,
to know more accurately than they did the true form of the xx
text, and the extent and nature of its variations from the Hebrew.
As the matter stood everything was indefinite, for no one knew to
exactly what extent the two differed, and no one knew, in the face
of the numerous variant texts, the precise form of the LXX itself
(cf. Redepenning, II. p. 156 sq.). The Hebrew text given by Origen
seems to fo been the vulgar text, and to have differed little from
that in use to-day. With the LXX it was different. Here Origen
made a special effort to ascertain the most correct text, and did not
content himself with giving simply one of the numerous texts extant,
for he well knew that all were more or less corrupt.
But his method
was not to throw out of the text all passages not well supported by
the various witnesses, but rather to enrich the text from all available
sources, thus making it as full as possible. Wherever, therefore,
the Hebrew to: a passage omitted in the LXX, he inserted in
the latter the translation of the passage, taken from one of the other
versions, marking the addition with "obeli"; and wherever, on the
other hand, the fullest LXX text which he had contained more than
the Hebrew and the other versions combined, he allowed the redun
dant passage to stand, but marked it with asterisks. The He-rafia as
a whole seems never to have been reproduced, but the LXX text as
contained in the fifth column was multiplied many times, especially
under the direction of Pamphilus and Eusebius *... had the original
M.S. at Caesarea), and this recension came into common use.
It will
be seen that Origen's process must have wrought great confusion in
the text of the LXX; for future copyists, in reproducing the text given
by Origen, would be prone to neglect the critical signs, and give the
whole as the correct form of the LXX; and critical editors to-day
find it very difficult to reach even the form of the LXX text used
by Origen. The He rap/a is no longer extant. When the Caesarean
MS. of it perished we do not know. Jerome saw it, and made large
use of it, but after his time we have no further trace of it, and it
probably perished with the rest of the Caesarean library before the
end of the seventh century, perhaps considerably earlier. Numerous
editions have been published op the fragments of the Hera//a,
taken from the works of the Fathers, from Scholia in MSS. of the
LXX, and from a Syriac version of the Hexaplar LXX, which is
still in large part extant. The best edition is that of Field, in two

Origen seems to have commenced his great work in Alexandria.
This is implied by the account of Eusebius, and is stated directly b
Epiphanius (Harr. LXIV. 3), who says that this was the first wor
§. he undertook at the solicitation of Ambrose (see chap. 18).
We may accept this as in itself quite probable, for there could be no
better foundation for his exegetical labors than just such a piece of
critical work, and the numerous scribes surnished him by Ambrose
(see chap. 18) may well have devoted themselves largely to this
very work, as Roo. remarks.
But the work was by no
means completed at once. The time of his discovery of the other
versions of the Old Testament (see above, note 6) in itself shows
that he continued his labor upon the great edition for many years
(the late discovery of these versions may perhaps explain the fact
that he did not use them in connection with all the books of the Old
Testament?); and Epiphanius (de mens. et fond. 18) . that he
was engaged upon it }. twenty-eight years, and completed it, at
Tyre. This is quite likely, and will explain the fact that the MS.

Field, however,
maintains that our sources do not permit us to fix the time or place
either of the commencement or ..". completion of the work with
any degree of accuracy (see p. xlviii. sq.).

9 Walesius remarks that there is an inconsistency here, and that
it should be said "not only a fifth and sixth, but also a seventh."
All the MSS. and versions, however, support the reading of the
text, and we must therefore suppose the inconsistency (if there is
one, which is doubtful) to be Eusebius' own, not that of a scribe.

The 7Fanslator Symmachus.'

As to these translators it should be stated
that Symmachus was an Ebionite.
But the
heresy of the Ebionites, as it is called, asserts
that Christ was the son of Joseph and Mary,
considering him a mere man, and insists strongly
on keeping the law in a Jewish manner, as we
have seen already in this history." Commen
taries of Symmachus are still extant in which he
appears to support this heresy by attacking the
Gospel of Matthew." Origen states that he ob
tained these and other commentaries of Sym
machus on the Scriptures from a certain Juliana,"
who, he says, received the books by inheritance
from Symmachus himself.

For a discussion of Ebionism, see the

Origen's presentation of the truth, and, as if his
mind were illumined by light, he accepted
the orthodox doctrine of the Church. Many
others also, drawn by the fame of Origen's
learning, which resounded everywhere, came to
him to make trial of his skill in sacred litera
ture. And a great many heretics, and not a few
of the most distinguished philosophers, studied
under him diligently, receiving instruction from
him not only in divine things, but also in
secular philosophy.
For when he perceived
that any persons had superior intelligence
he instructed them also in philosophic branches
- in geometry, arithmetic, and other prepara
tory studies -and then advanced to the sys
tems" of the philosophers and explained their
writings. And he made observations and com
ments upon each of them, so that he became
celebrated as a great philosopher even
among the Greeks themselves. And he
instructed many of the less learned in the
common school branches," saying that these
would be no small help to them in the study
and understanding of the Divine Scriptures. On
this account he considered it especially neces
sary for himself to be skilled in secular and
philosophic learning."

* Of the early life of Ambrose, the friend of Origen, we know
nothing. We learn from Origen's Exhortatio ad J/artyr. c. 14,
and Jerome's de vir. o. c. 56, that he was of a wealthy and noble
family (cf. chap. 23 of this book), and from the Erhart. ad Mart.
c. 36, that he probably held some high official position.
Eusebius
says here that he was for some time a Valentinian, Jerome that he
was a Marcionite, others give still different reports. However that
was, the authorities all agree that he was converted to the orthodox
faith by Origen, and that he remained devoted to him for the rest of
his life.
From chap. 23 we learn that he urged Origen to undertake
the composition of commentaries on the Scriptures, and that he fur
nished ample pecuniary means for the prosecution of the work. He
was also himself a diligent student, as we gather from that chapter (cf.
also Jerome, de 7 or ol. c. 56).
From chap. 28 we learn that he was
a confessor in the persecution of Maximinus (Jerome calls him also
a deacon), and it seems to have been in Caesarea or its neighborhood
that he suffered, whither he had gone undoubtedly on account of his
affection for Origen, who was at that time there (cf. the Erhart.
c. 41). He is mentioned for the last time in the dedication and con
clusion of Origen's Contra Ce/st mo, which was written between 246
and 250 (see chap. 36, below). Jerome (*.c.) states that he died before
Origen, so that he cannot have lived long after this. He left no
writings, except some epistles which are no longer extant.

however, in his A.A. ad Marcellam, $ 1 (Migne's ed., E.A. 43), at

§ giving it a firmer philosophic basis than it had hitherto possessed.
eo-Platonism, taken as a whole, has therefore both a philosophic
and a religious motive.
It may be defined in the briefest terms, in
its philosophic aspect, as an eclectic revival of Greek metaphysics
(especially Platonic-Aristotelian), modified by the influence of Ori
ental philosophy and of Christianity; in its religious aspect, as an
attempt to restore and regenerate paganism by means of philosophy.
In its earlier and better days, the philosophic element greatly pre
been, in large part, a later growth; but oy the latter came
dominated, -in fact, the religious element may be said to have
more and more into the foreground, until, under Jamblichus (d.
330 A.D.), the chief master of the Syrian school, Neo-Platonism de
generated into a system of religious mysteries, in which the urgic
practices played a prominent part. Under Proclus (d. 485), the
great master of the Athenian school, the philosophic element was
again emphasized; but Aristotelianism now gained the predominance,
and the system became a sort of scholastic art, and gradually degen
crated into pure formalism, until it finally lost all influence. The
extent of the influence which Christianity exerted upon Neo-Platon
ism is a greatly disputed point. We shall, perhaps, come nearest
the truth if we say that its influence was in the main not direct, but
that it was nevertheless real, inasmuch as it had introduced prob
lems up to that time undiscussed, with which Neo-Platonism busied
itself; in fact, it may almost be said that Neo-Platonism was at first
little more than (Aristotelian-) Platonism busying itself with the
new problems of salvation and redemption which Christianity had
thrown into the world of thought.
It was un-Christian at first (it
became under Porphyry and later Neo-Platonists anti-Christian),
because it solved these problems in a way different from the Chris
tian way. This will explain the fact that all through, whether in the
more strictly philosophic system of Plotinus, or in the more mark
edly religious and the urgic system of Jamblichus, there ran a vein
of mysticism, the conception of an intimate union with the supreme
God as the highest state to which man can attain.

Porphyry, with whom we are at present concerned, was emi
nently practical in his thinking. The end of philosophy with him
was not knowledge, but holiness, the salvation of the soul. He
recommended a moderate asceticism as a chief means of freeing the
soul from the bonds of matter, and thus permitting it to rise to union
with God. At the same time, he did not advise the neglect of the
customary religious rites of Paganism, which might aid in the eleva
tion of the spirit of man toward the deity.
It was with Porphyry
that Neo-Platonism first came into direct conflict with Christianity,
and its enmity against the latter goes far to explain, the increasing
emphasis which he and the Neo-Platonists, who followed him laid
upon religious rites and practices.
Its philosophy, its solution of
the great problems of the age, was essentially and radically different
from that of Christianity; and although at first they might run
alongside one another as independent schools, without much thought
of conflict, it was inevitable that in time the rivalry, and then the
active hostility, should come.
Neo-Platonism, like Christianity, had
a solution of the great problem of living to offer to the world, - in
an age of ...! corruption, when thoughtful men were all
seeking for a solution, - and each was essentially exclusive of the
other. The attack, therefore, could not be long delayed.
Porphyry
seems to have begun it in his famous work in fifteen books, now lost,
which was answered in ertenso by Methodius of Tyre, Eusebius, and
Apolinarius of Laodicea. The answers, too, have perished; but from
extant fragments we are able to see that Porphyry's attack was very
learned and able. He endeavored to point out the inconsistencies
in the sacred narrative, in order to discredit its divine origin.
At
the same time, he treated Christ with the greatest respect, and
ranked him very high as a sage (though only human), and found
much that was good in his teaching.
Augustine (/), consensu
Evang. I. 15) says that the Neo-Platonists praised Christ, but railed
at his disciples (cf. Eusebius' words in this chapter).
Porphyry was
a very prolific writer; but only a few of his works are now extant,
chief among them the adopual mpos Ta womra, or Sententiae, a brief
but comprehensive exposition of his philosophic system. We learn
from this chapter that he had met Origen when very young (he was
but about twenty when Origen died); where, we do not know. He
lived to be at least sixty-eight years old (see his L'ita Plot. 23), and
Suidas says that he died under Diocletian, i.e. before 305 A.D.

On Porphyry and Neo-Platonism in general, see the great works
of Vacherot (Host. critizwe de l'Ecole d'A/e-randrie) and Simon

* Of the life of Ammonius Saccas, the "father of Neo-Platonism,"
very little is known. He is said by Suidas (s. v. Origenes) and by
Ammianus Marcellinus to have been a porter in his youth and to
have gained his second name from his occupation. That he was of
Christian parents and afterward embraced paganism is stated in this
passage by Porphyry, though Eusebius (§ 10, below) and Jerome
assert that he remained a Christian.
From all that we know of the
teachings of Ammonius Saccas as reported to us, by Plotinus and
other Neo-Platonists, we cannot imagine him to have remained a
Christian. The only solution of the difficulty then is to suppose Euse
bius (whom Jerome follows) to have confounded him with a Christian
of the same name who wrote the works which Eusebius mentions (see
note 16). Ammonius was an Alexandrian by birth and residence, and
died in 243. ... His teaching was of a losty and noble character, to
judge from Plotinus' descriptions, and as a teacher he was wonder
fully fascinating. He numbered among his pupils Herennius, Lon
ginus, the pagan Origen, and Plotinus. The Christian Origen also
studied id: him for a time, according to this passage. He wrote
nothing (according to the 17ta /'lot. c. 20), and hence we have to
rely solely upon the reports of his disciples and successors for our
knowledge | his system.
It is difficult in the absence of all direct
testimony to ascertain his teaching with exactness. Plotinus claims
to give only what he learned from Ammonius, but it is evident, from
his disagreement in many points with others of Ammonius' disciples,
that the system taught § him was largely modifico by his own
thinking.
It is clear that Ammonius, who undoubtedly took much

knowledge, is not at all surprising, for Origen's attainments in secu

would have acquired.

* Numenius was a philosopher of Syria, who lived about the
middle of the second century, and who exerted great influence over
Plotinus and others of the R. He was, perhaps, the
earliest of the Orientalizing Greek philosophers whose thinking was
affected by the influence of Christian ideas, and as such occupies an
important place in the development of philosophy, which prepared
the way for Neo-Platonism. His object seems to have been to recon
cile Pythagoras and Plato by tracing the doctrines of the latter back
to the former, and also to exhibit their agreement with Jewish and
other Oriental forms of thought.
It is significant that he was called
by the Church Fathers a Pythagorean, and that he himself called Plato
a Greek-speaking Moses (cf. Erdmann's Hist, of Phil. I. p. 236).
He was a prolific writer, but only fragments of his works are extant.
Numerous extracts from the chief of them (rept rāya boy) have been
Fo by Eusebius in his Praep. Evang. (see Heinichen's ed.
" Of Cronius, a celebrated Pythagorean philosopher, apparently
a contemporary of Numenius, and closely related to him in his
thinking, we know very little. A brief account of him is given by
Porphyry in his lotta Plot; 20.
* The Apollophanes referred to here was a Stoic philosopher of
Antioch who lived in the third century B.c., and was a disciple of
Ariston of Chios. None of his writings are extant.
* Longinus was a celebrated philosopher and rhetorician of
Athens, who was born about 213 on ". in 273 A.D. He traveled
widely in his youth, and was for a time a pupil of Ammonius Saccas
at Alexandria; but he remained a genuine Platonist, and seems not
to have been influenced by the eclecticism of the Neo-Platonists.
He was a man of marked ability, of the broadest culture, and a
thorough master of Greek style.
Of his numerous writings we
possess a large part of one beautiful work entitled Tept to lovs (often
published), and fragments of some others (c.g. in Eusebius' Prof.
Fzang. XV. 21).
Longinus was the teacher of Porphyry before
the latter went to Rome to study under Plotinus.

Porphyry has made a mistake in classing Longinus with those
other philosophers whose works Origen studied. He was a younger
contemporary of Origen, and cannot even have studied with Ammo
nius until after Origen had left Alexandria.
It is possible, of course,
that Origen in later life read some of his works; but Porphyry
evidently means that the works of all the philosophers, Longinus
among them, had an influence upon Origen's intellectual develop
ment.
Heinichen reads 'AABt vou instead of Aoyyivou in his text, on
the assumption that Porphyry cannot possibly have written Aoyyivov;
but the latter word has . support of all the MSS. and versions,
and there is no warrant for making the change. We must simply
conclude that Porphyry, who, of course, is not pretending to give
an exact list of all the philosophical works which Origen had read,
classes Longinus, the ... philosopher, along with the rest, as
one whose works such a student of Greek philosophy as, Origen
must have read, without thinking of the serious anachronism
involved.

* Moderatus was a distinguished Pythagorean philosopher of the

These things are said by Porphyry in the
third book of his work against the Chris
tians." He speaks truly of the industry and
learning of the man, but plainly utters a false
hood (for what will not an opposer of Christians
do?) when he says that he went over from the
Greeks," and that Ammonius fell from a life
of piety into heathen customs.
For the
doctrine of Christ was taught to Origen by
his parents, as we have shown above. And Am
monius held the divine philosophy unshaken and

and friends the poet Persius. Most of his numerous works have
perished, but one on the Nature of the Gods is still extant in a
mutilated form (see Gall's Opuscula).
See Suidas (s.a. Kopwooros)
and Dion Cassius, XLII. 29.
13 Origen was not the Hist to interpret the Scriptures allegori
cally. The method began among the Alexandrian Jews some time
before the Christian era, the effort being made to reconcile the
Mosaic revelation with Greek philosophy, and to find in the former
the teachings of the latter.
This effort appears in many of the
apocryphal books, but the great exponent of the method was the
Alexandrian Philo.
It was natural that the early Christians, espe
cially in Alexandria, should be influenced by this already existing
method of interpretation, which enabled them to make of the Old
Testament a Christian book, and to find in it all the teachings of the

le of interpretation its adoption by the Christian Church. Had it
en looked upon as the Jewish Scriptures only, containing Jewish
national history, and in large part Jewish national prophecy, it
could never, have retained its hold upon the early {*. which
was so bitterly hostile to all that savored of Judaism. The early Gen
tile Christians were taught from the beginning by Jewish Christians
who could not do otherwise than look upon their national Scriptures
as divine, that those Scriptures contained prophecies of Jesus Christ,
and hence those Gentile Christians accepted them as divine.
But
it must be remembered that they could of course have no meaning
to these Gentile Christians except as they did prophesy of Christian
things or contain Christian teaching. They could not be content
to find Christian prophecy in one part and only Jewish history or
Jewish prophecy in another part. }. must all be Christian if it was
to have any meaning to them.
In this emergency the allegorical
method of interpretation, already practiced upon the Old Testament
by the Alexandrian Jews, came to their assistance and was cagerly
adopted. The so-called epistle of Barnabus is an early and most
significant instance of its use.
With Clement of Alexandria the
matter first took scientific shape. He taught that two senses are
everywhere to be assumed; that the verbal sense is only for babes
in the faith, and that the allegorical sense alone leads to true spirit
ual knowledge.
With Origen allegorical interpretation reached its
height. He taught a threefold sense of Scripture, corresponding to
body, soul, and spirit. Many voices were raised against his inter
pretation, but they were directed against his particular explanations
of the meaning of passages, seldom against his method.
In the
early centuries Alexandria remained the chief center of this kind of
exegesis, while Antioch became in the fifth century the seat of a
school of exegetes who emphasized rather the grammatical and his
torical interpretation of Scripture over against the extremes of the

from the vicious methods of the age, and, moreover, errors of various
kinds crept in to lessen their influence, and the allegorical method
finally prevailed almost universally; and it has not even yet fully
lost its hold.
This method of Scripture interpretation has, as Por
phyry says, its analogy in the methods of the Greek philosophers
during the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era.
It
became early the custom for philosophers, scandalized by the licen
tious stories of their gods, to interpret the current myths allegori
cally and refer them to the processes of nature. Homer and others
of the ancient poets were thus made by these later philosophers to
teach philosophies of nature of which they had never dreamed.
With the Neo-Platonists this method reached its highest
rfection,
and while the Christian teachers were allegorizing the Old Testa
ment Scriptures, these philosophers were transforming the popular
myths into records of the profoundest physical and spiritual pro
cesses. Porphyry saw that the method of pagans and Christians was
the same in this respect, and he may be correct in assigning some
influence to these writings in the shaping of Origen's thinking, but
the latter was an allegorist before he studied the philosophers to
whom Porphyry refers (cf. chap. i. , above), and would have

Moses and Jesus, and such others as are in
the possession of the learned. These things
are sufficient to evince the slander of the
false accuser, and also the proficiency of Origen
in Grecian learning. He defends his diligence
in this direction against some who blamed him
for it, in a certain epistle," where he writes as

follows:

"When I devoted myself to the word,
and the fame of my proficiency went abroad,
and when heretics and persons conversant with
Grecian learning, and particularly with philoso
phy, came to me, it seemed necessary that I
should examine the doctrines of the heretics,

the truth. And in this we have followed

and also Heraclas," who is now a member of

he had already continued five years before I
began to hear lectures on those subjects."
14 And though he had formerly worn the com

* This is certainly a mistake on Eusebius' part (see above, note
2), in which he is followed by Jerome (de zir. W. c. 55).
Against
the identification of the Christian Ammonius, whose works are men
tioned by Eusebius and Jerome, with Ammonius Saccas, may be
urged first the fact that the teaching of Ammonius Saccas, as known
to us from Porphyry's Vita Plotini and from other Neo-Platonic
sources, is not . as could have emanated from a Christian; and,
in the second place, the fact that the Christian Ammonius, accord
ing to Eusebius, was the author of more than one important work,
while Longinus (as quoted by Porphyry in the Jota Plot. c. 20)
says explicitly that Ammonius Saccas wrote nothing.
It is clear
srom Eusebius' words that his sole reason for supposing that Ammo
nius Saccas remained a Christian is the existence of the writings to
which he refers; and it is quite natural that he and others should
erroneously attribute the works of an unknown Christian of Alexan
dria, named Ammonius, to the celebrated Alexandrian philosopher
of the same name, especially since it was known that the latter had
been a Christian in his youth, and that he had been Origen's teacher
in his mature years. We know nothing about the life of the Chris
tian Ammonius, unless he be identified with the presbyter Ammo
nius of Alexandria, who is said by Eusebius to have perished in the
persecution of Diocletian. The identification is possible; but even
if it be accepted, we are helped very little, for is only the death, not

mentions both these works (de vir. ii. 55), the latter under the
title Evangelic: Canones. He refers to these Canones again in
his preface to the Four Gospels (Migne's ed., Vol. X. 528); and so
does Victor of Capua. The former work is no longer extant, nor
have we any trace of it.
But there is extant a Latin translation of
a Diatessaron which was made by Victor of Capua, and which was
formerly, and is still, by many scholars supposed to be a version of
this work of Ammonius. By others it is thought to be a translation

Gradually, as the

various sources, which differ in regard to the years of the several

five years, and therefore his accession is to be put into the}. 217,

This agrees, so far as the years, of our era are con
cerned, with the statement of Eusebius in this chapter; but he
wrongly puts Callistus' accession into the first year of Alexander,
which is a result of an error of a year in his reckoning of the dates
of the emperors, which runs back to Pertinax (see Lipsius, P.; 7 sq.).
He does not assign Callistus' accession to the first year of Helioga

his reckoning of the lengths of the various episcopates, which were
given in the source used by him, led him to the year 21
for Cal

reigns of the emperors, was the first year of Heliogabalus. We thus

than had hitherto been in vogue; so lax as greatly to scandalize
Hippolytus, who was a very rigid disciplinarian. wi. truth
there may be in this highly sensational account (and we cannot
doubt that it is greatly overdrawn), it is at least certain that Callis
tus took the liberal view of Christian morals and church discipline,
over against the stricter view represented by Hippolytus and his
party.
It was, perhaps, owing to his popularity on this account
that, after the death of Zephyrinus, he secured the episcopacy of
Rome, for which Hippolytus was also a candidate. The latter tells
us also that Zephyrinus "set him over the cemetery,"-a most in
teresting notice, as the largest catacomb in Rome bears the name of
St. Callistus, and may
the very one of which Zephyrinus made
him the superintendent.

* Lipsius, in his Chron. d. , röm. Bischäse, p. 170 sq., shows
that the only fixed point for a calculation of the dates of Urban and
the three bishops preceding him, is the banishment by the Emperor
Maximinus of Pontianus to Sardinia, which took place, according to
the Liberian catalogue, while Severus and Quintinus were consuls:
that is, in the year 235. The duration of Pontianus' episcopate is
shown by a comparison of the best sources to have been a little over
five years (see chap. 23, note 3).
This brings us to the year 230 as
the date of Urban's death. According to chap. 23, Urban was bishop
eight years, and with this the Liberian catalogue agrees, so that
this figure is far better supported than the figure nine given by the
Chron.
Accepting eight years as the duration of Urban's episco
pate, we are brought back to 222 as the date of his accession, which
agrees with Eusebius' statement in this chapter (see the previous
note). There are extant Acta S. Urbani, which are accepted
as genuine by the Bollandists, and assigned to the second century,
but they cannot have been written before the fifth, and are histor
ically quite worthless.
For a good discussion of his supposed con
nection with St. Cecilia, which has played such an important part in
ecclesiastical legend, see the article Urða sizes in the Dict. of Christ.
A fog. We have no certain knowledge of his life and character.

* Elagabalus was slain in March, 222, after a reign of three years
and nine months, and was succeeded by his cousin, Alexianus Bas
sianus, who assumed the names Marcus Aurelius Alexander Severus,
by the last two of which he is commonly known.

* Philetus, according to the Chron. (Armenian), became bishop
in the sixth year of Caracalla (216), and was succeeded by Zebinus
in the sixth year of Alexander Severus (227). Jerome puts his
accession into the reign of Macrinus (217-218), and the accession
of Zebinus into the seventh year of Alexander (228). The acces
sion of Zebinus must have taken place at least as early as 231 (see
chap. 23, note 4), and there remains therefore no reason to doubt
the approximate accuracy of the latter dates.
If the dates given for
Philetus' accession (216-218) be approximately correct, we must
understand the words "at this time" of the present chapter, to refer
back to the reign of Macrinus, or the accession of Alexander Severus,
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. This does not seem
natural, but we cannot say it is impossible. Knowing the unrelia
bility of the dates given in the Chron., we are compelled to leave
the matter undecided. He is called by the Armen. Philip, by
Syncellus plantos o Pi Ammos. The latter assigns him an episcopate
*"... which agrees with none of the figures given by the
two versions of the Chronicle or by the History. We know nothing
about the person or the life of Philetus.

* On Asclepiades, see chap. 11, note 6.
* Julia Mamaea or Mammaea (Eusebius, Mau Maia) was the niece
of Septimius Severus' wife Julia Domna, the aunt of the Emperor
Elagabalus, and the mother of the Emperor Alexander Severus, by
the Syrian Gessius Marcianus.
She accompanied Elagabalus to
Rome, and had strength of character enough to protect her son from
the jealousy of the latter, and to keep him comparatively pure from
the vice and debauchery of the court.
During the reign of her son
she exerted great influence, which was in the main highly beneficial;
but her pride and avarice finally proved fatal, both to }. son and
to herself. Her character seems to have been in the main pure
and elevated; and she was apparently inclined to the same sort of
religious syncretism which le . son to adopt many Christian prin
ciples of action, and to put the busts of Abraham and of Christ, with
those of Orpheus, Ağıl. of Tyana, and the best of the Roman
emperors, in his private chapel (see Lampridius, Porta Sez. c. 29.
Fusebius calls Mammaea 6eoare Bea rarm and evaa8ms, and
3).
joom calls her a religiosa /emina (de 7.1 r. o.o.
c. 54); but there
is no evidence that she was a Christian. The date of Origen's inter
view with her has been greatly disputed. Huet and Redepenning,

by name, was a most pious woman, if there
ever was one, and of religious life. When the
fame of Origen had extended everywhere and
had come even to her ears, she desired greatly
to see the man, and above all things to make
trial of his celebrated understanding of
divine things.
Staying for a time in Antioch, she sent for him with a military escort.
Having remained with her a while and shown
her many things which were for the glory of the
Lord and of the excellence of the divine teach
ing, he hastened back to his accustomed work.

tion of Alexander.
Chron., that the Persian expedition took place in the early part
of Alexander's reign; but this is against à". ancient authori
ties, and must be incorrect (see Tillemont, Mem. III. 763 sq.).
The only occasions known to us, on which Mammaea can have been
in Antioch, were this expedition of her son (between 230 and 233)
and the visit of her nephew Elagabalus to Antioch, after his vic
..o.o...". in 218.
At both these times Origen was quite
probably in Caesarea (see chap. 19, note 23, and p. 393, below), whence
it is more natural to suppose him summoned than from Alexandria.
If we put the interview, in 218, we must suppose (as Tillemont sug
gests) that Eusebius is led by his mention of Alexander to give this
account of his mother, and that he does not intend to imply that the
interview took place after Alexander's accession. There is nothing
at all improbable in this.
In fact, it seems more likely that he would
mention the interview in connection with Alexander than in connec
tion with Elagabalus, in spite of ...'. On the other hand,
it is not impossible that the interview took place subsequently to the
year 231, for Origen's same was certainly by that time much greater
in Syria than fifteen years previous. . At the same time, to accept
this date disarranges seriously the chronological order of the ac
count of Eusebius, for in chap. 24 we are told of those works which
Origen wrote while yet in Alexandria; that is, before 231. More
over, there is not the same reason for inserting this account of
Mammaea at this point, if it occurred later in Alexander's reign, that
there is if it occurred in the reign of Elagabalus. We shall, there
fore, do best to accept the earlier date with Tillemont, Westcott, and
others.

1 Hippolytus (mentioned above in chap. 20) was one of the most
learned men and celebrated writers of his age, and yet his personal
history is involved in the deepest obscurity. The earliest mention
But
of him is by Eusebius in this passage and in chap. 29, above.
Eusebius tells us there only .. he was a bishop of "some other
church'' (trépas mov exkamorias), and Jerome (de for. o. c. 61) says
that he was a bishop of some church whose name he did not know
(///polytus, cujusda.m. Eccleszar o: momen quippo. urbis
score non petui).
In the East, from the fourth century on, Hippol
ytus was commonly called bishop of Rome, but the Western tradi
tion makes him simply a presbyter. The late tradition that he was
bishop of Portus Romanus is quite worthless. We learn from his
Philosophumena, or Refutation of Heresies, that he was active in
Rome in the time of Zephyrinus and Callistus; but what is signifi:
cant is the fact that he never recognizes Callistus as bishop of
Rome, but always treats him as the head of a school opposed to the

It seems
probable that he was a presbyter of the church of Rome, and was at
the head of a party o did not recognize Callistus as lawful bishop,
but set Hippolytus up as opposition bishop.
This explains why
Hippolytus calls himself a bishop, and at the same time, recognizes
neither'Callistus nor any one else as bishop of Rome. The Western
Church therefore preserved the tradition of Hippolytus only as a
presbyter, while in the Orient, where Hippolytus was known only
through his works, the tradition that he was a bishop (a fact o
stated in those works; see the preface to his Philosoph to "terta) al
ways prevailed; and since he was known to have resided in Rome,
that city was made by tradition his see....The schism, which has left
no trace in the writings either of the Western or Eastern Church,

and presents a certain paschal canon of sixteen
years, bringing the time down to the first
year of the Emperor Alexander. Of his
other writings the following have reached

us: On the Hexacmeron," On the Works after
the Hexacmeron,'Against Marcion," On the Song

rt of by far the larger part of the Church, and the opposition of
ippolytus never amounted to more than talk, and was never strong
enough to enlist, or perhaps even attempt to enlist, the support of
Callistus and the body of the Church could afford
foreign bishops.
to leave it unnoticed; and after Callistus' death Hippolytus, un
doubtedly returned to the Church and was gladly received, and the
memory of his brief schism entirely effaced, while the knowledge of
his orthodoxy, and of his great services to the Church as a theologian
and a writer, kept his name in high repute with subsequent genera
tions. A Latin translation of a Chronicle written by Hippolytus is
extant, and the last event recorded in it is the death of the Emperor
Alexander, which took place early in the year 235. The Liberian
catalogue, in an entry which Lipsius, (Chron. }. röm. Bischö/e,
p. 194) pronounces critically indisputable, records that, in the year
235, the bishop Pontianus and the presbyter Hippolytus were trans
ported as exiles to the island of Sardinia. There is little doubt that
this is the Hippolytus with whom we are concerned, and it is highly
probable that both he and Pontianus died in the mines there, and
thus gained the title of martyrs; for not only is the account of Hip
lytus' martyrdom given by Prudentius in the fifth century not re
|. but also in the depositio martyrum of the Liberian cata
logue the bodies of Pontianus and Hippolytus are said to have been
buried in Rome on the same day; and it is therefore natural to think
that Hippolytus' body was brought from Sardinia, as we know Pon
tianus' was.
The character of Hippolytus, as revealed to us in the Philosophu
mena, is that of a ...], , even rigidly, moral man, of a puritanic dis
position, who believed in drawing the reins very tight, and allowing to
the members of the Christian Church no license. He was in this di
rectly opposed to Callistus, who was a lax disciplinarian, and favored

dence of repentance and suitable penance (see the previous chapter,
studying Hippolytus' character. He was, moreover, strictly orthodox
and bitterly opposed to what he considered the patripassianism of
Zephyrinus and of Callistus. He must be admired as a thoroughly
f. ..". and rigidly orthodox man; while at the
same time it must be recognized that he was irascible, bitter, and in
some respects narrow and bigoted. He is known to have been a
very prolific writer, composing all his works in Greek.
Eusebius
mentions but eight works in this chapter, but says that many others
were extant in his day. Jerome, who in the present instance has
other sources of information than Eusebius' History, mentions some
nineteen works (de of r. 17". c. 61), including all of those named by
Eusebius, except the commentary on portions of Ezekiel and the
work on the Events which followed the Hexa-meron (but see note 4,
below). In the year 1551, a statue representing a venerable man
sitting in a chair, and with an inscription upon it enumerating the
writings of the person commemorated, was found near the church
of San Lorenzo, just outside of Rome. The statue, though it bears
no name, has been shown to be that of Hippolytus; and with the
help of the list given upon it (which contains some thirteen works),
together with some extant fragments of writings which seem to have
been composed by him, the titles known to us have been increased
to about forty, the greater part of which are entirely lost...We cannot
discuss these works here. For the most complete list of Hippolytus'
writings the reader is referred to Caspari's sa zossymāqs is mid }.

in the Dict. of Christ. Arog.
In 1842 was discovered the greater
part of a work in ten books directed against heresies, the first book
of which had been long before published by the Benedictines among
Origen's works with the title of Phoosook u mena. This discovery
caused great discussion, but it has been proved to the complete sat
issaction of almost every scholar that it is a work of Hippolytus
(cf., among other discussions, Döllinger's Hoo'ytus und Ca' stus,
translated by Plummer, and the article in the 19tet. of Christ.
Biog, already referred to). The work was published at Oxford in
1851 by No. (who, however, wrongly ascribed it to Origen), and
at Göttingen, in 1859, o: and Schneidewin.
It is given
also by Migne; and an English translation is found in the Ante
Micene Fathers (Amer. ed.), Vol. V., under the title the Re/usa
tion of All Heresses.
* 'l'his chronological work on the passover, which contained a
cycle for the purpose of determining the date of the festival, is
mentioned also by Jerome, and is given in the list on the statue, on
which the cycle itself is also engraved. Jerome says that this work
was the occasion of Eusebius' work upon the same subject in which
a nineteen-year cycle was substituted for that of Hippolytus. The
latter was a sixteen-year cycle, and was formed by putting together
two of the eight-year cycles of the Greek astronomers, - accord
ing to whose calculation the full moon fell on the same day of the
month once in eight years, - in order to exhibit also the day of the
week on which it sell; for he noticed that after sixteen years the full
moon moved one day backward (if on Saturday at the beginning of
the cycle, it fell on Friday after the sixteen years were past). He
therefore put together seven sixteen-year cycles, assuming that
after they had passed the full moon would return again to the same

day of the week, as well as month.
This cycle is astronomically
incorrect, the fact being that aster sixteen years the full moon falls
not on the same day of the week, but three days later.
Hippolytus,
however, was not aware of this, and published his cycle in perfect
good faith. The work referred to seems to have contained an ex
planation of the cycle, together with a computation by means of it
of the dates of the Old and New Testament passovers.
It is no
longer extant, but the cycle itself, which was the chief thing, is
preserved on the statue, evidently in the form in which it was drawn
up by Hippolytus himself.

* Jerome agrees with Eusebius in mentioning a work On the Pass
over, in addition to the chronological one already referred to. The list
on the statue, however, mentions but one work on the passover, and
that the one containing the paschal cycle.
Fragments are extant of
Hippolytus' work On the Passover, - one from his '$nyma is eis, to
moorya (see Lagarde's edition of Hippolytus, p. 213), and another
from "the first book of the treatise on the holy paschal feast" (rou
Tept too dytov ráo ka ovyypáuuaros, Lagarde, p. 92). These frag
ments are of a dogmatic character, and can i.i. ave occurred in
the chronological work, except in a separate section or book; but
the last is taken from "the first book" of the treatise, and hence we
are safe in concluding that Eusebius and Jerome are correct in
enumerating two separate works upon the same subject, - the one
chronological, the other dogmatic, or polemical.

This work, Against All the Herestes, is mentioned both by
Eusebius (mpos &mdo as rās aipeosets) and Jerome (adv. on tes
Jiao reses), but is not given in #. list on the statue.
Quite a full
account of it is given from personal knowledge by Photius (Cod.
121), who calls it a small ... directed against thirty
two heresies, beginning with the Dositheans and ending with Noetus,
and say: Aat it purported to be an abstract of lectures delivered by
Irenaeus. The !. is no longer extant (it must not be confounded
with the Philosophu mena, or Refutatio, mentioned in note 1), but
it has been in part restored by Lipsius (in his Quellenkritik.des
Epiphanius) from the anti-heretical works of Pseudo-Tertullian,
Epiphanius, and Philaster. There is in existence also a fragment
of considerable length, bearing in the MS. the title Homily of Hip
§. againt the Heresy of one Asoetus.
It is o not a
homily, but the conclusion of a treatise against a number of heresics;
It was suggested by Fabricius, (who first published the original
Greek) that it constituted the closing chapter of the work against
the thirty-two heresies. The chief objection to this is that if this
fragment forms but one of o: chapters, the entire work can
hardly have been called a "little book." |. Photius.
Lipsius sug
gests that the little book of which Photius speaks was not the com
plete work of Hippolytus, but only an abbreviated summary of its
contents, and this is quite possible. At any rate it seems probable,
in spite of the objections which have been urged by some critics,
that this constituted a part of the larger work, and hence we have one
chapter of that work preserved. The work seems to have been com
Josed in Rome and during the episcopate of Victor (as Lipsius
olds), or, as is more probable, in the early part of the episcopate
of Zephyrinus (as is maintained by Harmack).
This conclusion is
drawn from the dates of the heretics mentioned in the work, some
of whom were as late as Victor, but none of them later than the
early years of Zephyrinus.
It must, too, have been composed some
years before the Philosophumena, which (in the preface) refers to
a work against heresies, written by its author "a long time before "

At that time Origen began his commen

thereto by Ambrose," who employed innumerable
incentives, not only exhorting him by word,
but also furnishing abundant means.
For
he dictated to more than seven amanuenses,
who relieved each other at appointed times. And
he employed no fewer copyists, besides girls who
were skilled in elegant writing.
For all these
Ambrose furnished the necessary expense in
abundance, manifesting himself an inexpressible
earnestness in diligence and zeal for the divine
oracles, by which he especially pressed him on
to the preparation of his commentaries.
While these things were in progress, Urba

* On Urbanus, bishop of Rome, see chap. 21, note 4.
* For the dates of the first group of Roman bishops, from Peter
to Urbanus, the best source we have is Eusebius' Church. History;
but for the second group, from Pontianus to Liberius, the notices of
the History are very unreliable, while the Liberian catalogue rests
upon very trustworthy data (see Lipsius, Chron. d: röm. Bischöfe,
p. 39 and p. 142 sq.). We must therefore turn to the latter for the
most accurate information in regard to the remaining Roman bishops
mentioned by Eusebius, although an occasional mistake in the cata
logue must be corrected by our other sources, as Lipsius points out.
The notice of Eusebius at this point would throw the accession of
Pontianus into the year 231, but this is a year too late, as seen in
coording to chap. 29, he was o six years,

According to the Felician catalogue, which
may be trusted at this point, he was brought to Rome and buried
there during the episcopate of Fabian, which began in 236 (see also

Syncellus assigns him
In the midst of such confusion we are obliged to
rely solely upon the History. The only reliable data we have are
Origen's ordination to the priesthood, which took place in 231 (see
below, p. 392) and apparently, according to this chapter, while Zebinus
was bishop of Antioch.
If Eusebius is correct in this, synchroniza
tion, Zebinus became bishop before 231, and therefore the statements
of the Chron, as to his accession may be approximately correct. As
to the time of his death, we know that his successor, Babylas, died
in the Decian persecution (see chap. 39), and hence Zebinus must
have died some years before that.
In chap. 29, Eusebius puts his
death in the reign of Gordian (238-244), and this may be accepted
as at least approximately correct, for we have reason to think that
Babylas was already bishop in the time of Philip (see chap. 29, note 8).
This proves the utter incorrectness of the notice of the Armen.
We know nothing about the person and life of Zebinus. Harmack
concludes from his name that . was a Syrian by birth. Most of the
MSS. of Eusebius give his name as Zebi vos ; one M.S. and Nicepho
rus, as Zebevos: Syncellus as Zé8evvos; Rufinus, Jerome, and the
Armen. as Zebennus.

himself and Pamphilus, which is unfortunately now lost (see above,

* Origen's commentary upon the Č. spel of John was the "first
fruits of his labors at Alexandria," as he informs us in Tom. I. § 4.
It must have been commenced, therefore, soon after he formed the
connection with Ambrose mentioned in the previous chapter, and
that it was one of the fruits of this connection is proved by the wa
in which Ambrose is addressed in the commentary itself (Tom. }.
; 3). The date at which the work was begun cannot be determined;
ut if Eusebius follows the chronological order of events, it cannot
have been before 218 (see chap. 21, note 8).

É. seen only twenty-two books), is incorrect, and that the com
mentary extended no further than the
thirteenth chapter. We

art of XIX. (printed in Lommatzsch's ed., Vols. I. and II.).
The production of this commentary marked an epoch in the
history of theological thought, and it remains in many respects
the most important of Origen's exegetical works.
It is full of
original and suggestive thought, and reveals Origen's genius per
haps in the clearest and best light, though the exegesis is everywhere
marred by the allegorizing method and by neglect of the grammatical
and historical sense.

* Of the commentary on Genesis, only some fragments from the
first and third books are extant, together with some eart racts
(ex.Aoyat), and seventeen homilies (nearly complete) in the Latin
translation of Rufinus (see Lommatzsch's ed., V.I. VIII.).
Eight of
the books, Fusebius tells us, were written in Alexandria, and they
must, of course, have been begun after the commencement of the
commentary on John. Jerome (according to Rufinus, Apol. II. 20)
gave the number of the book as thirteen (though in his catalogue
mentioned in the previous note, he speaks of fourteen), and said
that the thirteenth discussed Gen. iv. 15; and in his Contra Cel's.
VI. 49 Origen speaks of his work upon Genesis "from the beginning

of the book up to" V. 1. We may therefore conclude that the com
mentary covered only the early chapters of Genesis. The homilies,
however, discuss brief passages taken from various parts of the
book.
* Origen's writings on the Psalms comprised a complete conn
mentary (cf. Jerome's EA. ad 4 to gustin not, $20; Migne's ed.: Ep.
112), brief notes ("quod Enchi ridion ille vocabat," see Migne's
edition of Jerome's works, Vol. VIII. 821, and compare the entire
A reviarium in Psalmos which follows, and which doubtless con
tains much of Origen's work; see Smith and Wace, IV, p. 108) and
homilies.
Of these there are still extant numerous fragments in
Greek, and nine complete homilies in the Latin version of Rufinus
(printed by Lommatzsch in Vols. XI.-XIII.). The catalogue of

}: mentions forty-six books of notes on the Psalms and 118

oimilies. The commentary on the 26th and following Psalms seem to
have been written after leaving Alexandria (to judge from Eusebius'
statement here).
* There are extant some extracts (ex.Aoyat) of Origen's exposi
tions of the book of Lamentations, which are printed byf.
XIII. 167-218. They are probably from the commentary which
Eusebius tells us was written before Origen left Alexandria, and five
books of which were extant in his time. The catalogue of Jerome
also mentions five books.

* Jerome (in the catalogue and in the passage quoted by Rufinus,
AAol. II. 20) mentions two books and two dialogues on the Resur
rection (De Resurrectione libros duos. Et altos de Resurrectione
dialogos duos).
Whether the dialogues formed an independent
work we do not know. We hear of them from no other source. The
work was bitterly attacked by Methodius, but there are no traces of
heresy in the extant fragments.

° Of Origen's De Principiis (nept åpxtov), which was written
before he left Alexandria, there are still extant some fragments in
Greek, together with brief portions of a translation by Jerome (in
his epistle to Avitus; Migne's ed.: Ep. 124), and a complete but
reatly altered translation by Rufinus. The latter, together with
the extant fragments, is printed by Lommatzsch, Vol. XXI.; and
also separately by Redepenning (Lips. 1836);
Engl. trans. by
Crombie, in the Ante-Micente Fathers. The work is the most im
rtant of all Origen's writings, and from it we gather our sullest
[... as to his opinions, philosophical and theological; though
unfortunately Rufinus' alterations have made it doubtful in many
cases what Origen's original meaning was. The work constitutes
the first attempt to form a system of Christian doctrine.
It con
tains a great many peculiar, often startling errors, and was the chief
source of the attacks made upon Origen for heterodoxy; and yet
the author's object was only to set forth the doctrines accepted by
the Church, and to show how they could be systematized by the aid
of Scripture or of reason. He did not io. bring forward doc
trines inconsistent with the received faith of the Church. The
work consists of four books. To quote from Westcott: "The com
Digressions and repetitions
interfere with the symmetry of the plan.
But to speak generally,
the first book deals with God and creation (religious statics); the
second and third books with creation and providence, with man and
redemption (religious dynamics); and the fourth book with Holy
Scripture."

sition is not strictly methodical.

Intellectually the work is of a very high order, abounding in
deep and original thought as well as in grand and lofty senti
inents.

* In his catalogue, Jerome gives among the commentaries on the
Old Testament, the simple, title Stromatum, without any descrip
tion of the work. . But in his EA. ad Magnum, $ 4 (Migne's ed.,
EA. 70), he says that Qrigen wrote ten books of Stromata in imita.
tion of Clement's work, and in it compared the opinions of Chris
tians and philosophers, and confirmed the dogmas of Christianity by
appeals to Plato and other Greek philosophers (A/unc imitatus
Origines, decem scriposit Stromateas, Christianorum et philoso
Ahorum inter se sententias comparazos : et on to a nostrar re.
digion is dogmata de Platone et Aristotese, Vu mento, Corzi uto
gue confirmans).
Only three brief fragments of a Latin translation
of the work are now extant (printed in Lommatzsch's ed., XVII.
69-78). These fragments are sufficient to show us that the work
was exegetical as well as doctrinal, and discussed topics of various
kinds in the light of Scripture as well as in the light of philosophy.

Psis Review of the Canonica/Scriptures.

WHEN expounding the first Psalm," he

of the Old Testament" as follows:

l

"It should be stated that the canonical books,
as the Hebrews have handed them down, are
twenty-two; corresponding with the number of
their letters."

Farther on he says:

"The twenty-two books of the Hebrews
are the following: That which is called by
us Genesis, but by the Hebrews, from the begin
ning of the book, Bresith," which means, "In the
beginning'; Exodus, Welesmoth," that is, ‘These
are the names'; Leviticus, Wikra, "And he
called '; Numbers, Ammesphekodeim ; Deuter
onomy, Eleaddebareim, ‘These are the words';
Jesus, the son of Nave, Josoue ben Noun ;
Judges and Ruth, among them in one book,
Saphateim ; the
First and Second of Kings,
among them one, Samouel, that is, "The called of
God"; the Third and Fourth of Kings in one,
Wammelch David, that is, ‘The kingdom of
David'; of the Chronicles, the First and Sec
ond in one, Dabresamein, that is, ‘Records of
days'; Esdras," First and Second in one, Ezra,
that is, "An assistant'; the book of Psalms,
Spharthelleim; the Proverbs of Solomon, Me

tions and the epistle in one, Jeremia; Daniel,
Daniel; Ezekiel, Jezekiel ; Job, Job; Esther,
Esther. And besides these there are the Mac

He gives these in the above-mentioned work.

* On Qrigen's commentary on Psalms, see the previous chapter,
note 3. The first fragment given here by Eusebius is found also in
the Philocalia, chap. 3, where it forms part of a somewhat longer
extract.
The second fragment is extant only in this chapter of
Eusebius' History.

comparison of the words with the Hebrew titles of the books, as
we now have them, that Origen's pronunciation of Hebrew, even
after making all due allowance for a difference in the pronunciation
of the Greek and for changes in the Hebrew text, must have been, in
many respects, quite different from ours.

* Ovexecutob.

I represent the diphthong ot at the beginning of

* The first and second books of Esdras here referred to are not
the apocryphal books known by that name, but Ezra and Nehemiah,
which in the Hebrew canon formed but one book, as Origen says
here, but which in the LXX were separated (see above, Bk. III.
chap. 10, note 4).
Esdras is simply the form which the word Ezra
assumes in Greek.

* Whether this sentence closed Origen's discussion of the Hebrew
canon, or whether he went on to mention the other to books,
we cannot tell. The latter seems intrinsically much more probable,
for it is difficult to understand the insertion of the Maccabees in this
connection, and the omission of all the others: for the Maccabees,
as is clear from the words ošw & Tourwov čari Tà Maxxaflat kä, are
not reckoned by Origen among the twenty-two books as a * of
the Hebrew canon.
At the same time, it is hardly conceivable that
Eusebius should have broken off thus, in the midst of a passage, with
out any explanation; though it is, of course, not impossible that he
gives only the first sentence of the new paragraph on the books

VI. 25.]

ORIGEN ON THE SCRIPTURES.

In his first book on Matthew's Gospel,"
maintaining the Canon of the Church, he
testifies that he knows only four Gospels, writ

ing as follows:

"Among the four Gospels, which are the
only indisputable ones in the Church of God
under heaven, I have learned by tradition that
the first was written by Matthew, who was once
a publican, but afterwards an apostle of Jesus
Christ, and it was prepared for the converts
from Judaism, and published in the Hebrew
language." The second is by Mark, who
composed it according to the instructions of
Peter," who in his Catholic epistle acknowledges
him as a son, saying, ‘The church that is at
Babylon elected together with you, saluteth
you, and so doth Marcus, my son.'" And
the third by Luke, the Gospel commended
by Paul," and composed for Gentile converts.

Last of all that by John.""

In the fifth book of his Expositions of
John's Gospel, he speaks thus concerning

the epistles of the apostles: "

"But he who was ‘made sufficient to be a
minister of the New Testament, not of the let
ter, but of the Spirit," that is, Paul, who ‘fully
preached the Gospel from Jerusalem and round
Illyricum,'" did not write
about even unto
to all the churches which he had instructed ;
and to those to which he wrote he sent but
few lines." And Peter, on whom the Church
of Christ is built, ‘against which the gates
of hell shall not prevail," has left one acknowl
edged epistle; perhaps also a second, but this

the LXX, in order to show that the discussion of the Hebrew canon
closes, and a new subject is introduced at this point.
But, however
that may be, it must be regarded as certain that Origen did not
reckon the books of the Maccabees as a part of the Hebrew canon,
and on the other hand, that he did reckon those books, as well as
others o not all) of the books given in the LXX, as inspired Scrip
ture. This latter fact is ...i. his use of these books indiscrimi
nately with those of the Hebrew canon as sources for dogmatic proo
texts, and also by his express citation of at least some of them as
Scripture (cf. on this subject, Redepenning, p. 235 sq.). We must
conclude, therefore, that Origen did not adopt the Hebrew canon as
his own, but that he states it as clearly as he does in this place, in
order to bring concretely before the minds of his readers the differ
ence between the canon of the Jews and the canon of the Christians,
who looked upon the LXX as the more authoritative form of the
Old Testament.
Perhaps he had in view the same purpose that led
him to compare the Hebrew text and the LXX in his //e-rapa (see
chap. 16, note 8).

* On Origen's Commentary on Matthew, see chap. 36, note 4.
The fragment given here by Eusebius is all that is extant of the
first book of the commentary.

* Compare Origen's Hom. I. in Lucam : Ecclesia Quatuor habet
errangelia, harresea flu roma, and multi comati sunt scribere,
sed et multi contati sunt ordinare: 7uatuor tantum evange/ra sunt
Arobata, &c. Compare also Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. III. 11, 8, where
the attempt is made to show that it is impossible for the Gospels to
be either more or fewer in number than four; and the Muratorian
Fragment where the four Gospels are named, but the number four is
not represented as in itself the necessary number; also Tertullian's
Adv. Marc. IV. 2, and elsewhere.

to any specific Gospel any more than in the passages referred to
above, III. 4, note 15.

is doubtful." Why need we speak of him
who reclined upon the bosom of Jesus,"
John, who has left us one Gospel," though he
confessed that he might write so many that the
world could not contain them?" And he wrote
also the Apocalypse, but was commanded to
keep silence and not to write the words
of the seven thunders." He has left also
an epistle of very few lines; perhaps also
a second and third ; but not all consider them
genuine, and together they do not contain a
hundred lines."

In addition he makes the following state
ments in regard to the Epistle to the He
brews" in his Homilies upon it:

"That the verbal style of the epistle entitled
"To the Hebrews,' is not rude like the language of
the apostle, who acknowledged himself "rude in
speech," that is, in expression ; but that its dic
tion is purer Greek, any one who has the power
to discern differences of phraseology will ac
knowledge. Moreover, that the thoughts of
the epistle are admirable, and not inferior
to the acknowledged apostolic writings, any one
who carefully examines the apostolic text"
will admit."

Farther on he adds:

"If I gave my opinion, I should say that
the thoughts are those of the apostle, but the dic
tion and phraseology are those of some one who
remembered the apostolic teachings, and wrote
down at his leisure what had been said by his
teacher.
Therefore if any church holds that this
epistle is by Paul, let it be commended for this.
For not without reason have the ancients
handed it down as Paul's.
But who wrote
the epistle, in truth, God knows. The state
ment of some who have gone before us is that
Clement, bishop of the Romans, wrote the
epistle, and of others that Luke, the author of
But let this

* Firmilian, bishop of Caesarea, the capital of Cappadocia (to be
distinguished from , Caesarea in Palestine), was one of the most
famous prelates of his day in the Eastern Church. He was a friend
of Origen, as we learn from the next chapter, and took part in a
council called on account of the schism of Novatian (see chap. 46),
and also in councils called to consider the case of Paul of Samosata
(see Bk. VII. chaps. 28 and 30). He was one of the bishops whom
Stephen excommunicated because they rebaptized heretics (see Bk
No. chap. 2, note 3, and chap. 5, note 4), and he wrote an epistle
upon this subject to Cyprian, which is extant in a Latin transla:
tion made by Cyprian }.} (EA. 74, al. 75, in the collection of
Cyprian's epistles.
Basil
(afe SAfrit to Sancto, 29) refers to works (A6)ot) left by Firmilian,
but none of them are extant except the single epistle mentioned,
nor do we hear from any other source that he was a writer. Jerome
does not mention him in his De vir. Fol. The exact date of his
accession is unknown to us, as it very likely was to Eusebius also.
He was a bishop already in the tenth year of Alexander (231 A.D.),
or very soon afterward, and from Bk. VII. chap. 3o, we learn that
he died at Tarsus on his way to Antioch to attend a council which
had been summoned to deal with Paul of Samosata.
This synod
was held about 265 A.D. (not in 272 as is commonly supposed; see
Bk. VII. chap. 29, note 1), and it is at this time, therefore, that we
must put the death of Firmilian; so that he was bishop of Caesarea
at least some thirty-four years.

* Alexander Severus was murdered early in the year 235, and was
succeeded at once by his commanding general, the Thracian, Maxi
minus, or Caius Julius Verus Maximinus, as he called himself.

* The reference here is not to the immediate family of Alexander,
but to the court as a whole, his family in the widest sense, including
court officials, servants, &c.
The favor which Alexander had
shown to the Christians (see chap. 21, note 8) is clearly seen in
the fact that there were so many Christians, at court, as Eusebius
informs us here.
This persecution was at first directed, Eusebius
tells us, solely against the heads of the churches (rous row oxxAmo tow
apxortas), i.e. the bishops; and we might imagine only those bishops
who had stood nearest Alexander and had been most favored by him
to be meant (Pontianus and Hippolytus of Rome were exiled, for
instance, at the very beginning o Koi...' reign, in the year 235;
see chap. 22, note 1); for Maximinus' hostility to the Christians seems
to have been caused, not by religious motives, but by mere hatred of
his predecessor, and of every cause to which he had shown favor. But
the persecution was not confined to such persons, as we learn from
this chapter, which tells us of the sufferings of Ambrose and Protoc
tetus, neither of whom was a bishop.
It seems probable that most of
the persecuting was not the result of positive efforts on the part of
Maximinus, but rather of the superstitious hatred of the common
people, whose fears had been recently aroused by earthquakes and
who always attributed such calamities to the existence of the Chris
tians. Of course under Maximinus they had free rein, and could
persecute whenever, they or the provincial authorities felt inclined
(cf. Firmilian's epistle to Cyprian, and Origen's Erhort, ad Mart.).
Eusebius tells us nothing *:::::::::: whereabouts at this time; but
in Palladius' Hist. Laros. 147, it is said that Origen was given refuge
by Juliana in Caesarea in Cappadocia during some persecution, un
doubtedly this one, if the report is true (see chap. 17, note 4).

had assembled to select by vote him who
should succeed to the episcopate of the church,

the minds of many, but Fabianus, although pres

But they relate
that suddenly a dove flying down lighted on his
head, resembling the descent of the Holy Spirit
on the Saviour in the form of a dove.

unanimity cried out that he was worthy, and

(both here and in the Chron.) the direct successor of Maximinus,
simply because only two or three months elapsed between the death
of the latter and his own accession.

* Both here and in the Chron. the accession of Anteros is syn
chronized with the accession of Gordianus, but as seen in chap. 23,
note 3, Pontianus was succeeded by Anteros in the first year of
Maximinus, i.e. in 235, - three years earlier, therefore, than the
date given by Eusebius.
All the authorities agree in assigning only
one month and a few days to the episcopate of Anteros, and this is to be

he gives for the accession of these three bishops, and the statements
of the Liberian catalogue are to be ... which put Fabian's
accession in W. 236, and his death in January, 250, after an
episcopate of fourteen years and ten days. The martyrdom of
Fabian rests upon good authority (cf. chap. 39, and Jerome's de
for. o. chap. 54, and especially Cyprian's Epist.'es, 3, a 2. 9, and
39). From these epistles we learn that he was a man o ability and
virtue. He stands out more clearly in the light of history than most
of the early Roman bishops, but tradition has handed down a great
many unfounded stories in regard to him (see the article in the Dict.
of C4 rest. Bros.).

There are
extant the Acta BaAylae ("purious), which, however, confound him
with a martyr who suffered under Numerian. The legends in re
gard to Babylas and to the miracles performed by his bones are very
numerous (see Tillemont, ".c.). He is identified by Chrysostom and
others with the bishop mentioned by Eusebius in chap. 34, and there
is no good reason to doubt the identification (see Harmack, Zeit des
£o p. 48). The fact of his martyrdom under Decius (see
chap. 39) is too well attested to admit of doubt: though upon the
manner of it, not all the traditions are agreed, Eusebius reporting
that he died in prison, Chrysostom that he died by violence. The
account of E".'. seems the most reliable. The date of his acces

during the reign of Gordian (238-244), as Eusebius here seems to

of Demetrius, which certainly took place not later than 232 (see

CHAPTER XXX.

The Pupils of Origen.

WHILE Origen was carrying on his customary
duties in Caesarea, many pupils came to him not
only from the vicinity, but also from other coun
tries. Among these Theodorus, the same that
was distinguished among the bishops of our
day under the name of Gregory,' and his brother

the accession of Babylas back so far as that.

1 our sources for a knowledge of the life of Gregory, who is
known as Gregory Thaumaturgus ("wonder-worker"), are numer
ous, but not all of them reliable. He is mentioned by Eusebius here
and in Bk. VII. chaps. 14 and 28, and a brief account of his life
and writings is given by Jerome (de vir. ill. chap. 65), who adds
some particulars not mentioned by Eusebius. There is also extant
Gregory's Panegyrica.' Oration in praise of Origen, which contains
an outline of the earlier years of his life. Gregory of Nyssa about
a century later wrote a life of Gregory Thaumaturgus, which is still
extant, but which is full of marvelous stories, and contains little that
Gregory's same was very great among his contem
is trustworthy.
raries and succeeding generations, and many of the Fathers have
eft brief accounts of him, or references to him which it is not neces
sary to mention here. He was a native of Neo-Caesarea in Pontus
(according to Gregory Nyssa), the same city of which he was after
ward bishop, was of wealthy parentage, and began the study of law
when quite young (see his own Orat. Paneg. chap. 5). Coming to
Caesarea, in Palestine, on his way to Berytus, where he and his
brother Athenodorus were to attend a school of law, he met Origen,
and was so attracted by him that he and his brother remained in
Caesarea five years (according to Eusebius and Jerome) and studied
logic, physics, mathematics, ethics, Greek philosophy, and theology
with him (see his Orat.).
At the end of this time the brothers
returned to Pontus, and afterwards were made bishops, Gregory of
Neo-Caesarea, his native place; Athenodorus of some unknown city
(Eusebius here and in VII. 14 and 28 says only that they were both
bishops of churches in Pontus). Of the remarkable events connected
with the ordination of Gregory, which are told by Gregory of Nyssa,
it is not necessary to speak here. He was a prominent scholar and
writer, and a man universally beloved and respected for his deep
piety and his commanding it. but his fame rested chiefly upon
the reports of his miracle-working, which were widespread. The
prodigies told of him are numerous and marvelous.
Eusebius is
silent about this side of his career (whether because of ignorance or
incredulity we cannot tell, but the latter seems most probable), but
Jerome refers to his fame as a miracle-worker, Gregory of Nyssa's
I ita, is full of it, and Basil and other later writers dwell upon it.
What the foundation for all these traditions was we do not know.
He was a famous missionary, and seems to have been remarkably
successful in converting the pagans of his diocese, which was almost
wholly heathen when i. became bishop.
This great missionary
success may have given rise to the tales of supernatural power, some
cause above the ordinary being assumed by the common people as
necessary to account for such results.
Miracles and other super
natural phenomena were quite commonly assumed in those days
as causes of conversions - especially if the conversions themselves
were in any way remarkable (cf. e.g. the close of the anonymous
//talogue with //croan us, a Jew). Not only the miracles, but also
many other events reported in Gregory of Nyssa's l'ita, must be
regarded as unfounded; e.g. the account of a long period of study in
Alexandria of which our more reliable sources contain no trace.
The veneration in which Gregory held Origen is clear enough from
his panegyric, and the great regard which Origen cherished for
Gregory is revealed in his epistle to the latter, written soon after
Gregory's arrival in Neo-Caesarea, and still preserved in the Philo
ca/a, chap. 13. The works of Gregory known to us are his Pane
gyrical Oration in praise of Origen, delivered in the presence of
the latter and of a great multitude before Gregory's departure from
Caesarea, and still extant; a paraphrase of the book of Ecclesiastes,
mentioned by Jerome (s.c.), and likewise extant; several epistles
referred to by Jerome (1.c.), only one of which, his so-galled Canon:
cal Epistle, addressed to an anonymous bishop of Pontus, is still
preserved; and finally a trinitarian creed, or confession of faith,

Finding them deeply interested in
Greek and Roman learning, he infused into them
a love of philosophy, and led them to exchange
their old zeal for the study of divinity. Remain

Africanus.

l

At this time also Africanus,' the writer of
* the books entitled Cesti, was well known.

which is given by Gregory of Nyssa in his Pita, and whose genu
ineness has been warmly disputed (e.g. by Lardner, Works, 11.
p. 634 sq.); but since Caspari's defense of it in his Gesch. d. Tauf
symbols und der Glaubensregel, its authenticity may be regarded
as established.
These four writings, together with some works
falsely ascribed to Gregory, are translated in The Ante-Micene
Pathers, Am. ed., Vol. §: p. 1-80.

Patr. Gr. X. 983-1343.

Syriac writings of Gregory, one on the equality of Father, Son, and
Spirit, and the other on the passibility and impassibility of God.
Gregory's dates cannot be fixed with exactness; but as 3. Cannot

when he met him there, he must have been born as late as the secon
decade of the third century. As he was with Origen at least five
years, he can hardly have taken his farewell of him until after the
persecution of Maximinus (i.e., after 238), for we cannot suppose
that he pronounced his panegyrical oration during that persecution.
He speaks in the first chapter of that oration of not having delivered
an oration for eight years, and this is commonly supposed to imply
that it was eight years since he had begun to study with Origen, in
which case the oration must be put as late as 239, and it must be
assumed, if Eusebius' five years are accepted as accurate, that he
was absent for some three years during that period (perhaps while

F. been reckoned from an earlier time, perhaps from the time
when he began the study of law, which was before he met Origin
(see Panegyr. chaps. I and 5).
If we were to suppose the order
followed by Eusebius strictly chronological, we should have to put
Gregory's acquaintance with Origen into the reign of Gordian (238-
`ih, truth is, the matter cannot be decided. He is said by
244).
Gregory of Nyssa to have retired into concealment during the perse
cution of Decius, and to have returned to his charge again after its
close. He was present with his brother Athenodorus at one of the
councils called to consider the case of Paul of Samosata (see Bk.
VII. chap. 28), but was not present at the final one at which Paul
was condemned (see ord, chaps. 29 and 30, and note 2 on the latter
chapter). This one was held about 265 (see food, chap. 29, note 1),
and hence it is likely that Gregory was dead before that date.
* Athenodorus is known to us only as the brother of Gregory and
bishop of some church or churches in Pontus (see Bk. Wii. 3.
14 and 28).
1 Julius Africanus o: he is called by Jerome) was one of the
most learned men of the Ante-Nicene age. Not much is known of
his life, though he seems to have resided, at least for a time, in Em
maus, a town of Palestine, something over twenty miles from Jerusa
len (not the Emmaus of Luke xxiv. 13, . was but seven or
eight miles from the city), for we hear in the Chron., and in Jerome's
de tor. o. c. 63, of his *: on an embassy to the Emperor Helio
gabalus, and securing the rebuilding of the ruined city Emmaus
under the name of Nicopolis, which it henceforth bore. He does
not appear to have been a clergyman, or at any rate not a bishop;
for he is spoken of as such by no early authority, and he is addressed
by Origen in an extant epistle, which must have been written toward

man when he went on an embassy to the emperor (between 218 and

he was still alive and active in the time of Gordian (238-244); But
if he was enough older than Origen to address him as "son," he can
hardly have lived much beyond that reign. He seems to have been
a Christian philosopher and scholar rather than an ecclesiastic, and
took no such part in the church affairs of the time as to leave men

quite a traveler, as we learn from his own writings, and had the
well-deserved reputation of being one of the greatest scholars of the
age.
Eusebius mentions four works left by him, the Cestr, the
Chronicon, and the epistles to Origen and to Aristides, Jerome
(?.c.) mentions only the last three, but Photius (Cod. 34) refers to

nine books: Photius mentions fourteen, Suidas twenty-four.
It is
no longer extant, but numerous scattered fragments have been pre
served.
Its authenticity has been doubted, chiefly because of its
purely secular character, and the nature of some of the notes, which
do not seem worthy of the clear-headed and at the same time Chris
tian scholar.
But the external evidence, which is not unsupported
by the internal, is too strong to be set aside, and we must conclude
that the work is genuine.
The extant fragments of it are given
in various works on mathematics, agriculture, etc. (see Richard
son's Bibliographica? Synopsis, p. 68). The epistle of Africanus
to Origen is the only one of his writings preserved in a complete
form.
It seems that Origen, in a discussion with a certain Bas
sus (see Origen's epistle to Africanus, $ 2), at which Africanus
was present, had quoted from that part of the Book of Daniel which
contains the apocryphal story of Susannah.
Africanus afterward
wrote a brief epistle to Origen, in which he contended that the story
is not authentic, urging among other arguments differences in style
between it and the rest of the book, and the fact that the story is not
found in Hebrew, and that certain phrases show that it was com
posed originally in Greek.
Origen replied at considerable length,
maintaining the authenticity of the passage, and thereby showing
himself inferior to Africanus in critical judgment.
Origen's repl
was written from Nicomedia (see § 1), where, he was staying wit

was made on his way to or from his second visit to Athens (see next
chapter, note 4).
Africanus' greatest work, and the one which
brought him most fame, was his Chronicon, in five books. The
work is no longer extant, but considerable fragments of it have
been preserved (e.g. in Eusebius' Pra-A. Errang. X. Io, and Dern.
Ezang. VIII., and especially in the Chronographra of Syncel
lus), and the Chronicon of Eusebius which is really based upon it, so
that we are enabled to gain a very fair idea of its original form. As de
scribed by Photius, it was concise, but omitted nothing worthy of men
tion, beginning with the creation and coming down to the reign of
Macrinus.
It actually extended to the fourth year of Heliogabalus
(221), as we see from a quotation made by Syncellus. The work seems
to have been caused by the common desire of the Christians (exhibited
by Tatian, Clement of Alexander, and others) to prove in their de
sense of Christianity the antiquity of the H. religion, and thus
take away the accusation of novelty brought against Christianity by
Africanus apparently aimed to produce a universal

chronicle and history, which .. exhibit, the synchronism of
events in the history of the leading nations of the world, and thus
furnish solid ground for Christian apologists to build upon.
It was
the first attempt of the kind, and became the foundation of Christian
chronicles for many centuries. The time at which it was written is
determined with sufficient accuracy by the date at which the chron
ological table closes., Salmon (in the Pict. of Christ. Biog.)
remarks that it must have been completed early in the year 221, for
it did not contain the names of the victors in o Olympic games of
the 25oth Olympiad, which took place in that year (as we learn
from the list of victors copied by Eusebius from Africanus).
It is
said by Eusebius, just below, that Africanus reports in this work
that he had visited Alexandria on account of the great celebrity of
Heraclas.
This is very surprising, for we should hardly have ex
pected Heraclas' fame to have attracted such a man to Alexandria
until after Origen had left, and he had himself become the head of
the school. On the fourth writing mentioned by Eusebius, the
epistle to Aristides, see above, Bk. I. chap. 7, note 2. The frag

There is extant also
another epistle from the same Africanus to
Aristides on the supposed discrepancy between
Matthew and Luke in the Genealogies of Christ.
In this he shows clearly the agreement of the

down to him, which we have already given in

* In Bk. I. chap. 7.
1 "About this time" refers us still to the reign of Gordian (238244).
Eusebius mentions only the commentaries on Isaiah, but
Jerome refers also to homilies and notes. The thirty books which
were extant in Eusebius' time extended to XXX. 6, as we are in
formed here.
Whether the commentary originally went beyond
this point we do not know. There are extant only two brief Latin
fragments from the first, and eighth books of the commentary, and
nine homilies (the last incomplete) in a Latin version by Jerome;
printed by Lommatzsch, § 235-301.

2 Eusebius records that Origen wrote only twenty-five books of
a commentary on Ezekiel. The form of expression would seem to
imply that these did not cover the whole of Ezekiel, but a fragment
of the twentieth book, extant in the eleventh chapter of the Philo
calia, deals with the thirty-fourth chapter of the prophecy, so that
the twenty-five books must have covered at any rate most of the
ground. The catalogue of Jerome mentions twenty-nine books and
twelve homilies, but the former number must be a mistake, for
Eusebius' explicit statement that Origen wrote but twenty-five books
can hardly be doubted. There are extant only the Greek fragment
of the twentieth book referred to above, fourteen homilies in the
Latin version of Jerome, and a few extracts; all printed by Lom
matzsch, XIV. 1-232.

3 i.e. to Isa. xxx. 6, where the LXX reads n 6paarts tow terpa
Tööwy row v Tim opnute, which are the exact words used by Eusebius.
Our English versions, both the authorized and revised, read, "The
burden of the beasts of the South." The Hebrew will bear either
rendering.

* The cause of this second visit to Athens we do not know, nor
the date of it; although if Eusebius is to be relied upon, it took place
during the reign of Gordian (238-244). He must have remained
some time in Athens and have had leisure for study, for he finished
his commentary on Ezekiel and wrote five books of his commentary
on Canticles. This visit to Athens is to be distinguished from the
one referred to in chap. 23, because it is probable that Origen found
the Nicopolis copy of the Old Testament (mentioned in chap. 16)
on the occasion of a visit to Achaia, and this visit is pool, too
late, for he seems to have finished his He-ražla before this time;
and still further, the epistle in which he refers to spurious accounts
of his disputation at Athens (see Jerome's Apol. adz". Ruf. II. 18),
complains also of Demetrius and of his own excommunication, which,
as Redepenning remarks, points to a date soon after that excommuni
cation took place, and not a number of years later, when Demetrius
had becr long dead.

* From the seventh chapter of the Philocalia we learn that Ori
gen, in his youth, wrote a small book (uukpos Touds) upon Canticles,
of which a single brief fragment is preserved in that chapter. The
catalogue of j. mentions ten books, two books written early,
and two homilies.
Eusebius mentions onl
the commentary, of
which, he says, five books were written in Athens, and five more in
Caesarea. The prologue and four books are extant in a Latin trans
lation by Rufinus, and two homilies in a translation by Jerome; be

and that he does not possess a divinity of his
own," but only that of the Father dwelling
in him. Many bishops carried on investigations and discussions with him on this
matter, and Origen having been invited with the
others, went down at first for a conference with
him to ascertain his real opinion.
But when he
understood his views, and perceived that they
were erroneous, having persuaded him by argu
ment, and convinced him by demonstration, he
brought him back to the true doctrine, and re

On Eusebius'

1 Beryllus, bishop of Bostra in Arabia (mentioned above, in chap.
20), is chiefly noted on account of the heresy into which he sell, and
from which Origen won him back, by convincing him of his error.
According to chap. 20, he was a learned and cultured man, and
{. (de zor. ill. c. 60) says of him, gloriose re-risset ecclesiam.
We do not know his dates, but we may gather from this chapter that
the synod which was called on his account convened during the
reign of Gordian (238-244), and apparently toward the close of the
reign. Our sources for a knowledge of the heresy of Beryllus are very
meager. We have only the brief passage in this chapter; a fragment
of Origen's commentary on Titus (Lommatzsch, V. 287), which un
doubtedly refers to Beryllus' error, though he is not mentioned by
name; and finally, a single sentence in Jerome's de zor. 17. c. 6o
(Christ to me ante incarnationem regat), which, however, is appar
ently no more than his own interpretation of Eusebius' words. Our
sources have been interpreted very differently, some holding Beryl
lus to have been a Patripassian, others classing him with the Arte
monites (see above, Bk. V. chap. 28). He was, at any rate, a
Monarchian, and his position, not to enter here into details, seems
to have been that our Lord did not pre-exist as an independent be
ing; but that, with the incarnation, he, who had previously been
identified with the marpaxm 6eórms, became a distinct being, pos
sessed of an independent existence
(see Dorner's Person of
Christ, Div. I. Vol. II. p. 35 sq., Edinburgh colition). According
to this chapter and chap. zo, Beryllus was the author of numerous
treatises and epistles, which were extant in Eusebius' time. Ac

cording to Jerome (Z.c.), he wrote, varia .. et ma.rime
of stolas, in 77, ičius Orogeni gratias agit. Jerome reports, also,
that there were extant in his time epistles of Origen, addrossed to
o: and a dialogue between Origen and Beryllus.

of these epistles and other works have perished.

* The younger Gordian reigned from the summer of 238 until
early in the year 244, when he was murdered by the soldiers, and
succeeded by his praetorian prefect, Philip of Arabia, who took the
name Marcus Julius Philippus, and reigned until 249, when he was
conquered and succeeded by Decius. His son Philip, who was seven
years old at the time of his father's accession, was immediately pro
claimed Caesar and afterward given the title of Augustus. He bore
the name Marcus Julius Philippus Severus, and was slain at the
time of his father's death.

* There has been much dispute as to Philip's relation to Christi
anity.
Eusebius is the first one known to us to represent him as a
Christian, and he gives the report only upon the authority of oral
tradition (roorov Karéxei A6).os Xpta travov on to ). Jerome (de for.
zoo. 54) states explicitly that Philip was the first Christian emperor
(7:, ; Arim as de ... Romani's christian us /u.fr), and this be
came common tradition in the Church.
At the same time it must
be noticed that Eusebius does not himself state that Philip was a
Christian, -he simply records a tradition to that effect; and in his
lota Const. I. 3 he calls Constantine the first Christian emperor.
Little reliance can be placed upon Jerome's explicit statement, for
he seems only to be repeating as certain what Eusebius reported as
ossible. The only things known to us which can or could have
!. urged in support of the alleged fact that Philip was a Christian
are his act recorded in this chapter and the letter written to him by

avorable to Christianity, and perhaps superstitiously desired to gain
the favor of the Christians' God, and hence went through some such
process as Eusebius describes in this chapter, looking upon it mercly
as a sort of sacrifice to be offered to this God as he would offer other
sacrifices to other gods.
It is quite conceivable that he may have
done this much, and this would be quite enough to start the report,
after his death, that he had been a Christian secretly, if not openly:

O/her IWorks of Origen.

At this time, as the faith extended and our
doctrine was proclaimed boldly before all,'
Origen, being, as they say, over sixty years old,"
and having gained great facility by his long prac
tice, very properly permitted his public discourses
to be taken down by stenographers, a thing
which he had never before allowed. He
also at this time composed a work of eight
books in answer to that entitled True Discourse,
which had been written against us by Celsus "

able in the identification, which may therefore be looked upon as

That is, the place assigned to penitents: u eravot as xeopar.
Christians who had committed flagrant transgressions were excluded
from communion and required to go through a course of penance,
more or less severe according to their offense, before they could be
received again into the Church.
In some cases they were excluded
entirely from the services for a certain length of time; in other cases
they were allowed to attend a part of the services, but in no case
could they partake of the communion.
In the fourth century a
regular system of discipline grew up, and the penitents (farmi
feates) were divided into various classes, - mourners, hearers, and
kncelers; the first of whom were excluded cntirely from the church,
while the last two were admitted during a part of the service. The
statement in the present case is of the most general character.
Whether the place which he was obliged to take was without or
within the church is not indicated. Upon the whole subject of an
cicnt church discipline, see Bingham's Antoyu stres, Bk. XVI., and
the article Penitence in Smith's /)ict. of Christian Antio.

1 On Heraclas, see chap. 3, note 2. The third year of Philip's
reign extended from the summer of 246 to the summer of 247, so that
if Heraclas became bishop in 232, he cannot have held office fully
sixteen years. The agreement, however, is so close as to occasion
no difficulty.

* Of the personal history of Celsus, the first great literary oppo
nent of Christianity, we know nothing with certainty, nor did Origen
know any more. He had heard that there were two persons of the
same name, the one living in the time of Nero, the other, whom he
identifics with his opponent, in the time of Hadrian and later, and
both of them Epicurean philosophers (see contra Cess. I. 8). The
work of Celsus, however, was clearly the work, not of an Epicurean,
but of a Platonist, or at least of an eclectic philosopher, with a stron
leaning toward Platonism. The author wrote about the middle o
the second century, probably in the reign of Marcus Aurelius (Keim
fixes the date of the work at 178 A.D.). The True Discourse
(à Anons Agyos) is no longer extant, but, it can be reconstructed in

the Epicurean, and the twenty-five books on
the Gospel of Matthew," besides those on the
Twelve Prophets, of which we have found
only twenty-five." There is extant also an

another to Severa his wife, with several others
to different persons. We have arranged in dis

the ablest and most philosophical attacks of ancient times, and to
have anticipated a great many arguments urged against Christianity
by modern unbelievers.
Celsus, was well acquainted with Chris
tianity in its various forms and with its literature, and he set himself to
work with all his learning and skill to compose a complete relu.a.ion
of the whole thing. . He writes apparently less from a religious than
from a political motive. He was an ardent patriot, and considered
paganism essential to the life of the State, and Christianity its neces.
sary antagonist. He undertakes first to show that Christianity is
historically untenable, and then that it is false from the standpoint
of philosophy and ethics.
It is noticeable that it is not his desire to
exterminate Christianity completely, but to make peace with it; to
induce the Christians to give up their claim to possess the only true
religion, and, with all their high ethics and lofty ideals, to join 3.
with the upholders of the ancient religion in o the religious
ideas of the people, and thus benefiting the state.
hen we look
at his work in this light (and much misunderstanding has been caused
by a failure to do this), we must admire his ability, and respect his
motives. He was, however, by no means free from the superstitions
and prejudices of his age. The most important book upon the work
of Celsus is Keim's Celsus' Wahres IVort, Zürich, 1873, which
reconstructs, from Origen's reply, Celsus' work, and translates and
explains it.
Origen's reply is philosophical and in parts very able,
but it must be acknowledged that in many places he does not suc'
ceed in answering his opponent. His honesty, however, must be
admired in letting his adversary always speak for himself. He at
tempts to answer every argument urged by Celsus, and gives the
argument usually in Celsus' own words. The result is that the work
is quite desultory in its treatment, and often weighted with unimpor
tant details and tiresome repetitions. At the same time, it is full of
rich and suggestive thought, well worthy of Origen's genius, and
shows a deepo of the true spiritual nature of Christianity.
The entire work of eight books is extant in the original Greek, and
is printed in all editions of Origen's works (Lommatzsch, Vol. XX.
W. 1-226), and is translated in the Ante-Vicene Fathers, Am. ed.
It was one of Origen's latest works, as we are told
here by Eusebius, and was composed (as we learn from its preface)
at the urgent request of Ambrose, to whom also it was dedicated.

ol. IV. 395-669.

* The commentary on Matthew was written toward the close of
Origen's life, as Eusebius informs us here, a fact which is confirmed
by references in the work itself to many of his earlier commentaries.
There are extant a single fragment from the first book (quoted in
chap. 25, above), one from the second book (quoted in the Philo
calia, chap. 6), and Books X.-XVII. entire in the original Greek,
There are also extant numerous

notes, which may have been tion, some of them from the commen
tary, and others from the homilies; and a Latin version of the com
mentary covering Matt. xvi. 13-xxvii.
(See Lommatzsch, Vols.
III.-V.). The catalogue of Jerome mentions twenty-five books
and twenty-five homilies, and in the preface to his commentary on
Matthew, Jerome states that he had read the twenty-five books, but
elsewhere (in the prologue to his translation of Origen's homilies on
Luke; Migne, o 219) he speaks of thirty-six (or twenty-six)
books of the commentary, but this is doubtless a mistake (and so
Vallarsi reads vigirit; quinque in the text). There is no reason to
think that Origen wrote more than twenty-five books, which must
have covered the whole Gospel (to judge from the portions extant).
The books which are preserved contain much that is interesting and
suggestive.

* Jerome also mentions twenty-five books upon the twelve proph
ets (in duodeoint Prophetas onto quinque, onymoeov. Origents
wo/n ortina), of which he had found a copy in the library of Caesarea,
transcribed by the hand of Pamphilus (de zor. o. 75). The cata
logue of Jerome enumerates two books on Hosea, two on Joel, six
on Amos, one on Jonah, two on Micah, two on Mahum, three on
Habakkuk, two on Zephaniah, one on Haggai, two on Zechariah,
two on Malachi; but in the preface to his commentary on Malachi,
Jerome mentions three books on that prophecy. Of all these books
only one sragment of the commentary on Hosea is extant, being
preserved in the Philoca/ia, c. 8.

* These epistles, to Philip and his wife Severa are no longer
extant, nor can we form an accurate idea of their contents. We are
reminded of Origen's interview with Mammaea, the mother of Alex

view of the silence of Eusebius.
It is possible that the favor shown

might be won for the faith, and there is nothing surprising in his
addressing epistles to them with this idea. On Éi. relations to

of the Apology" which we have written in his
behalf. .

CHAPTER XXXVII.

The Dissension of the Arabians."

ABOUT the same time others arose in Arabia,
putting forward a doctrine foreign to the truth.
They said that during the present time the human
soul dies and perishes with the body, but that
at the time of the resurrection they will be
renewed together.
And at that time also a
synod of considerable size assembled, and Ori
gen, being again invited thither, spoke publicly
on the question with such effect that the opin
ions of those who had formerly fallen were
changed.

* This collection of Origen's epistles made by Eusebius is no
longer extant. The catalogue of Jerome mentions "eleven books of
letters in all; two books in defense of his works." Only two epistles
are preserved entire, - the one to Julius Africanus (see chap. 31,
note 1); the other to Gregory Thaumaturgus, written, apparently,
soon after the departure of §e latter from Caesarea (sce chap. 39,
note 1), for Gregory was, at the time it was written, still undecided
as to the profession which he should follow.
In addition to these
two complete epistles, there are extant a sentence from a letter to
his father (quoted in chap. 2); also a fragment of an epistle to some
unknown person, describing the great zeal of his friend Ambrose
(see chap. 18, note 1. The fragment is preserved by Suidas s. v.
'Qptyevns); also a fragment defending his study of heathen philoso
phy (quoted in chap. 19, above); and two fragments in Latin, from
a letter addressed to some Alexandrian friends, complaining of the
alterations made by certain persons in the reports of disputations
which he had held with them (see chap. 32, note 4. The one frag
ment is preserved by Jerome, in his Apos. adv. Rzes. II. 18; the
other by Rufinus, in his apology for Origen). Of his epistles to
Fabian and others no trace remains.

* On Fabian, sce chap. 29, note 4. We do not know when this
letter to Fabian was written; but it cannot have been written in
consequence of Origen's condemnation by the Alexandrian Synods
called by Demetrius, for they were held in 231 or 232, and Fabian
did not become bishop until 236.
There must have been some later
cause, - perhaps a condemnation by a later synod of Alexandria,
perhaps only the prevalence of a report that Origen was heterodox,
which was causing serious suspicions in Rome and elsewhere. We
know that the controversies which raged so fiercely about his mem
ory began even before his death.

° On this 19efense, see above, p. 36.
1 The exact nature of the heresy which is here described by
It is disputed whether
Eusebius is somewhat difficult to determine.
these heretics are to
reckoned with the 6v mToroux, Tat (whom
John of Damascus mentions in his de //arres. c. 99, and to whom
Augustine refers, under the name of Aračići, in his de Harres,
c. 83), that is, those who taught the death of the soul with the body,
or with the involvviral, who taught that the soul slept between the
Redepenning, in a very
death and the resurrection of the body.
thorough discussion of the matter (II. Ios sq.), concludes that the
heresy to which Eusebius refers grew up under Jewish influence,
which was very strong in Arabia, and that it did not teach the death
(as Eusebius asserts), but only the slumber of the soul. He reckons
them therefore with the second, not the first, class mentioned.
But
it seems to me that Redepenning is almost hypercritical in main
taining that it is impossible that these heretics can have taught
that the soul died and afterward was raised again; for it is no more
impossible that they should have taught it than that Eusebius and
others should have supposed that they did.
In fact, there does not
seem to be adequate ground for correcting Eusebius' statement,
which describes heretics who must distinctly be classed with the
8wn roma vy rat mentioned later by John of Damascus. We do not
know the date at which the synod referred to in this chapter was
held. We only know that it was subsequent to the one which dealt
with Beryllus, and therefore it must have been toward the close of
Philip's reign.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

The Heresy of the E/kesites.

ANOTHER error also arose at this time, called
the heresy of the Elkesites,' which was extin
guished in the very beginning.
Origen speaks
of it in this manner in a public homily on the
eighty-second Psalm : *

"A certain man" came just now, puffed up
greatly with his own ability, proclaiming that
godless and impious opinion which has appeared
lately in the churches, styled ‘of the Elkesites.'
I will show you what evil things that opinion
teaches, that you may not be carried away by
it.
It rejects certain parts of every scripture.
Again it uses portions of the Old Testament and
the Gospel, but rejects the apostle ‘ altogether.
It says that to deny Christ is an indifferent mat
ter, and that he who understands will, under
necessity, deny with his mouth, but not in his

1 The Elkesites ("EAxeo attai) were not a distinct sect, but "a
school scattered among all parties of the Judaeo-Christian Church."
They are described by o: (Phil. IX. 8-12) and by Epipha
nius (in chap. 19 among the Esseno, in 30 among the Ebionites,
and in 53 among the Sampsaeans). We learn from o that,
in the time of Callistus or soon afterward, a certain Alcibiades, a na
tive of Apameia in Syria, brought to Rome a book bearing the name
of Ekesai ('HAxagat), which o to contain a revelation,
made in the time of Trajan, by the Son of God and the Holy Spirit
in the form of angels, and teaching the forgiveness of all sins, even
the grossest, by means of belief in the doctrines of the book and
baptism performed with certain peculiar rites. The controversy in
regard to the forgiveness of gross sins committed after baptism was
raging high at this time in Rome, and Hippolytus, who took the
strict side, naturally opposed this new system of indulgence with
the greatest vigor. Among other doctrines taught in the book, was
the lawfulness of denying the faith in time of persecution, as told us
by Origen in this chapter, and by Epiphanius in chap. 19. The
book was strongly Ebionitic in its teaching, and bore striking resem
Its exact
blances to the Clementine Homilies and Recognitions.
relation to those writings has been disputed; but Uhlhorn (Homilient
und Recognition.cn des Clemens Romanus) has shown conclu
sively that it is older than the latter, and that it represents a type of
Ebionitic Christianity less modified than the latter by the influence
of Christianity.
In agreement with the Ebionites, the Elkesites (as
all those were called who accepted the teachings of the book, to
whatever party they might belong) taught that Christ was a created
being; and they also repudiated sacrifices, which compelled them to
reject certain portions of the Old Testament (cf. Origen's statement
just below). . They likewise refused recognition to the apostle Paul,
and ordained the observance of the Jewish law; but they went be
yond the Clementines in teaching the necessity of circumcision and
the repetition of baptism as a means to the forgiveness of sins. The
origin of the name Eocsai has also been disputed. Hippolytus says
it was the name of the man who was claimed to have received §.
revelation, and Epiphanius calls Elkesai a false prophet; but some
critics have thought them mistaken, and have supposed that Elkesai
must have been the name of the book, or of the angel that gave the
revelation.
It is more probable, however, as Salmon concludes, that
it was the name of a man whom the book represented as receiving the
revelation, but that the man was only an imaginary person, and not
the real founder of the school, as Epiphanius supposed. The book
cannot well be put back of the beginning of the |. ccntury, when
it first began to be heard of in the Catholic Church.
It claimed to
have been for a century in secret circulation, but the claim is quite
unfounded.
Eusebius speaks of the heresy as extinguished in the
very beginning, and it seems, in fact, to have played no prominent
part in history; and yet it apparently lingered on for a long time in
the East, for we hear of a sect in Arabia, as late as the tenth cen
tury, who counted El-Chasaiach as their founder (see Salmon's arti
cle, p. 98).

The Persecution under Decius, and the Suffer

martyrdom at Rome, and Cornelius suc

tine, Alexander," bishop of the church of
Jerusalem, was brought again on Christ's account

-

* Origen does not mention the baptism of the Elkesites, which is
described at length by Hippolytus. It seems that both belief in the
teachings of the book §§ were necessary.
It may be that
in Origen's opinion the receiving of the book itself involved the
peculiar baptism which it taught, and that, therefore, he thought it
unnecessary to mention the latter.

| Philip was defeated and slain near Verona, on June 17, 249, by
the Pannonian legions who had compelled Decius, the envoy sent
by Philip to quell a mutiny among them, to accept the title of
Augustus.
Philip's death made Decius emperor; and he reigned
for a little over two years, when he perished in a campaign agains:
the Goths. The cause given by Eusebius for the terrible persecu
tion of Decius is quite incorrect. The emperor, who before his ele
vation was one of the most highly respected senators, seems to have
been a man of noble character and of high aims. He was a thorough
oing patriot and a staunch believer in the religion and laws of
ome. He saw the terrible state of corruption and decay into which
the empire had fallen; and he made up W. mind that it could be
arrested only by restoring the ancient Roman customs, and by
strengthening the ancient religion. He therefore revived the old
censorship, hoping that the moral and social habits of the people
might be improved under its influence; and he endeavored to exter
minate the Christians, believing that thus the ancient purity of the
state religion might be restored.
It was no low motive of personal
revenge or of caprice which prompted the persecution. We must
recognize the fact that Decius was one of the best and noblest of the
Roman emperors, and that he persecuted as a patriot and a believer
in the religion of his fathers.
e was the first one that aimed at the
complete extermination of the Christians. He went systematically
to work to put the religion out of existence; and the persecution was
consequently both universal and of terrible severity, far more terri.
ble than any that had preceded it. The edicts published by Decius
early in the year 250 are no longer extant; but we can gather from
the notices, especially of Cyprian and Dionysius, that the effort was
first made to induce Christians throughout the empire to deny their
faith and return to the religion of the state, and only when large
numbers of them remained obstinate did the persecution itself begin.

* On Fabianus, bishop of Rome, sce chap. 29, note 4.
* After the martyrdom of Fabianus the church of Rome was
without a bishop for about fourteen months. The bishopric of that
church was naturally under Decius a place of the greatest danger.
Cornelius became bishop in 251, probably in March, while Decius
was away from the city.
After the emperor's death, which took
place in the following winter, Gallus renewed the persecution, and
Cornelius with a large part of the church fled to Cività Vecchia,
where he died in the summer of 253, according to Lipsius (the
Liberian catalogue says 252, which is the commonly accepted date
but is clearly incorrect, as Lipsius has shown).
the Chron, are greatly confused at this point, and their statements
are very faulty (Jerome's version assigning a reign of only fifteen
months to Dečius and two years and four months to Gallus). Fuse
bius, in Bk. VII. chap. 2, says that Cornelius held office "about
three years," which is reasonably accurate, for he was actually
bishop nearly two years and a |...}.
It was during the episcopate
of Cornelius that the Novatian schism took place (see chap. 43).
Eight epistles from Cyprian to Cornelius are extant, and two from
Cornelius to Cyprian.
In chap. 43 Eusebius makes extended quota
tions from an epistle written by Cornelius to Fabius of Antioch,
and mentions sil others which are not preserved.
In chap. 46 he
refers to one against Novatian addressed to Dionysius of Alexandria,
which is likewise lost.

his judge strove eagerly with all his might not

and accuracy."

* The time of Mazabanes' accession is fixed approximately by
the fact that Alexander's death took place in the persecution of

fixed by the death of Babylas in the persecution of Decius. He was
bishop of Antioch while Cornelius was bishop of Rome, as we
learn from the latter's epistle to him, quoted in chap. 43, below.
From an epistle written by Dionysius of Alexandria to Cornelius of
Rome (referred to in chap. 46), we learn that Fabius died while the
latter was still bishop, i.e. to: the summer of 253. (see note 3,
above). The Chron. Aasch. assigns three years to the episcopate
of Fabius; and though we cannot place much reliance upon the fig
ure, yet it leads us to think that he must have been bishop for some
time, - at least more than a year, - and so we are inclined to put
his death as late as possible. The Chron. puts the accession of his
successor Demetrianus in the year 254, which is too late, at least
for the death of Fabius. We may conclude that the latter died prob

Fabius, as we

rigoristic discipline favored by him. We know nothing more of the
life or character of Fabius.

CHAPTER XL.

The Events which happened to Dionysius.'

I SHALL quote from the epistle of Dionysius
to Germanus" an account of what befell the
former. Speaking of himself, he writes as follows:

* Dionysius the Great (Eusebius in the preface to Bk. VII.
close of the second centu o was an aged man, between 26o and
calls him o u eyas 'AAečavópeov on to komos) was born toward the
265, as we learn from Bk. Ri . chap 27), studied under Origen, and
succeeded Heraclas as principal of the catechetical school in Alexan
dria (see above, chap. 29) in the year 231 or 232 (see chap. 3, note 2).
In the third year of Philip's reign (246-247) he succeeded Heraclas
as bishop of Alexandria, according to chap. 35, above. Whether he
continued to preside over the catechetical school after he became
bishop we do not know.
Dittrich (p. 4 sq.) gives reasons for think
ing that he did, which render it at least probable. He was still
living when the earlier synods, in which the case of Paul of Samosata
was considered, were held (i.e. between 26o and 264; see, Bk. VII.
chap. 27, note 4), but he was dead before the last one met, i.e. before
265 A.D. (see #. VII. chap. 29, note 1).
Dionysius is one of the
most prominent, and at the same time pleasing, figures of his age.
He seems to have been interested less in speculative than in practi
cal questions, and yet he wrote an important work Qn Nature,
which shows that he possessed philosophical ability, and one of his
epistles contains a discussion of the authorship of the Apocalypse,
which is unsurpassed in the early centuries as an example of keen
and yet judicious and well-balanced literary criticism (see Bk. VII.
chap. 25). His intellectual abilities must, therefore, not be under
rated, but it is as a practical theologian that he is best known. He
took an active part in all the controversies of his time, in the Nova
tian difficulty in which the re-admission of the lapsed was the burning
uestion; in the controversy as to the re-baptism of heretics; and in
the case of Paul of Samosata. In all he played a prominent part, and
in all he seems to have acted with great wisdom and moderation o:
prisoner during the persecution of foil. but made his escape (see
chaps. 44 sq., Bk. VII. chaps. 5, 7 sq., chap. 27); He was taken
the present chapter).
In the persecution of Valerian he was ban
.." (see Bk. VII. chap. 11), but returned to Alexandria after the
accession of Gallienus (see Bk. VII. chap. 21). His conduct durin
the persecutions exposed him to adverse criticism, and he defende
himself warmly against the accusations of a bishop Germanus,
in an epistle, portions of which are quoted in this chapter and in
Bk. o chap. 11. The writings ...'..., were chiefly in the
form of epistles, written for some practical purpose. Of such epistles
he wrote a great many, and numerous fragments are extant, pre
served chiefly by Eusebius.
Being called forth by particular cir
cumstances, they contain much information in regard to contem
rary events, and are thus an important historical source, as Eusebius
wisely perceived. Such epistles are quoted, or mentioned, in chaps.
41, 44, 45, and 46 of this book, and in Bk. VII. chaps. 1, 2,4,5,6,
7, 9, 1o, 11, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26.
For particulars in regard to them,
In addition to his epistles a work

in Bk. VII. chaps. 24 and 25, where extracts from it are quoted (see
Bk.VII. chap. 24, note. 1); also a commentary on the beginning of
Ecclesiastes in Bk. VII. chap. 26, and in the same chapter a work
in four books against Sabellius, addressed to Dionysius, bishop of
Rome, in which he defends himself against the charge of tritheism,
brought by some Sabellian adversaries. He was able to clear him
self of all suspicion of heresy in the matter, though it is quite clear
that he had carried the subordinationism of Origen to a dangerous
extreme. The attack upon him led him to be more careful in his
statements, some of which were such as in part to justify the suspi

that Dionysius was honestly concerned to preserve the divinity of
the Son; but as in the case of Eusebius of Caesarea, and of all those
who were called upon to face Sabellianism, his tendency was to
lay an over-emphasis upon the subordination of the Son (see above,
p. 11 sq.). For further particulars in regard to this work, see the
chapter referred to, note 4. Upon Dionysius' views of the Trinity,
see Dittrich, p. 91 sq. . Besides the writings referred to, or quoted by
Eusebius, there should be mentioned an important canonical epistle
addressed to Basilides, in which the exact time of the cy piration of
the lenten fast is the chief subject of discussion (still extant, and
printed by Pitra, Routh, and others, and translated in the Ante
Nicenc Fathers; see Dittrich, p. 46 sq.).
There are yet a few
other fragments of Dionysius' writings, extant in various MSS.,
which it is not necessary, to mention here.
See Dittrich, p. 130.
The most complete collection of the extant fragments of his writings
is that of Migne, Patr. Gr. X. 1233 sq., to which must be added

before this, at the very hour when the
Decian persecution was commanded, Sabinus'
sent a frumentarius" to search for me, and I
remained at home four days awaiting his arrival.
But he went about examining all places, - roads,
rivers, and fields, - where he thought I might
be concealed or on the way.
But he was smit

for he did not suppose, that being pursued,
I would remain at home. And after the
fourth day God commanded me to depart,
and made a way for me in a wonderful manner;
and I and my attendants" and many of the
brethren went away together. And that this
occurred through the providence of God was
made manifest by what followed, in which
perhaps we were useful to some."
Farther
on he relates in this manner what happened

to him after his flight:

"For about sunset, having been seized with
those that were with me, I was taken by the
soldiers to Taposiris, but in the providence of
God, Timothy" was not present and was not

rately his conduct during the persecutions.
It must be remembered
that the letter is a defense against accusations actually made, or
we shall misunderstand it, and misinterpret Dionysius' motives in
dwelling at such length upon the details of his own sufferings. The
epistle, a part of which is quoted in this chapter, and a part in
Bk. VII. chap. 11, was written, as we learn srom the latter chapter,
§ 18, while the persecution of Valerian was still in progress, and
recounts his experiences during the persecutions of 1. and of
Valerian. The fragment quoted in the present chapter is devoted
to the persecution of Decius, the other fragment to the persecution
of Valerian. The letter is said to have been written mpos l'epuavor.
This might be translated either to or against German us. Analogy
would lead us to think the former translation correct, for all the
epistles mentioned are said to have been written mpos one or another
person, and it is natural, of course, to expect the name of the person
addressed to be given.
I have therefore translated the word thus,
as is done in all the versions. At the same time it must be noticed
that Germanus is spoken of in the epistle (especially in § 18 sq. of
the other chapter) not as if he were the person addressed, but as if
he were the person complained of to others; and, moreover, a letter
of defense sent to him alone would probably have little effect, and
would sail to put an end to the calumnies which must have sound
many ready ears.
It seems, in fact, quite probable that the epistle
was rather a public than a private one, and that while it was nomi
nally addressed to Germanus, it was yet intended for a larger pub
lic, and was written with that public in view.
This will explain the

he says:

when the man heard it (he was on his way
to a marriage feast, for it was customary to
spend the entire night in such gatherings), he
entered and announced it to those at the table.
And they, as if on a preconcerted signal, arose
with one impulse, and rushed out quickly and
came and burst in upon us with a shout. Immedi
ately the soldiers who were guarding us fled, and
they came to us lying as we were upon the
bare couches.
But I, God knows, thought
at first that they were robbers who had

Then I understood why they were come,
and I cried out, beseeching and entreating
them to depart and leave us alone. And I re
quested them, if they desired to benefit me in
any way, to anticipate those who were carrying
me off, and cut off my head themselves. And
when I had cried out in this manner, as my com

But they who had seized me carried me out of

It is reasonable to think him one
of the matóes, with others of whom Dionysius was arrested, as
recorded just above.
It is in that case of course necessary to give
the word as used there some other, or at least some broader sense
than "servants."

MARTYRS IN ALEXANDRIA.

CHAPTER XLI.

The Martyrs in A/exandria.

THE same writer, in an epistle to Fabius,'
bishop of Antioch, relates as follows the
sufferings of the martyrs in Alexandria under
Decius :

"The persecution among us did not begin
with the royal decree, but preceded it an entire
year." The prophet and author of evils" to this
city, whoever he was, previously moved and
aroused against us the masses of the heathen,
rekindling among them the superstition of
their country. And being thus excited by
him and finding full opportunity for any
wickedness, they considered this the only pious
service of their demons, that they should slay
us.

1 I read 448tov with the majority of the MSS., and with Vale
sius, Stroth, Burton, Closs, and Cruse, preserring to adopt the same
spelling here that is used in the other passages in which the same
bishop is mentioned. A number of MSS. read Pabarov, which is
supported by Rufinus, and adopted by Schwegler, Laemmer, and
Heinichen. On Fabius, bishop of Antioch, see chap. 39, note 7.
The time of his episcopate stated in that note fixes the date of this
epistle within narrow limits, viz. between 250 and the spring of
253. The whole tone of the letter and the discussion of the readmis
sion of the lapsed would lead us to think that the epistle was written
after the close of the persecution, but in § 20, Dioscorus is said to
be still among them, waiting for "a longer and more severe con
flict," which seems to imply that the persecution, if not raging at
the time, was at least expected to break out again soon.
This would
lead us to think of the closing months of Decius' reign, i.e. late in
the year 251, and this date finds confirmation in the consideration
that the epistle (as we learn from chap. 44) was written after the
breaking out of the Novatian schism, and apparently after the elec
tion of Novatian as opposition bishop, sor Fabius can hardly have
sided with him against o: bishop, so long as he was only a presby
Doubtless Novatian's official letter, announcing his election,
ter.
had influenced Fabius.
But Novatian was elected bishop in 251,
probably in the summer or early sall; at least, some months aster
Cornelius' accession, which took place in February, 251.
It seems;
from chap. 44, that Fabius was inclined to side with Novatian, and
to favor *i. rigoristic principles.
This epistle was written (as we
learn from chap. 42, § 6) with the express purpose of leading him
to change his position, and to adopt more lenient principles in his
treatment of the lapsed.
It is with this end in view that Dionysius
details at such length in this chapter the sufferings of the martyrs.
He wishes to impress upon Fabius their piety and steadfastness, in
order to beget greater respect for their opinions. Having done
this, he states d. they who best understood the temptations to
which the persecuted were exposed, had received the lapsed, when
repentant, into sellowship as |. (see chap. 42, note 6). hiomy.
sius' own position in the matter comes out very clearly in this
epistle. He was in full sympathy with the milder treatment of the
o: advocated in Rome and in Carthage by Cornelius and
rurian.
yo The edict of Decius was published early in the year 250, and
therefore the persecution in Å. according to Dionysius,
began in 249, while Philip was still emperor. Aoi..., the latter
showed the Christians favor, yet it is not at all surprising that this
socal persecution should break out during his reign. The peace
which the Christians were enjoying naturally fostered the growth of
the Church, and the more patriotic and pious of the heathen citizens
of the empire must necessarily have felt great solicitude at its con
stant increase, and the same spirit which led Decius to persecute
would lead many such persons to desire to persecute when the
opportunity offered itself; and the closing months of Philip's reign
were so troubled with rebellions and revolutions that he had little
time, and perhaps less inclination, to interfere in such a minor
matter as a local persecution of Christians. The common people
of Alexandria were of an excitable and riotous disposition, and it
was always easy there to stir up a tumult at short notice and upon
slight pretexts.

* o kakov to móAet tavrm uávris kai mount is. The last word
is rendered "poet" by most translators, and the rendering is quite
possible; but it is difficult to understand why I)ionysius should speak
of this person's being a poet, which could have no possible connec
tion with the matter in hand.
It seems better to take moonrms in
its common sense of "maker," or "author," and to suppose Diony
sius to be thinking of this man, not ..". as the prophet of evils to
the city, but also as their author, in that he "moved and aroused
against us the masses of the heathen."

"They seized first an old man named Metras," and commanded him to utter impious
words. But as he would not obey, they beat him
with clubs, and tore his face and eyes with sharp
sticks, and dragged him out of the city and
stoned him.
Then they carried to their
idol temple a faithful woman, named Quinta,
that they might force her to worship. And as
she turned away in detestation, they bound her
feet and dragged her through the entire city
over the stone-paved streets, and dashed her
against the millstones, and at the same time
scourged her; then, taking her to the same
place, they stoned her to death. Then all
with one impulse rushed to the homes of
the pious, and they dragged forth whomsoever
any one knew as a neighbor, and despoiled and
plundered them. They took for themselves the
more valuable property; but the poorer articles
and those made of wood they scattered about
and burned in the streets, so that the city
appeared as if taken by an enemy. But the
brethren withdrew and went away, and ‘took
joyfully the spoiling of their goods," like those
to whom Paul bore witness.
I know of no one
unless possibly some one who fell into their
hands, who, up to this time, denied the
Lord. Then they seized also that most ad
mirable virgin, Apollonia, an old woman,
and, smiting her on the jaws, broke out all her
teeth. And they made a fire outside the city
and threatened to burn her alive if she would
not join with them in their impious cries. And
she, supplicating a little, was released, when she
leaped eagerly into the fire and was con
sumed. Then they seized Serapion in his
own house, and tortured him with harsh cru
elties, and having broken all his limbs, they threw
him headlong from an upper story. And there
was no street, nor public road, nor lane open to
us, by night or day; for always and everywhere,
all of them cried out that if any one would not re
peat their impious words, he should immedi
ately be dragged away and burned. And mat
ters continued thus for a considerable time.
But a sedition and civil war came upon the
wretched people and turned their cruelty toward
us against one another." So we breathed for a
little while as they ceased from their rage against
us.
But presently the change from that milder
reign was announced to us,' and great fear

to the Gods upon taking office, and also to sacrifice at stated times
during his term of office, and upon special occasions, or in connection
with the performance of important official duties. He might thus be
called upon in his official capacity frequently to offer sacrifices, and
a failure to perform this part of his duties was looked upon as sacri
lege and punished as a crime against the state.
Christian officials,
therefore, were always in danger of suffering for their religion unless
they were allowed, as a special favor, to omit the sacrifices, as was
often the case under those emperors who were more favorably inclined
toward Christianity. A private citizen was never obliged to sacrifice
except in times of persecution, when he might be ordered to do so
as a test. But, an official could not carry out fully all the duties of

the Christians avoided public office, and thus drew upon t o
th: accusation of a lack of patriotism (cf. Origen, Contra Cess.
VI. 5 sq., and Tertullian's Apol. c. 42); and it is also one reason
why such Christians as happened to be in office were always the first
to suffer under a hostile emperor.

"Cf. Matt. xix. 23, . This sentence shows that Dionysius did
not consider it impossible even for those to be saved who denied
Christ before enduring any suffering at all. He was clearly willing
to leave a possibility of salvation even to the worst offenders, and in
this agreed ro, with Cornelius, Cyprian, and the body of the
Roman and Carthaginian churches.

But a soldier, named Besas, who stood by

however, are unanimous in their omission of the words, and the
second sentence below, which speaks of only a single Ammonarium,
as if there were no other, certainly argues against their insertion.
It is possible that Rufinus, finding only three women mentioned
after Dionysius had referred to four, ventured to insert the "other
Ammonaria."

17 It has been suggested (by Birks in the Dict, of Christ. Biog.)
that this Dioscorus may be identical with the presbyter of the same
name mentioned in Bk. VII. chap. 11, § 24.
But this is quite im
possible, for Dioscorus, as we learn from this passage, was but
fifteen years old at the time of the Decian persecution, and Diony
sius is still speaking of the same persecution when he mentions the
presbyter Dioscorus in the chapter referred to (see note 31 on that
chapter).

admiring the manner in which Dioscorus had

saying that on account of his youth he would

burned him between the robbers, thus honoring

seems as if Dionysius would have stated this directly if it, were a

It will be observed that nothing
is said here about joining with these persons in celebrating the
eucharist, or about admitting them to that service, and hence§.
sius is quite right in distinguishing the kind of communion spoken of
here from official communion in the church, around the Lord's table.
Dionysius does not imply that these confessors had the power given
them to receive the lapsed back again into the Church, and to dispense
the eucharist to them. That was the prerogative of the bishop, and
evidently Dionysius has no thought of its being otherwise. The
communion of which he speaks was private fellowship merely, and
implied a recognition on the part of these confessors that the persons
in question had truly repented of their sin, and could be recom
mended for readmission into the Church. As we see from chap. 44
§ 2, the recommendation of these persons or of the people in oneoi
was quite necessary, before the bishop would consent to absolve the
fallen person and receive him back again into the Church. And
Dionysius' words in this passage show that he felt that the judgment
of these confessors in regard to the fitness of the lapsed for read
mission ought to be received with consideration, and have influence
Dionysius thus shows great respect to the

claimed in some places (as we learn from Tertullian's de Predicitia,
22, and from a number of Cyprian's Epistles) of themselves ab
solving the lapsed and readmitting them to church communion.
In
this he showed again his agreement with Cyprian and with the prin
ciples finally adopted in the Roman and Carthaginian churches (cf.
e.g. Cyprian's EAistles, 9 sq., al., 15; see also Dittrich, p. 51 sq.).
* The object of the letter is clearly revealed in these sentences

(see chap., 41, note 1).

1 Eusebius, and the Greeks in general, write the name Noováros
(though in Bk. VII. chap. 8, below, Dionysius writes Noovaroos).
Socrates has the form Nauaros, which appears also in some MSS.
of Eusebius.
Cyprian and the Latins write the name Novatianus.
Lardner, in a note on chap. 47 of his Credibility, argues with great
force for the correctness of the name Novatus, while Heinichen and
others maintain that Novatianus is the right form. The name Mo
roatiani, Noovariavoi, which was given to his followers, is urged
with some reason by Lardner as an argument for the shorter form of
the name.
But even if his opinion is correct, the name Novatian is
too long established to be displaced, and serves to distinguish him
from the Carthaginian presbyter Novatus. The schism of Novatian
was only one of the outcrops of the old strife between lax and strict
discipline in the Church, the strife which had shown itself in con
nection with Montanism and also between Callistus and Hippolytus
But in the present case the imme

iate cause of the trouble was the treatment of the lapsed. The ter
rible Decian persecution had naturally caused many to deny the
faith, but afterward, when the stress was past, they repented and
desired to be readmitted to the Church. The question became a
very serious one, and opinions were divided, some advocating their
acceptance after certain prescribed penances, others their continued
exclusion. The matter caused a great deal of discussion, especially
in Rome and Carthage. The trouble came to a head in Rome, when
Cornelius, who belonged to the lax party, was chosen bishop in the
year 251, after the see had been vacant for more than a year. The
stricter party at once aroused to action and chose Novatian, the
leader o party, opposition bishop. He had been made a pres
byter by the bishop Fabian, and occupied a very prominent position
in the Roman Church. He seems originally to have held less rigid
notions in regard to the treatment of . lapsed, but before the end
of the persecution he became very decided in his opposition to their
absolution and restoration . His position, as well as his ability and
piety, made him the natural leader of the party and the rival candi
date for the bishopric. He does not, however, seem to have desired
to accept consecration as an opposition bishop, but his party insisted.
He immediately sent the usual letters announcing |. act to the
bishops of the principal sees, to Carthage, Alexandria, and Rome.
Cyprian at once refused to recognize his appointment.

Socrates, H. E. IV. 28, he suffered martyrdom under Valerian), but
his sect spread throughout the East and West, and continued in

in doctrine.
His character was austere, and of unblemished purity (the account
given by Cornelius below is a gross misrepresentation, from the pen
of an enemy), and his talents were of a high order. But the tendency
of the Church was toward a more merciful treatment of the lapsed
and of other sinners, and the stricter methods advocated by him sell
more and more into disfavor.
Novatian was quite a prolific writer.
According to Jerome, de vir. o. chap. 10, he wrote or Pascha, de
Saôato, de Circumcisione, de Sacerdote, de Oratione, de Ciêis

pastors of the remaining provinces deliberated
in their places privately concerning what ought

those who adopted his brother-hating and in
human opinion, should be considered by the
church as strangers; but that they should heal
such of the brethren as had fallen into misfor
tune," and should minister to them with the
medicines of repentance.

There have reached us epistles " of Cornelius, bishop of Rome, to Fabius, of the

Eusebius was correct in using the plural than that they were correct
in using the singular.
It is easy to understand the change of Euse
bius' indefinite plural into their definite singular. They were evi
dently written in Greek; for in speaking of Cyprian's epistles imme

were written in Latin. The epistle from which Eusebius quotes just
below was also written in Greek, for Eusebius would otherwise, as
is his custom, have mentioned the fact that he gives only a transla
tion of it. This has been pointed out by Valesius; but, as Routh
remarks, we can certainly go further, and say that the other epistle
mentioned by Eusebius must have been in Greek, too, since it was
written by the same Cornelius, and addressed to the same Fabius.
These epistles are no longer extant.

* These epistles from Cyprian and the African bishops Jerome
transforms into a single epistle from Cornelius to Fabius, de Aoza

plain this epistle mentioned by Jerome in any other way. . Knowing
the slovenly way in which he put his work together, it is not sur
prising that he should attribute these epistles to the same person who
wrote the ones mentioned just before and after.
Since the first epis
tles mentioned are said to have been addressed to Fabius and also
the last one, from which Eusebius quotes, it is reasonable to conclude
that all mentioned in this connection were addressed to him; and it
would of course be quite natural for Cyprian, too, to write to Fabius
#. was known to be inclined to favor Novatian), in order to con
irm the account of Cornelius, and to announce that he agreed with
the latter in regard to the treatment of the lapsed. No epistle, how
ever, of Cyprian or of other African bishops to Fabius are extant,
though the same subject is discussed in many epistles of Cyprian
addressed to the people.

* Rufinus mentions only two epistles of Cornelius in this connec
tion, apparently confounding this one on the deeds of the Novatians
with the one mentioned just before on the Decrees of the Council.
Jerome, on the other hand, making Cornelius, as already mentioned,
the author of the epistles of Cyprian and the African ... assigns
four epistles to Cornelius. N. of the epistles mentioned in this
section are extant, except the long fragment of the last one quoted
just below. As mentioned in the next chapter, Fabius inclined to
take the side of Novatian over against the laxer party; and it was
on this account that Cornelius wrote him so many epistles (compare
also the epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria, quoted in chaps. 41 and
42, and see note 1 on the former chapter), and endeavored to blacken
the character of Novatian as he does in the passages quoted.

* This Maximus was a presbyter, and one of a party of Roman
confessors who played a prominent part in the controversy about
the lapsed. He and his companions were imprisoned at §e very
beginning of the Decian persecution (Cyprian, Ep. 24; a 2.28), i.e.
early in the year 250, and while in prison they adopted rigoristic
views and wrote to some Carthaginian confessors, urging strict
methods in dealing with the lapsed (see Cyprian, EA, 22; al. 27).
Early in the year 251, after eleven months in prison, the presbyter
Moses, the leading spirit of the party, died, and Maximus became
the chief one among them. . Moses before his death, in spite of his
rigoristic principles, refused to commune with Novatian and his five
presbyters (as we learn from $ 20 of this chapter), apparently be
cause he saw that his insistence upon strict discipline was tending
toward schism, and that such discipline could not be maintained
without sacrificing the Church.
But Maximus and those mentioned
with him here, together with some others (see Cyprian, Ep. 45:
al. 49), became even stricter than at first, and finally went over to
the party of Novatian (which took its rise after the ... of Cor
nelius in 251), but were at length reconciled to Cornelius and the
rest of the Church, and received back with rejoicing (see Cyprian,
§. 43, 45, 46.49, 59: as 46, 49, 51, 53, 54). The notices of
Maximus and Urbanus in Cyprian's epistles, which with the epistle
of Cornelius constitute our only source for a knowledge of their
lives, do not mention a second confession made by these two men,
so that we cannot tell when it took place, but it must of course have
been during the persecution of Decius.
" Urbanus was a confessor only, not a presbyter or deacon, as
we learn from the notices of him in Cyprian's epistles, in connec
tion with the party referred to in the previous note.

11 Sidonius likewise was a confessor simply, and is mentioned

with the others in the epistles of Cornelius and Cyprian.

1° Celerinus was also one of this party of Roman confessors (as
we learn from Cyprian, Ep. 15, al. 87), who, upon his release from
rison, went to Carthage, and was there ordained a reader by
His release from prison and departure
yprian (Ep. 33, af. 39).
for Carthage took place before the release of *: others and before
the death of Moses (as we learn from Ep. 15), that is, before the
end of the year 250. He was still in Rome, io. at Easter of
that year, as we learn from his epistle to Lucian, mentioned below.
He came of a family of martyrs (Ep. 33), and was himself one of
the most celebrated confessors of his time. There is extant an epis
tle written by him to Lucian, the Carthaginian confessor (Cyprian,
A.A. 21), in which he begs absolution for his sisters, who had denied
the faith. The epistle (as we learn from its own statements) was
written at Easter time and in the year 250, for there was no bishop
of Rome at the time of its composition. As we learn from this pas
sage, Celerinus went over with these other Roman confessors to the
party of Novatian, and returned with them to the Church. He is, how
ever, mentioned neither by Cyprian nor by Cornelius (in his epistle
to Cyprian) in connection o the schism of these confessors. This
is very remarkable, especially since Celerinus was quite a prominent
character.
It is possible that he was in Carthage the greater part
of the time, and did not return to Rome until shortly before the
confessors returned to the Church. He might then have thrown in
his lot with them, and have returned with them to the orthodox
church; and yet, not having been mentioned by Cornelius' earlier
epistle to Cyprian, announcing the schismatic position of the con
sessors, he was omitted also in the later letters announcing their
return (which in fact only mentions the three leaders), and in
Cyprian's reply, which of course would only mention those of whom
he had been told in Cornelius' first epistle. Of the subsequent
career of Celerinus and of these other confessors we know nothing.
13. There is no reason to doubt, as Cornelius does, Novatian's
sincerity in declaring that he did not seek the office of bishop. Both
Cornelius and Cyprian make his ambition and his jealousy of Cor
nelius, the successful candidate, the cause of his schism.
ut such
an accusation was made against every schismatic, even when there
was not a shadow of support for it, and there is no reason to sup
pose it nearer the truth in this than in other cases. In fact, his own
rotestation, as recorded here by Cornelius, and as testified to by
}. in chap. 45, as well as the character of the man as revealed
in his life previous to his episcopal ordination (as certified to even
by his enemies), and in his writings, are entirely opposed to the
supposition that he sought the episcopal office and that his schism
was a result of his defeat. We shall do much better to reject en
tirely this exceedingly hostile and slanderous account of his enemy
Cornelius, and to accept his own account of the matter as reported
by Dionysius in chap. 25. He was the natural head of the rigor
istic party, made such by his commanding ability, his of piety,
and his ascetic principles of living; and when Cornelius, the head
of the lax party, was made bishop (in March, 251), the strict party
revolted, and it could not be otherwise than that Novatian should be
elected bishop, and that even if reluctant he should feel compelled to
accept the office in order to assert the principles which he believed
vital, and to prevent the complete ruin of the Church. Cornelius
gives a sad story of his ordination to the episcopate. But one thing
is certain, he had with him for some time a large portion of the best
people in the Roman church, among them Maximus and others of
the most influential confessors, who seem at length to have returned

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

ly appears a bishop as if thrown among us
by some machine." For this dogmatist, this
defender of the doctrine of the Church,"
attempting to grasp and seize the episcopate,
which had not been given him from above,
chose two of his companions who had given up
their own salvation.
And he sent them to a
small and insignificant corner of Italy, that there
by some counterfeit argument he might deceive
three bishops, who were rustic and very simple
men. And they asserted positively and strongly
that it was necessary that they should come
quickly to Rome, in order that all the dissen
sion which had arisen there might be appeased
through their mediation, jointly with other
bishops. When they had come, being, as
we.have stated, very simple in the craft and
artifice of the wicked, they were shut up with
certain selected men like himself. And by the
tenth hour, when they had become drunk and
sick, he compelled them by force to confer
on him the episcopate through a counterfeit and

come to him, he avenged himself by craft
and treachery. One of these bishops shortly
after came back to the church, lamenting
and confessing his transgression. And we com
muned with him as with a layman, all the people
present interceding for him. And we ordained
successors of the other bishops, and sent
them to the places where they were.
This
avenger of the Gospel" then did not know
that there should be one bishop in a catholic
church; " yet he was not ignorant (for how

to the Church only because they saw that the schism was injuring it.
Certainly if Novatian had been a self-seeker, as Cornelius describes
him, and if his ordination had been of such a nature as Cornelius
reports, he could never have had the support of so, many earnest
and prominent men.
It is doubtless true, as Cornelius states, that
Novatian was ordained by three Italian bishops, very likely bishops
of rural and comparatively insignificant sees, and it is quite possible
that one of them, as he also records, afterwards repented of his act
as schismatic, and returned to the Church and received absolution.
But all this does not imply that these three bishops were deceived
by false pretenses on the part of Novatian, or that they were intoxi
cated when they performed the service. This, in fact, may be looked
upon as baseless calumny.
Novatus, the Carthaginian agitator who
had caused Cyprian so much trouble, took a prominent part in the
Novatian schism, though to make him the author of it, as Cyprian
does, is undoubtedly incorrect (see Lardner, JH orks, III. p. 94 sq.;
It was perhaps he (as reported by É. ogius,
London ed. 1829).
according to Photius, Cod. 182, and by Theodoret, Harr. Fab. III. 5)
that found these three bishops to ordain Novatian.
It is not at all
improbable, when so many prominent men in the Roman church
favored the stricter princi 's and supported Novatian, that bishops
could be found in Italy who held the same principles and would
glad to ordain Novatian as bishop of Rome.

Possibly another sarcastic reser

* The principle, that there should be only one bishop in a city,
was not clearly enunciated and forcibly emphasized until the third
century.
Cyprian's writings are full of it (cf. his treatise On the
Unity of the Church), and in connection with this Novatian schism,
which showed so plainly the disintegrating effects of a division of
the church under two bishops, the principle was established so
firmly as never again to be questioned.
I do not mean to assert
here that the principle so clearly and conclusively established at this
time was a new principle. We find it enunciated even by Ignatius
at the beginning of the second century, and it was the common

and kindness of the Master nourish.
But
not even this great multitude, so necessary
in the church, nor those who, through God's
providence, were rich and full, together with the
very many, even innumerable people, could turn
him from such desperation and presump
tion and recall him to the Church." Again,
farther on, he adds these words:

"Permit us to say further: On account of
what works or conduct had he the assurance to
contend for the episcopate? Was it that he had
been brought up in the Church from the begin

such a test as to require its formal enunciation and public recog
nition by the clergy and the Church at large. The emergency which
now arose compelled such formal statement of it; and the Council of
Nicaea made it canon law (cf. Bingham's Antiquities, I. p. 169 sq.).
* The limitation of the deacons to seven in number was due to
the fact that the appointment of the Seven by the apostles (Acts vi.)
was commonly looked upon as the institution of the office of the

was quite a common one, and was enacted as a law in the fifteenth

tury). The practice, however, was by no means universal, as we
are informed by Sozomen (H. E. VII. 19).
Indeed, at least in
Alexandria and in Constantinople, their number was much greater
(see Bingham's Amt. I. p. 286).

* The sub-deacons (the highest of the inferior orders of the
clergy) are first mentioned in this epistle of Cornelius and in various
epistles ofo At what time they arose we cannot tell, but
they seem to have appeared in the East later than in the West, at
least the first references we have to them in the Orient are in the
fourth century, e.g. in the Apost. Const. VIII. 21. They acted as
deacons' assistants, preparing the sacred vessels for use at the altar,
attended the doors during communion service, and were often em
ployed by the bishops for the conveyance of letters or messages to
distant churches. , See Bingham's Ant. Bk. III. chap. 2.

"In the time of persecution, through coward

treated by the deacons to come out of the
chamber in which he had imprisoned himself,
and give aid to the brethren as far as was lawful
and possible for a presbyter to assist those of

things, he adds the following:

baptism, as here stated by Cornelius.

commonly supposed, that he was of heathen parentage, for many
Christians postponed baptism as long as possible, in order not to
sacrifice baptismal grace by sins ...so baptism. We do
not know whether #. parents were heathen or Christians. Upon

among the Latins); that is, the imposition of the hands of the

At the same time, if a person
died after baptism, before it was possible to receive imposition of
hands, the baptism was not regarded as rendered invalid by the omis
sion, for in the baptism itself the full remission of sins was supposed
to be granted. The confirmation was not necessary for such remis
sion, but was necessary for the bestowal of the requisite sustaining
grace for the Christian life. Cornelius in the present paragraph does
not intend to imply that regenerating grace was not given in Nova
tian's baptism. }}. means simply that the Holy Spirit was not given
in that full measure in which it was given by the laying on of hands,
and which was necessary for growth in grace and Christian living.
The baptism was looked on in ordinary cases as in a sense negative,
- effecting the washing away of sin, the laying on of hands as posi
tive, confirming the gift of the Spirit. o: former, therefore, was
sufficient to save the man who died immediately thereafter: the
latter was necessary to sustain the man who still remained in the
world.
Compare with these words of Cornelius Tertullian's de
Baptism. chap. 6. The earliest extant canon on this subject is the
thirty-eighth of the synod of Elvira (306 A.D.), which decrees that
a o person may in case of necessity be baptized by a layman, but
that he is afterward, if he recovers, to be taken to the bishop that
the baptism may be perfected by the laying on of hands.
The
seventy-seventh canon decrees the same thing for those baptized by
deacons, but expressly declares that if the baptized person die before

For further par
ticulars, see Bingham, ibid. Bk. XII.

On the signification of the verb or bpayigo, see Suicer's Thesau
rus. We can hardly believe that Novatian failed to receive imposi
tion of hands from the bishop, for it is inconceivable that the latter
would have omitted what was regarded as such an important pre:
requisite to church communion in the case of one whom he ordained
to the presbyterate. Novatian may not have received confirmation
immediately after his recovery, but he must have received it before
his ordination. As seen in § 17, it is not the omission of confirma
tion that causes the objections on the part of the clergy, but the
clinical baptism.

"For this illustrious man forsook the Church
of God, in which, when he believed, he was
judged worthy of the presbyterate through the
favor of the bishop who ordained him to the
presbyterial office.
This had been resisted by
all the clergy and many of the laity; because it
was unlawful that one who had been affused on
his bed on account of sickness as he had been
should enter into any clerical office ; * but the
bishop requested that he might be permitted
to ordain this one only." He adds to these
yet another, the worst of all the man's of.
fenses, as follows:

"For when he has made the offerings, and
distributed a part to each man, as he gives it he
compels the wretched man to swear in place of
the blessing.
Holding his hands in both of his
own, he will not release him until he has sworn
in this manner (for I will give his own words):
"Swear to me by the body and blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ that you will never for
sake me and turn to Cornelius.' And the
unhappy man does not taste until he has
called down imprecations on himself; and in
stead of saying Amen, as he takes the bread,
he says, I will never return to Cornelius."
Farther on he says again:

"But know that he has now been made

bare and desolate; as the brethren leave him

* This is certainly a calumny.

It is possible, as Neander sug
ests, that Novatian, although a presbyter, withdrew somewhat
rom active duty and lived the life of an ascetic, and that it is this
to which Cornelius refers in speaking of his admiration for "another
philosophy."
But however that may be, Cornelius' interpretation
of his conduct as cowardly or unworthy is quite false. See above,
note I.

* Clinic baptism (so-called from KAvn, "a bed") was ordinarily
looked upon in the early Church, in .. immersion was the com
In on ...; baptism, as permanently debarring a person from the
presbyterate, and by many persons it was denied that, such baptism
was baptism at all. The latter opinion, however, the Church re
fused to sustain (cf. Cyprian, EA, 75; al. 19). The twelfth canon
of the Council of Neo-Caesarea (held early in the fourth century)
says, "If any man is baptized only in time of sickness, he shall not
be ordained a presbyter; because his faith was not voluntary, but
as it were of constraint; except his subsequent faith and diligence
recommend him, or else the scarcity of men make it necessary to
ordain him.""it is clear that this canon meant to apply only to
persons whose baptism was delayed by their own fault.
It was
common for catechumens to postpone the rite as long as possible in
order not to forfeit baptismal grace by their post-baptismal sins,
and it was to discourage this practice that such canons as this of
Neo-Caesarea were passed.
ven this canon, however, provided
for exceptional cases, and the fact that Novatian was ordained in
spite of i. irregular baptism is a proof that he must have been an
exceptionally pious and zealous man.

Lipsius (Chron. der röm. Bischöfe, p. 202, note), maintains
that Cornelius is referring, at this point, not to Novatian, but to
Novatus, the Carthaginian presbyter, and that Eusebius has con
founded the two men. He bases this opinion upon the mention of
the five presbyters, whom he identifies with those who, with Nova
tus, separated from the Carthaginian church in connection with the
schism of Felicissimus (see Cyprian, EA. 39; al. 43), and also upon

to refer Cornelius' words in this paragraph to the same five men.

be very peculiar, for Novatus himself was one of the five, and there

among us a glorious and admirable martyrdom,
while he was yet alive, beholding his boldness
and folly, refused to commune with him and
with the five presbyters who with him had sep
arated themselves from the church."

At the close of his letter he gives a list
of the bishops who had come to Rome and
condemned the silliness of Novatus, with their
names and the parish over which each of
them presided. He mentions also those
who did not come to Rome, but who ex
pressed by letters their agreement with the vote
of these bishops, giving their names and the
cities from which they severally sent them."
Cornelius wrote these things to Fabius, bishop of
Antioch.

To this same Fabius, who seemed to lean
somewhat toward this schism," Dionysius of
Alexandria also wrote an epistle." He writes in
this many other things concerning repentance,
and relates the conflicts of those who had lately
suffered martyrdom at Alexandria.
After the
other account he mentions a certain wonderful

lived for a long time blamelessly, but had fallen
in the trial. He besought often, but no one
gave heed to him, because he had sacrificed.
But he became sick, and for three successive
days continued speechless and senseless.
Having recovered somewhat on the fourth
day he sent for his daughter's son, and
said, "How long do you detain me, my child?
I beseech you, make haste, and absolve me
Call one of the presbyters to me.'
speedily.
And when he had said this, he became again
speechless. And the boy ran to the presbyter.
But it was night and he was sick, and there
fore unable to come.
But as I had com
manded that persons at the point of death,
if they requested it, and especially if they had
asked for it previously, should receive remission,

would inevitably lead to schism. There remains, therefore, no rea
son for supposing Eusebius mistaken, and for referring these words
to Novatus of Carthage, instead of Novatian of Rome.

* These lists of the bishops present at the council, and of those
who expressed their agreement with the decision of the synod, are
no longer extant.

* See above, chap. 39, note 7.
* This epistle, as we may gather from the description of its con
tents in the next sentence, is without doubt the same from which
Eusebius has quoted at such length in chaps. 41 and 42. Upon the
date and purpose of it, see chap. 41, note 1. We possess only the
fragments quoted by Eusebius in these three chapters.

* Of this Serapion we know only what is told us in this chapter,

that they might depart with a good hope, he
gave the boy a small portion of the eucharist,
telling him to soak" it and let the drops fall
into the old man's mouth." The boy returned with it, and as he drew near, before
he entered, Serapion again arousing, said, ‘Thou
art come, my child, and the presbyter could not
come ; but do quickly what he directed, and
let me depart."
Then the boy soaked it and
dropped it into his mouth. And when he had
swallowed a little, immediately he gave up
the ghost.
Is it not evident that he was
preserved and his life continued till he was
absolved, and, his sin having been blotted out,
he could be acknowledged" for the many good
deeds which he had done?"

Dionysius relates these things.

The word does not necessarily carry the idea of reproof with it, but
it is natural to suppose in the present case that it was written while
Dionysius was absent from Alexandria, during the persecution of
Decius, and if so, may well have contained an admonition to stead
fastness, and at the same time, possibly, an argument against rigor

in reference to the lapsed. At least, the connection in which Euse

* This epistle was doubtless written while Origen was suffering
imprisonment in the persecution of Decius (see above, chap. 39, and
below, p. 394), and was for the purpose of comforting and encour
aging him (cf. Origen's own work on martyrdom, referred to in
chap. 28, above). The epistle is no longer extant. Numerous frag
ments are given by Gallandi, Migne, and others, which they assign
to this ... but%. has shown (p. 35 sq.) that they are to be
ascribed to some one else, perhaps to another Dionysius who lived
much later than the great bishop.

ut its authority is of no weight. On the other hand, Eusebius'
words seem plainly to indicate that he believed that the council was

thought of it only as projected, he could hardly have referred to it
in such definite terms. }. spite, therefore, of the doubts of Dittrich,
Hesele, and others, I am inclined to believe that Eusebius supposed
that the synod had actually been held in Antioch.
Whether the
epistle of Dionysius warranted him in drawing that conclusion is
another question, which cannot be decided.

latter chapter we should gather that he presided at the final council
in Antioch, which ...i condemnation upon Paul, Firmilian, who
seems to have presided at the previous councils, having died on his
way to the last one. Of Helenus' dates we know only what we can
gather from the facts here stated. He must have been bishop as
early as 252; and he cannot have died until after 265 (on the date of
the Antiochian synod at which Paul was condemned, see Bk. VII.
chap. 29, note 1).

14, 27, and 30.
The date of his accession is uncertain; but as
Fabius died probably in 253 (possibly in 252), we can fix approxi
mately the beginning of his episcopate. In Bk. VII. chaps. 5 and 14,
he is said to have survived Gallienus' edict of toleration (26o A.D.);
but as Harnack has shown (Zeit does /gnatius, p. 51), this notice is
quite unreliable, as are also the notices in the Chronicle. We can
only oy that his successor, Paul, became bishop between the years
257 and 26o.

Roman church (see above, chaps. 20 and 22), and no other Hippoly

In view of Eusebius' mention of
the name at this point, I am inclined, however, to think that he,
knowing so little about the Roman Hippolytus, fancied that this was
the same man. If he did, he had good reason to mention him. The

Rufinus translates epistola de ministerås, Valesius,

the word in any other way. Why Dionysius should address an epistle
on this subject to the Roman church it is impossible to say. Magis
tris supposed that it was called " diaconal

indeed can we assume that a diaconal epistle as such (whether the

* Of this Hermainmon we know nothing. The words of Euse

probably a bishop of some church in Egypt.
Fragments of the
epistle addressed to him are preserved in this chapter and in chapters
to and 23, below.
It is possible that Dionysius wrote more than one
epistle to Hermanmon and that the fragments which we have are
from different letters.
This, however, is not probable, for Eusebius
gives no hint that he is quoting from more than one epistle, and,

the Christians. The date of the epistle is given at the close of
chap. 23; namely, the ninth year o the Emperor Gallienus (i.e.
August, 261-August, 262), reckoning from the time of his associa
tion with his father Valerian in the purple.

* Gallus succeeded Decius toward the close of the year 251
and reigned until the summer of 253 (some with less ground say

254), when he was slain, with his son, by his own soldiers.

His
rsecution of the Christians (under him, for instance, Cornelius,
ishop of Rome, was banished, see above, Bk. VI. chap. 39, note 3),
seems to have been less the result of a deeply rooted religious con
viction and a fixed political principle §: as Decius possessed)
than of the terrible plague wo ad begun during the reign of
Decius and was ravaging the empire during the early part of Gallus'
reign (see Tillemont's Hist, des Emp. III. p. 288).

therefore, not so much as a matter of principle as because he desired
either to appease the populace, or to propitiate the Gods, whom
he superstitiously believed, as the people did, to be the authors of
the terrible scourge.

* Qn Cornelius, see Bk. VI. chap. 39, note 3.
* Eusebius makes Cornelius' episcopate a year too long (see
Bk. VI, chap. 39, note 3), and hence puts the accession of Julius too
late. Jerome puts him in the second year of Gallus (see the same
note) and gives the duration of his episcopate as eight months, agree
ing with Eusebius in the present passage. The Armenian Chron.
puts Lucius in the seventh year of Philip, and assigns only two
months to hiso B. it is far out of the way, as also in
regard to Cornelius. The Liberian catalogue assigns three years
and eight months to Lucius' episcopate, putting his death in 255;
but Lipsius has shown conclusively that |. must be incorrect, and
concludes that he held office eight months, from June, 253, to March,
254. He was banished while bishop of Rome, but returned ve
soon, and died in a short time, probably a natural death. The N.
in regard to the lapsed, begun while Cornelius was bishop, continued
under him, and he followed the liberal policy of his predecessor.
One letter of Cyprian addressed to him is extant (Ep. 57; al. 61).

* Lipsius puts the accession of Stephen on the twelfth of May,
254, and his death on the second of August, 257, assigning him an
episcopate of three years, two months and twenty-one days. The
dates given by the chief authorities vary greatly. The Liberian
catalogue gives four years, two months and twenty-one days, which
Lipsius corrects simply by reading three instead of four years, for
Eusebius, in
the latter figure is impossible (see chap. 5, note 5).
chap. 5, tells us that Stephen held office two years.
Jerome's ver
sion of the Chron, says three years, but puts his accession in the
second year of Gallus, which is inconsistent with his own statement
that Cornelius became bishop in the first year of Gallus. The Arme
nian Chron. agrees with Eusebius' statement in chap. 5, below, in
assigning two years to the episcopate of Stephen, but puts his acces
sion in the seventh year of Philip, which, like his notices of Cornelius
and Lucius is far out of the way.

The discussion in regard to the lapsed still continued under
Stephen.
But the chief controversy of the time was in regard to
the re-baptism of heretics, which caused a severe rupture between the
churches of Rome and Carthage.
Stephen held, in accordance with
ancient usage and the uniform custom of the Roman church (though
under Callistus heretics were re-baptized according to Hippolytus,
Phil. IX. 7), that baptism, even by heretics and schismatics, is
valid; and that one so baptized is not to be re-baptized upon enterin
the orthodox church, but is to be received by the imposition o
Cyprian, on the other hand, supported by the whole of the
hands.

and the necessity of re-baptism.
The controversy became very
sharp, and seems to have resulted in Stephen's hurling an excom

ai. 73), does not trace it back beyond Agrippinus, bishop of Carthage,
o whom the practice was sanctioned by a council (186-187 or
215-217 A.D.). Under Cyprian himself, the practice was confirmed
by a council at Carthage, in 255 A.D. The more liberal view of the
Roman church, however, in time prevailed and was confirmed with
some limitations by the Council of Arles, in 314.
Stephen figures
in tradition as a martyr, but there is no reason to think that he was
one, for the Church was enjoying comparative peace at the time of
his death. Two epistles are extant, addressed to him by Cyprian
(Nos. 66 and 71, al. 68 and 72). A number of Cyprian's epistles
refer to Stephen.

* Six epistles by Dionysius on the subject of baptism are men
tioned by Eusebius (see below, chap. 5, note 6).
It is clear that
Dionysius, so far as Eusebius knew, wrote but one to Stephen
on this subject, for he calls the one which he wrote to Xystus the
second (in chap. 5).
Dionysius' own opinion on the subject of
re-baptism is plain enough from Eusebius' words in this chapter,
and also from Dionysius' own words in chap. 5, below. He sided
with the entire Eastern and African church in refusing to admit the
validity of heretical baptism, and in requiring a convert from the
heretics to be "washed and cleansed from the filth of the old and
impure leaven" (see chap. 5, § 5).

epistle on baptism was addressed to Stephen, and in chap. 5 informs
us that his second was addressed to Xystus. The epistle mentioned

entirely different one, viz. upon the peace which had been estab
lished in the Eastern churches, after the disturbances caused by the
schism of Novatian (see Bk. VI. chap. 43 sq.). That the peace
spoken of in this epistle cannot mean, as Baronius held, that the
Eastern churches had come over to Stephen's opinion in regard to
the subject of baptism is clear enough from the fact that Dionysius
wrote another epistle to Stephen's successor (see the next chapter)

had abated," the churches everywhere had re
jected the novelty of Novatus, and were at
peace among themselves. He writes as follows:

CHAPTER V.

The Peace fo/lowing the Persecution.

"BUT know now, my brethren, that all
the churches throughout the East and be
yond, which formerly were divided, have become
united. And all the bishops everywhere are of
one mind, and rejoice greatly in the peace which
has come beyond expectation. Thus Demetri
anus in Antioch," Theoctistus in Caesarea, Maza
banes in AElia, Marinus in Tyre (Alexander
having fallen asleep)," Heliodorus in Laodicea
(Thelymidres being dead), Helenus in Tarsus,
and all the churches of Cilicia, Firmilianus, and
all Cappadocia.
I have named only the more
illustrious bishops, that I may not make my
epistle too long and my words too burden
some. And all Syria, and Arabia to which
you send help when needed," and whither
you have just written,* Mesopotamia, Pontus,
Bithynia, and in short all everywhere are re
joicing and glorifying God for the unanimity
and brotherly love." Thus far Dionysius.

But Stephen, having filled his office two
years, was succeeded by Xystus." Diony

In fact, the
passage quoted by Eusebius from Dionysius' epistle to Stephen has
no reference to the subject of baptism.

* The persecution referred to is that of Decius.

the position which it occupies above in my translation.
It is natu
ral, of course, to think of the famous Alexander of Jerusalem as re
ferred to here (Bk: VI. chap. 8, note 6), but it is difficult to see how,
if he were referred to, the words could stand in the position which
they occupy in the text.
It is not impossible, however, to assume
simple carelessness on Dionysius' part to cxplain the peculiar order,
and thus hold that Alexander of Jerusalem is here referred to. Nor
is it, on the other hand, impossible (though certainly difficult) to
suppose that Dionysius is referring to a bishop of Tyre named Alex
ander, whom we hear of from no other source.

* The church of Rome had been from an early date very liberal
in assisting the needy in every quarter.
See the epistle of Diony
sius of Corinth to Soter, bishop of Rome, quoted above in Bk. IV.
chap. 21.
"onysius speaks, just below (§ 6) of epistles or an epistle of
Stephen upon the subject of baptism, in which he had announced
that he would no longer commune with the Oriental bishops, who
held to the custom of baptizing heretics. And it is this epistle which
must have stirred up the rage of Firmilian, which shows itself in his
epistle to Cyprian, already mentioned. The epistle of Stephen re
ferred to here, however, cannot be identical with that one, or Dio
nysius would not speak of it in such a pleasant tone. . It very likely

Lipsius retains the months and days
(twelve or six days), rejecting the two years as an interpolation, and
thus putting his accession on Aug. 24 (or 31), 257.
According to
Eusebius, chap. 27, and the Armenian Chron., he held office eleven
years, which is quite impossible, and which, as Lipsius remarks, is
due to the cleven months which stood in the original source from
which the notice was taken, and which appears in the Liberian
catalogue. Jerome's version of the Chrone. ascribes eight years to
his episcopate, but this, too, is quite impossible, and the date given
for his accession (the first year of Valerian) is inconsistent with

Of the life of Sabellius we know very little. He was at the
head of the Monarchian (modalistic) party in Rome during the
episcopate, of Zephyrinus (198-217), and was there perhaps even
earlier. He is, and was already in the fourth century, commonly
called a native of Africa, but the first one directly to state this is
Basil, and the opinion seems to rest upon the fact that his views
were especially popular in Pentapolis as early as the middle of the
third century, as Dionysius says here. , Hippolytus in speaking of
him does not mention his birthplace, which causes Stokes to incline

and a want of perception of the Holy Spirit,

both sides and brethren discussing the matter,

Of these I send" thee copies."

CHAPTER VII.

The Abominable Error of the Heretics; the
Divine Vision of Dionysius; and the Eccle
siastical Canon which he received.

IN the third epistle on baptism which
this same Dionysius wrote to Philemon,"
the Roman presbyter, he relates the following:

"But I examined the works and traditions of
the heretics, defiling my mind for a little time
with their abominable opinions, but receiving
this benefit from them, that I refuted them
by myself, and detested them all the more.
And when a certain brother among the
presbyters restrained me, fearing that I
should be carried away with the filth of their
wickedness (for it would defile my soul), - in
which also, as I perceived, he spoke the truth,

to the opinion that he was a native of Rome. The matter, in fact,
cannot be decided. We are told by Hippolytus that Callistus led
Sabellius into heresy, but that after he became pope he excommu
nicated him in order to gain a reputation for orthodoxy. Of the
later life of Sabellius we know nothing.
His writings are no longer
extant, though there are apparently quotations from some of them
in Epiphanius, Haer. 62, o Athanasius, Contra Arian. Oratio 4.
In the third century those Monarchians (modalists) who were
known as Patripassians in the West were called Sabellians in the
East.
In the fourth and fifth centuries the Fathers used the term
Sabellianism in a general sense for various forms of Monarchianism,
all of which, however, tended in the one direction, viz. toward the
denial of any personal distinction in the Godhead, and hence the
identification of Father and Son. And so we characterize every
teaching which tends that way as Sabellianistic, although this form of

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[VII. 7.

- a vision sent from God came and strength
ened me. And the word which came to
me commanded me, saying distinctly, "Read
everything which thou canst take in hand,"
for thou art able to correct and prove all; and
this has been to thee from the beginning the
cause of thy faith.'
I received the vision as
agreeing with the apostolic word, which says
to them that are stronger, ‘Be skillful money

changers.'" "

all the heresies he adds: "I received this

• Dionysius, in following this vision, was but showing himself a
genuine disciple of his master Origen, and exhibiting the true spirit
of the earlier Alexandrian school.

as āroa roaki, bovňavysp;xov... yūrea 6e 36xuot rpanegirat.
This saying, sometimes in the brief form given here, sometimes as
part of a longer sentence (e.g. in Clement of Alex. Strom. I. 28,
yovegoe & 66xiwot roamegital, Tå key àmočokuggovres, so & Kaxov
Karexovres), appears very frequently in the writings of the Fathers.
In some cases it is cited (in connection with 1 Thess. v. 21, 22) on
the authority of Paul (in the present case as an "apostolic word"),
in other cases on the authority of "Scripture" (m ypab m, or Yeypa
m rat, or 6e tos Aoyos), in still more cases as an utterance of Christ
himself.
There can be little doubt that Christ really did utter these
words, and that the words used by Paul in 1 Thess. v. 21, 22, were
likewise, spoken by Christ in the same connection. We may, in
fact, with considerable confidence recognize in these words part of
a genuine extra-canonical so of Christ, which was widely cur
rent in the early Church. We are to explain the words then not
as so many have done, as merely based upon the words of Christ,
reported in Matt. xxv. 12 sq., or upon the words of Paul already

More
over, we may, since Resch's careful discussion of the whole sub
ject of the Agrapha (or extra-canonical sayings of Christ), with
considerable confidence assume that these words were handed
down to post-apostolic times not in an o gospel, nor
by mere oral tradition, but in the original Hebrew Matthew, of
which Papias and many others tell us, and which is probably to be
looked upon as a pre-canonical gospel, with the "Ur-Marcus" the
main source of our present gospels of Matthew and Luke, and
z/; rough the "Ur-Marcus" one . the sources of our present Gospel
of Mark. Looked upon in this light these words quoted by Dio
nysius become of great interest to us. They (or a part of the same
saying) are quoted more frequently by the Fathers than any other of
the Agrapha (Resch, on p. 116 sq. gives 69 instances).
Their in
terpretation, in connection with the words of Paul in 1 Thess. v.
21, 22, has been very satisfactorily discussed by Hänsel in the
Studien und Kritiken, 1836, p. 170 sq. They undoubtedly mean

According to Suicer (Thesaurus) all bishops in the
Occident as late as the fifth century were called Papae as a mark of
honor, and though the term by that time had begun to be used in
a distinctive sense of the bishop of Rome, the older usage continued
in parts of the West outside of Italy, until Gregory VII. (A.D.
1975) forbade the use of the name for any other than the pope. In
the East the word was used for a long time as the especial title of
the bishops of Alexandria and of Rome (see Suicer's Thesaurus
and Gieseler's Church //ist. Harper's cdition, I. p. 499).

Again, after treating the question thoroughly, he adds: "I have learned also that
this? is not a novel practice introduced in Africa
alone, but that even long ago in the times of the
bishops before us this opinion has been adopted
in the most populous churches, and in synods of
the brethren in Iconium and Synnada," and by
many others. To overturn their counsels and
throw them into strife and contention, I cannot
endure.

thy neighbor's landmark, which thy fathers have
set.' * x 10

His fourth epistle on baptism" was written to Dionysius" of Rome, who was then a
presbyter, but not long after received the epis
copate of that church.
It is evident from what
is stated of him by Dionysius of Alexandria,
that he also was a learned and admirable man.
Among other things he writes to him as follows
concerning Novatus:

"For with good reason do we feel hatred
toward Novatian," who has sundered the Church

teaching concerning God, and has calumniated
our most compassionate Lord Jesus Christ as
unmerciful. And besides all this he rejects the

* On Heraclas, see Bk. VI. chap. 3, note 2.
" Compare Cyprian's epistle to Quintus concerning the baptism
Cyprian there takes the position stated
of heretics (Ep. 70, al. 71).
here, that those who have been baptized in the Church and have
afterward gone over to heresy and then returned again to the Church
are not to be re-baptized, but to be received with the laying on of
hands only.
This of course does not at all invalidate the position
of Cyprian and the others who re-baptized heretics, for they bap
tized heretics not because they had been heretics, but because the
had not received true baptism, nor indeed any baptism at all, whic
it was impossible, in their view, for a heretic to give. They there
fore repudiated (as Cyprian does in the epistle referred to) the term
re-baptism, denying à. they re-baptized anybody.

those who had received baptism only at the hands of heretics stand

* Iconium was the principal city of Lycaonia, and Synnada a
city of Phrygia. The ...? of Iconium referred to here is men
tioned also by Firmilian in his epistle to Cyprian, §§ 7 and 19

From that epistle we learn that the
synod was attended by ão. from Phrygia, Cilicia, Galatia, and
other countries, and that heretical baptism was entirely rejected by
it.
Moreover, we learn that Firmilian himself was present at the
synod, and that it was held a considerable time before the writing
of his epistle.
This leads us to place the synod between 230 (on
Firmilian's dates, see above, Bk. VI. chap. 26, note 3) and 240 or
250.
Since it took place a considerable time before Firmilian wrote,
it can hardly have been held much later than 240. Of the synod of

* Aooroov. That Novatian re-baptized all those who came over
to him from the Church is stated by Cyprian in his epistle to Jubaia
nus, $ 2 (No. 72, al. 73).
His principle was similar to that which
later actuated the Donatists, namely, that baptism is valid only
when performed by priests of true and †. Christian character.
Renying, then, that those who defiled themselves and did despite to
God's holy Church by communing with the lapsed were true Chris
tians, he could not do otherwise than reject their baptism as quite
invalid.

* It was the custom from a very early period to cause the candi
date for baptism to go through a certain course of training of greater
or less length, and to require him to assent to a formulated state
ment of belief before the administration of the sacred rite. Thus we
learn from the Didache that even as early as the very beginning of
the second century the custom of pre-baptismal training was already
in vogue, and we know that by the third century the system of
catechetical instruction was a #i, developed thing, extending

then known as catechumens.
So far as a baptismal creed or con
session of faith is concerned, Caspari (see his great work, Studien
zur Gesch. des Taufsymbols) has shown that such a creed was in
use in the Roman church before the middle of the second century,
and that it formed the basis of what we know as the Apostles' Creed,
which in the form in which we have it is a later development.

Inasmuch as Novatian, so far as we can learn, was perfectly
orthodox on matters of faith, he would not have cared to make any
alteration in such a creed as the present Apostles' Creed.
Exactly
what Dionysius means in the present case is not certain. . It is pos.
sible that }. is simply speaking in general terms, assuming that if
Novatian does not accept the Church baptism, he must overturn and
pervert with it, the instruction which had preceded; or it may be
that he is thinking of that form of confession to which the candi
date was required to give his assent, according to Cyprian, EA. 69
(al. 7o): credis on wita in aeterna on et remissionema peccatorum
per sancta in ecclesian * " Dost thou believe in eternal life and
remission of sins through the holy Church?" The latter is the view
of Walesius, who is followed by all others that have discussed the
passage so far as I am aware. Of course Novatian could not put
the last clause of this question to his converts, and hence Dionysius
may have been thinking of this omission in using the words he does.
At the same time I confess myself unable to agree with others in

doubtful o, the question quoted above from Cyprian formed
an article in the baptismal confession of the Church in general.
It
does not appear in the Apostles' Creed, and can therefore hardly have
formed a part of the earlier Roman formula which underlay that.
And so far as I am aware there are no traces of the use of such an
article in the church of Alexandria. . In the second place, Dionysius'
language seems to me too general to admit of such a particular
application. Had he been thinking of one especial article of the
confession, as omitted or , altered by Novatian, he would, in my
opinion, have given some indication of it.
I am, therefore, inclined
to take his words in the most general sense, suggested as possible
just above.

He interprets

But
confess myself again unable to accept his interpretation. To me
the ao row seems not to refer to the laps?, to whom there has been
no direct reference in this fragment quoted by Eusebius, but rather
to Novatian's converts, to whom reference is made in the previous
sentence, and who are evidently in the mind of the writer in reser

the baptism of the Church, and the "faith and confession which pre
cede it," Novatian necessarily drove away from his converts the
Holy Spirit, who works in and through right confession and true
baptism. The meaning of the words "if, indeed, there was any
hope," &c., thus becomes very clear; Dionysius does not believe, of
course, that the Holy Spirit would remain with those who should
leave the Church to go with Novatian, but even if he should remain,
he would be driven entirely away from them when they blasphemed
him and denied his work, by rejecting the true baptism and submit
ting to another baptism without the Church.

i.e. his fifth epistle on the subject of baptism (see above, chap.

much against the heretics, he relates a certain
occurrence of his time as follows:

"For truly, brother, I am in need of counsel,
and I ask thy judgment concerning a certain
matter which has come to me, fearing that
I may be in error.
For one of the breth
ren that assemble, who has long been
considered a believer, and who, before my ordi
nation, and I think before the appointment of
the blessed Heraclas," was a member of the
congregation, was present with those who were
recently baptized.
And when he heard the
questions and answers," he came to me weeping,
and bewailing himself; and falling at my feet
he acknowledged and protested that the bap
tism with which he had been baptized among
the heretics was not of this character, nor in
any respect like this, because it was full of
impiety and blasphemy." And he said that
his soul was now pierced with sorrow, and
that he had not confidence to lift his eyes to
God, because he had set out from those impi

besought that he might receive this most per
fect purification, and reception and grace.
But I did not dare to do this ; and said
that his long communion was sufficient for
this.
For I should not dare to renew from the
beginning one who had heard the giving of
thanks and joined in repeating the Amen; who
had stood by the table and had stretched forth
his hands to receive the blessed food ; and who
had received it, and partaken for a long while
of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
But I exhorted him to be of good courage, and
to approach the partaking of the saints with
firm faith and good hope.
But he does not
cease lamenting, and he shudders to ap
proach the table, and scarcely, though entreated,
does he dare to be present at the prayers.""

, note 6). The sixth, likewise addressed to Xystus, is mentioned
low in § 6.
* On Xystus II. of Rome, see chap 5, note 5.
* On Heraclas, see above, Bk. VI. chap. 3, note 2.
* See the previous chapter, note 3.
* The reference here, of course, is not to the Novatians, because
this old man, who had been a regular attendant upon the orthodox
Church since the time of Heraclas, if not before, had been bap
tized by the heretics long before Novatian arose. The epistle seems
to contain no reference to Novatian; at least, the sragment which
we have is dealing with an entirely different subject.

• Dittrich finds in this epistle an evidence that IOionysius was
not sully convinced of the advisability of re-baptizing converts from
heretical bodies, that he wavered in fact between the Eastern and
the Roman practices, but I am unable to see that the epistle implies
anything | the kind.
It is not that he doubts the necessity of re
baptism in ordinary cases, - he is not discussing that subject at all,
-the question is, does long communion itself take the place of bap
tism; lo not a man, unwittingly baptized, gain through such com
munion the grace from the Spirit which is ordinarily conveyed in
baptism, and might not the rite of baptism at so late a date be an
insult to the Spirit, who might have been working through the saw -
rament of the eucharist during all these years?
It is this question
which Dionysius desires to have Xystus assist him in answering -
a question which has nothing to do, in Dionysius' mind, with the
validity or non-validity of heretical baptism, for it will be noticed
that he does not base his refusal to baptize the man upon the fact
that he has already been baptized, partially, or imperfectly, or in
any other way, but solely upon the fact that he has for so long been
partaking of the eucharist.

It is wonderful that both of
these things occurred under Valerian ; and
it is the more remarkable in this case when we
consider his previous conduct, for he had been
mild and friendly toward the men of God, for
none of the emperors before him had treated
them so kindly and favorably; and not even
those who were said openly to be Christians"
received them with such manifest hospitality and
friendliness as he did at the beginning of his
reign.

speak with certainty as to the identity of the one referred to here.
But it may perhaps be suggested that the well-known Carthaginian
Confessor is meant, who caused Cyprian so much trouble by grant
ing letters of pardon indiscriminately to the lapsed, in defiance of
regular custom and of Cyprian's authority (see Cyprian: /Ep. 16,

If this be the Lucian referred

upon which they were to be received again into the Church. That
the epistle did not, like the one mentioned just before, have to do

the counsels of the sinful demons. And he in
duced him to practice initiations and abominable
sorceries and to offer unacceptable sacrifices;
to slay innumerable children and to sacrifice
the offspring of unhappy fathers; to divide the
bowels of new-born babes and to mutilate and
cut to pieces the creatures of God, as if by such
practices they could attain happiness."

He adds to this the following: "Splendid
indeed were the thank-offerings which Mac
rianus brought them' for the empire which was
the object of his hopes. He is said to have
been formerly the emperor's general finance
minister*; yet he did nothing praiseworthy or
of general benefit," but fell under the pro

to the highest position in the army and made his chief counselor.
Dionysius is the only one to tell us that he was the chief of the
Egyptian magicians.
Gibbon doubts the statement, but Macrianus
may well have been an Egyptian by birth and devoted, as so many
of the Egyptians were, to arts of magic, and have gained power over
Valerian in this way which he could have gained in no other.
It is
not necessary of course to understand Dionysius' words as implying
that Macrianus was officially at the head of the body of Egyptian
magicians, but simply that he was the greatest, or one of the greatest,
of them. He figures in our other sources simply as a military and
olitical character, but it was natural for Dionysius to emphasize
|. addiction to magic, though he could hardly have done it had
Macrianus' practices in this respect not been commonly known.
* The persecution which the Christians suffered under Valerian
was more terrible than any other except that of Diocletian. Numer
ous calamities took place during his reign. The barbarians were
constantly invading and ravaging the borders of the empire, and on
the east §. Persians did great damage. Still worse was the terrible
plague which had begun in the reign of Decius and raged for about
fifteen years. All these galamities aroused the religious fears of the
emperor.
Dionysius tells us that he was induced by Macrianus to
have recourse to human sacrifices and other similar means of pene
trating the events of the suture, and when these rites sailed, the
presence of Christians-irreligious men hated by the gods-in the
imperial family was urged as the reason for the failure, and thus the
hostility of the emperor was aroused against all Christians. As a
consequence an edict was published in 257 requiring all persons to
conform at least outwardly to the religion of Rome on the penalty
of exile. And at the same time the Christians were prohibited from
holding religious services, upon pain of death.
In 258 followed a
rescript of terrible severity. Only the clergy and the higher ranks
of the laity were attacked, but they were sentenced to death is they
refused to repent, and the clergy, apparently, whether they repented
or not. The persecution continued until Valerian's captivity, which
took place probably late in 26o. The dates during this period are very
uncertain, !. Dionysius' statement that the persecution continued
forty-two months is probably not far out of the way; from late in the
}. 257 to the year 261, when it was brought to an end by Gallienus.
n Egypt and the Orient the persecution seems to have continued
a few months longer than elsewhere (see chap. 13, note 3). The
martyrs were very numerous during the Valerian persecution, espe
cially in Rome and Africa. The most noted were Cyprian and
§o II. On the details of the persecution, see Tillemont, H. E.

have been the highest civil position in the empire (cf. Valesius'
note ad docum). Gibbon calls him Praetorian Prefect, and since he
was the most famous of Valerian's generals, he doubtless held that
position also, though I am not aware that any of our sources state
that he did.

The result was that by Macrianus' "weak or wicked counsels the
imperial army was betrayed into a situation where valor and military
Dionysius, in chap. 23,

below, directly states that Macrianus betrayed Valerian, and Hi, 1s
the view of the case commonly taken.
Valerian fell into the hands
of the Persians (late in 260 A.D.), and Macrianus was proclaimed
emperor by his troops, and on account of his lameness (as both
Dionysius and Zonaras put it) or his age, associated with him his
two sons, Quietus and Macrianus.
After some months he left his
son Quietus in charge of Syria, and designing to make himself
master of the Occident, marched with his son Macrianus against
Gallienus, but was met in Illyrium by the Pretender Aureolus (262)
and defeated, and both himself and son slain.
His son Quietus
meanwhile was besieged in Edessa by the Pretender Odenathus and
slain.

to the easier reading, ruxet.
Although it seems harder, it is really
sully in accord with what has preceded. . Macrianus had not made
himself emperor (if Dionysius is to be believed), but he had suc
ceeded fully in his desires, in that he had raised his sons to the
purple.
If he had acquired such power as to be able to do that, he
must have given them the position, because he preferred to govern
in that way; and is that be so, he could hardly be said to have failed
in his desires.

CHAPTER XI.

The Events which happened at this Zime to
Dionysius and those in Egypt.

l

BUT as regards the persecution which
prevailed so fiercely in his reign, and the
sufferings which Dionysius with others endured
on account of piety toward the God of the uni
verse, his own words shall show, which he wrote
in answer to Germanus,' a contemporary bishop
who was endeavoring to slander him.
His
statement is as follows:

"Truly I am in danger of falling into
being

great folly and stupidity through
forced to relate the wonderful providence of
God toward us.
But since it is said " that "it is
good to keep close the secret of a king, but it
is honorable to reveal the works of God," I will
join issue with the violence of Germanus.
I went not alone to AEmilianus;* but my
fellow-presbyter, Maximus," and the dea
cons Faustus," Eusebius,' and Chaeremon," and
a brother who was present from Rome,
went with me.

first say to me: ‘Hold no assemblies; '"

& Tob. xii. 7.
* This AEmilianus, prefect of Egypt, under whom the persecu
tion was carried on in Alexandria during Valerian's reign, later,
during the reign of Gallienus, was induced (or compelled) by the
troops of Alexandria to revolt against Gallienus, and assume the
purple himself. He was defeated, however, by Theodotus, Gal
lienus' general, and was put to death in prison, in what year we do
not know. Cf. 'fillemont's #os on A. iii. p. 342 sq.

* Maximus is mentioned a number of times in this chapter in
connection with the persecution.
After the death of Dionysius he
succeeded him as bishop of Alexandria, and as such is referred to
below, in chaps. 28, 30, and 32.
For the dates of his episcopate,
see chap. 28, note to.

• On Faustus, see above, Bk. VI. chap. 40, note to.
7 In regard to this deacon Eusebius, who later became bishop of

Laodicea, see chap. 32, note 12.

* Chaeremon is mentioned three times in the present chapter, but

we have no other reliable information in regard to him.

* We may gather from $ 11, below, that Germanus had accused
Dionysius of neglecting to hold the customary assemblies, and of
seeking safety by flight.
Walesius, in his note ad docum, remarks,
"Dionysius was accused by Germanus of neglecting to hold the
assemblies of the brethren before the beginning of the persecution,
and of providing for his own safety by slight.
For as often as per
secution arose the bishops were accustomed first to convene the
people, that they might cyhort them to hold fast to their faith in
Christ. Then they baptized infants and catechumens, that they
might not depart this life without baptism, and they gave the
eucharist to the faithful, because they did not know how long the
persecution might last."
Valesius refers for confirmation of his
statements to an epistle sent to Pope Hormisdas, by Germanus and
others, in regard to Dorotheus, bishop of Thessalonica (circa A.D.
519).
I have not been able to verify the reference. The custom
mentioned by Walesius is certainly a most natural one, and there
fore Walesius' statements are very likely quite true, though there
seems to be little direct testimony upon which to rest them.

But listen to the very words which were
spoken on both sides, as they were re

corded :

"Dionysius, Faustus, Maximus, Marcellus,"
and Chaeremon being arraigned, Aemilianus the
prefect said: "I have reasoned verbally with you
concerning the clemency which our rulers
have shown to you; for they have given
you the opportunity to save yourselves, if
you will turn to that which is according to
nature, and worship the gods that preserve their
empire, and forget those that are contrary to
For
nature." What then do you say to this?
I do not think that you will be ungrateful for
their kindness, since they would turn you to
a better course.'
Dionysius replied: "Not
all people worship all gods; but each one
those whom he approves. We therefore rever
ence and worship the one God, the Maker of
all; who hath given the empire to the divinely
favored and august Valerian and Gallienus; and
we pray to him continually for their em
pire, that it may remain unshaken.' AFmil
ianus, the prefect, said to them : "But who
forbids you to worship him, if he is a god, to
gether with those who are gods by nature.
For
ye have been commanded to reverence the gods,
Dionysius
and the gods whom all know.'
answered : "We worship no other." AFmilia
nus, the prefect, said to them : ‘I see that
you are at once ungrateful, and insensible to the
kindness of our sovereigns.
Wherefore ye shall
not remain in this city.
But ye shall be sent
into the regions of Libya, to a place called
Cephro.

command of our sovereigns, and it shall by no

clear, both on account of the Beous just preceding, and also in view
of the fact that in § 9 we have the phrase row rară (bua ow be ov. A
contrast, therefore, is drawn in the present casc between the gods

"And he hastened me away, though I was
sick, not granting even a day's respite. What
opportunity then did I have, either to hold as
semblies, or not to hold them?""

Farther on he says: "But through the
help of the Lord we did not give up the
open assembly.
But I called together the more
diligently those who were in the city, as if I
were with them ; being, so to speak," "absent in
body but present in spirit.'"
But in Cephro a
large church gathered with us of the brethren
that followed us from the city, and those that
joined us from Egypt; and there "God
opened unto us a door for the Word." At
first we were persecuted and stoned; but
afterwards not a few of the heathen forsook the
idols and turned to God.
For until this time
they had not heard the Word, since it was
then first sown by us. And as if God had
brought us to them for this purpose, when
we had performed this ministry he transferred
us to another place.
For AEmilianus, as it ap
peared, desired to transport us to rougher and
more Libyan-like places; " so he commanded
them to assemble from all quarters in Mareotis,"
and assigned to them different villages through
out the country. But he ordered us to be placed
nearer the highway that we might be seized first."
For evidently he arranged and prepared matters
so that whenever he wished to seize us he

Libya was an ićfinite term among
the ancients for that part of Africa which included the Great Desert
and all the unexplored country lying west and south of it.
Almost
nothing was known about the Country, and the desert and the regions
beyond were peopled by the fancy with all sorts of terrible monsters,
and were looked upon as the theater of the most dire forces, natu
ral and supernatural.
As a consequence, the term " Libyan "
became a synonym for all that was most disagreeable and dreadful
in nature.

* Marcotis, or Mareia, or Maria, was one of the land districts
into which Egypt was divided. A lake, a town situated on the shore
of the lake, and the district in which they lay, all bore the same
name. The district Marcotis lay just south of Alexandria, but did
not include it, for Alexandria and Ptolemais formed an independent
sphere of administration sharply separated from the thirty-six, land
districts of the country. Cf. Bk. II. chap. 17, notes 10 and 12, above.
Mommsen (Roman Provinces, Scribner's ed. Vol. II. p. 255) re
marks that these land districts, like the cities, became the basis of
episcopal dioceses.
This we should expect to be the case, but I am
not aware that we can prove it to have been regularly so, at any
rate not during the earlier centuries.

THE SUFFERINGS OF DIONYSIUS.

3O I

who were present know how I was affected.
For here I will accuse myself. At first I was
grieved and greatly disturbed ; for though
these places were better known and more familiar
to us, yet the country was said to be destitute
of brethren and of men of character, and to be
exposed to the annoyances of travelers and
But I was comforted
incursions of robbers.
when the brethren reminded me that it was
nearer the city, and that while Cephro afforded
us much intercourse with the brethren from
Egypt, so that we were able to extend the
Church more widely, as this place was nearer
the city we should enjoy more frequently the
sight of those who were truly beloved and most
closely related and dearest to us.
For they
would come and remain, and special meetings"
could be held, as in the more remote suburbs.
And thus it turned out."

After other matters he writes again as fol
lows of the things which happened to him :
"Germanus indeed boasts of many confes
sions. He can speak forsooth of many
adversities which he himself has endured.
But
is he able to reckon up as many as we can, of
sentences, confiscations, proscriptions, plunder
ing of goods, loss of dignities, contempt of
worldly glory, disregard for the flatteries of gov
ernors and of councilors, and patient endur
ance of the threats of opponents, of outcries, of
perils and persecutions, and wandering and dis
tress, and all kinds of tribulation, such as came
upon me under Decius and Sabinus," and such

account is there of him P
But I turn from
this great folly into which I am falling on
account of Germanus. And for the same reason
I desist from giving to the brethren who know it
an account of everything which took place."
The same writer also in the epistle to
Domitius and Didymus" mentions some

particulars of the persecution as follows: "As
our people are many and unknown to you, it
would be superfluous to give their names; but
understand that men and women, young and
old, maidens and matrons, soldiers and civilians,
of every race and age, some by scourging and
fire, others by the sword, have conquered in

in the case of some a very long time was
not sufficient to make them appear acceptable
to the Lord ; as, indeed, it seems also in my
own case, that sufficient time has not yet elapsed.
Wherefore he has retained me for the time which
he knows to be fitting, saying, "In an acceptable
time have I heard thee, and in a day of
salvation have I helped thee." For as you
have inquired of our affairs and desire us to
tell you how we are situated, you have heard
fully that when we - that is, myself and Gaius and
Faustus and Peter and Paul" - were led away as
prisoners by a centurion and magistrates, with
their soldiers and servants, certain persons from
Mareotis came and dragged us away by force,
as we were unwilling to follow them." But
now I and Gaius and Peter are alone, de
prived of the other brethren, and shut up in
a desert and dry place in Libya, three days'
journey from Paraetonium."

He says farther on : "The presbyters,
Maximus," Dioscorus," Demetrius, and Lu
cius * concealed themselves in the city, and
visited the brethren secretly; for Faustinus and
Aquila," who are more prominent in the world,

seems to have been a town, possibly a section of country in the
district of Mareotis.
Nicephorus spells the word with a single 1,

rived from Colutho, which was not an uncommon name in Egypt
(see Valesius' note ad locum).

passage is sufficient to warrant Valesius' conclusion, that in the time
of Dionysius there was but one church in Alexandria, where the
brethren met for worship.
It may have been so, but the words do
not appear to indicate, as Valesius thinks they do, that matters were
in a different state then from that which existed in the time of
Athanasius, who, in his Apology to Constantius, $ 1.4 sq., expressly
speaks of a number of church †: in Alexandria.

* Sabinus has been already mentioned in Bk. VI. chap. 40, § 2,
from which passage we may gather that he held the same position
under Decius which Aemilianus held under Valerian (see note 3 on
the chapter referred to).
* We learn from chap. 20, below, that this epistle to Domitius
and Didymus was one of É. regular festal epistles (for there
is no ground for assuming that a different epistle is referred to in
that 3. Domitius and Didymus are otherwise unknown per
Eusebius evidently (as we can see both from this chapter
sonages.
and from chapter 20) supposes this epistle to refer to the persecution,

of which Dionysius has been speaking in that portion of his epistle
to Germanus quoted in this chapter; namely, to the persecution of
Valerian.
But he is clearly mistaken in this supposition; for, as we
can see from a comparison of § 22, below, with Bk. VI. chap. 40,
§ 6 sq., Dionysius is referring in this epistle to the same persecution
to which he referred in that chapter; namely, to the persecution of
Decius.
But the present epistle was written (as we learn from $ 23)
while this same persecution was still going on, and, therefore, some
years before the time of Valerian's persecution, and before the
writing of the epistle to Germanus (see Bk. VI. chap. 4o, note 2),

of whom he speaks as being then a presby
ter, succeeded Dionysius himself as bishop of
Alexandria."
But the Faustus who was with
him, and who at that time was distinguished for
his confession, was preserved until the persecu
tion in our day," when being very old and full
of days, he closed his life by martyrdom, being
beheaded.
But such are the things which hap
pened at that time * to Dionysius.

CHAPTER XII.

The Martyrs in Casarea in Palestine.

DURING the above-mentioned persecution under
Valerian, three men in Caesarea in Palestine, be
ing conspicuous in their confession of Christ, were
adorned with divine martyrdom, becoming food
for wild beasts. One of them was called Priscus,
another Malchus, and the name of the third was
Alexander." They say that these men, who lived
in the country, acted at first in a cowardly man
ner, as if they were careless and thoughtless.
For when the opportunity was given to those
who longed for the prize with heavenly desire,
they treated it lightly, lest they should seize the
crown of martyrdom prematurely.
But having
deliberated on the matter, they hastened to Caes
area, and went before the judge and met the end
we have mentioned. They relate that besides
these, in the same persecution and the same city,
a certain woman endured a similar conflict. But
it is reported that she belonged to the sect of
Marcion."

* See below, chap. 32, § 5.
* See chap. 28, note 8.
* That is, until the persecution of Diocletian, A.D. 303 sq.
* That is, according to Eusebius, in the time of Valerian, but
only the events related in the first part of the chapter took place at
that time; those recorded in the epistle to Domitius and Didymus in
the time of Decius.

See above, note 25.

* Of these three men we know only what is told us in this chapter.
* Marcionitic martyrs are mentioned by Eusebius in Bk. IV.
chap. 15, and in Martyrs of Pal. chap. Io.
In 17. E. V. 16, it is
stated that the Marcionites as well as the Montanists had many
martyrs, but that the orthodox Christians did not acknowledge them
as Christians, and would not recognize them even when they were
martyred together. Of course they were all alike Christians in the
eyes of the state, and hence all o subject to persecution.

CHAPTER XIII.

The Peace under Gallienus.

SHORTLy after this Valerian was reduced
to slavery by the barbarians," and his son
having become sole ruler, conducted the gov
ernment more prudently. He immediately re
strained the persecution against us by public
proclamations," and directed the bishops to per
form in freedom their customary duties, in a
rescript" which ran as follows:

"The Emperor Caesar Publius Licinius
Gallienus, Pius, Felix, Augustus," to Diony
sius, Pinnas, Demetrius," and the other bishops.
I have ordered the bounty of my gift to be de
clared through all the world, that they may
depart from the places of religious worship."
And for this purpose you may use this copy of
my rescript, that no one may molest you. And
this which you are now enabled lawfully to do,
has already for a long time been conceded by
me."
Therefore Aurelius Cyrenius," who is the
chief administrator of affairs," will observe this
ordinance which I have given."

bishops which he quotes shows that they did more than simply put
a stop to the persecution, - that they in fact made Christianity a

the usurper Macrianus (i.e. late in 261 or early in 262), during the
time of whose usurpation the benefits of Gallienus' edicts of tolera

succeeded him. He also was a member of Ori

So far

but his predecessor, Theoctistus, was still bishop in the time of
Stephen of Rome (254-257; see above, Bk. VI. chap. 19, note 27),
while he himself became bishop before the death of Xystus of Rome,
as we may gather from this chapter, i.e. before August, 258 (see
chap. 5, note 5), so that between these dates his accession must
be placed.
Eusebius' words in this passage will hardly admit an
episcopate of more than one or two years; possibly he was bishop
but a few months.

* The dates of Theotecnus are likewise uncertain.

Eusebius in
Bk. VII. chap. 32, says that he was acquainted with Pamphilus
during the episcopate of Agapius (the successor of Theotecnus),
implying that he first made his acquaintance then.
It is therefore
likely that Agapius became bishop some years before the persecu
tion of Diocletian, sor otherwise we hardly allow enough time for
the acquaintance of Pamphilus and Eusebius who did so much work
Pamphilus
together, and apparently were friends for so long a time.

prominent man and was present at the two Antiochian synods men

* On Mazabanes, see Bk. VI, chap. 39, note 5.
* According to the Chron. of Eusebius, Hymenaeus was bishop
of Jerusalem from 265-298.
It is expressly stated in the Chron.
that the dates of the earlier Jerusalem bishops are not known (see
Bk. V. chap. 12, note 1); but with the dates of the bishops of the
latter part of the third century Eusebius can hardly have been
unacquainted, and that Hymenaeus, was bishop at any rate as
early as 265 is proved by chaps. 27 and 30 (see the note on Maza
banes referred to just above). The dates given in the Chron. may
therefore be accepted as at least approximately correct.

CHAPTER XV.

The Martyrdom of Marinus at Caesarea.

At this time, when the peace of the
restored,

churches had been everywhere
Marinus in Caesarea in Palestine, who was hon
ored for his military deeds, and illustrious by
virtue of family and wealth, was beheaded for
his testimony to Christ, on the following
account.
The vine-branch * is a certain
mark of honor among the Romans, and
those who obtain it become, they say, centurions.
A place being vacated, the order of succession
called Marinus to this position.
But when he
was about to receive the honor, another person
came before the tribunal and claimed that it
was not legal, according to the ancient laws, for
him to receive the Roman dignity, as he was a
Christian and did not sacrifice to the emperors;
but that the office belonged rather to him.
Thereupon the judge, whose name was
Achaeus," being disturbed, first asked what
opinion Marinus held. And when he perceived
that he continually confessed himself a Christian,
he gave him three hours for reflection.
When he came out from the tribunal, Theotecnus," the bishop there, took him aside
and conversed with him, and taking his hand
led him into the church. And standing with
him within, in the sanctuary, he raised his cloak
a little, and pointed to the sword that hung by
his side; and at the same time he placed before
him the Scripture of the divine Gospels, and
told him to choose which of the two he wished.
And without hesitation he reached forth his right
hand, and took the divine Scripture. "Hold
fast then," says Theotecnus to him, "hold fast
to God, and strengthened by him mayest thou
obtain what thou hast chosen, and go in
peace."
Immediately on his return the
herald cried out calling him to the tribunal,
for the appointed time was already completed.
And standing before the tribunal, and manifest
ing greater zeal for the faith, immediately, as he
was, he was led away and finished his course by
death.

* The martyrdom of Marinus after the promulgation of Gallienus'
edict of toleration and after peace had been, as Eusebius remarks.
everywhere restored to the churches, has caused historians some
difficulty. . It is maintained, however, by Tillemont and others, and
with especial force by Görres in the 7as rächer/ir Arct. Thros.,
1877, p. 62o sq., that the martyrdom of Marinus took place while
the usurper Macrianus, who was exceedingly hostile to the Chris
tians, was still in power in the East, and at a time, therefore, when
the edicts of Gallienus could have no force there.
This of course
explains the difficulty completely. The martyrdom then must have
taken place toward o beginning of Gallienus' reign, for Macrianus
was slain as early as 262. Of the martyr Marinus we know only
what Eusebius tells us here.

* to KAmua. The centurion received as a badge of office a vine

branch or vine-switch, which was called by the Romans l'rt's.

* Achaeus is an otherwise unknown person. That he was gov
ernor of Palestine, as Walesius asserts, is apparently a pure assump
tion, for the term used of him (&xaort is) is quite indefinite.

ASTYRIUs" also is commemorated on account of
his pious boldness in connection with this affair.
He was a Roman of senatorial rank, and in favor
with the emperors, and well known to all on
account of his noble birth and wealth.
Being
present at the martyr's death, he took his body
away on his shoulder, and arraying him in a
splendid and costly garment, prepared him for
the grave in a magnificent manner, and gave
him fitting burial."
The friends of this man
that remain to our day, relate many other facts
concerning him.

CHAPTER XVII.

The Signs at Paneas of the Great Might of our
Saviour.

AMONG these is also the following wonder.
At Caesarea Philippi, which the Phoenicians call
Paneas, springs are shown at the foot of the
Mountain Panius, out of which the Jordan flows.
They say that on a certain feast day, a victim
was thrown in," and that through the power of
the demon it marvelously disappeared and that
which happened was a famous wonder to those
who were present.
Astyrius was once there
when these things were done, and seeing the
multitude astonished at the affair, he pitied their
delusion; and looking up to heaven he suppli
cated the God over all through Christ, that he
would rebuke the demon who deceived the peo
ple, and bring the men's delusion to an end.
And they say that when he had prayed thus,
immediately the sacrifice floated on the surface
of the fountain.
And thus the miracle de
parted ; and no wonder was ever afterward per
formed at the place.

* We know nothing more about this Astyrius than is recorded
here.
Rufinus, in his H. E. VII. 13, tells us that he suffered mar
tyrdom at about this time; but Eusebius says nothing of the kind,
and it is therefore not at all probable that Rufinus is correct. He
probably concluded, from Eusebius' account of him, that he also
suffered martyrdom.

* Burton and Cruse close the chapter at this point, throwing the
next sentence into chap. 17. Such a transposition, however, is
unnecessary, and I have preferred to follow Valesius, Heinichen,
Schwegler, and other editors, in dividing as above.

* Caesarea Philippi (to be distinguished from Caesarea, the chief
city of Palestine, mentioned in previous chapters) was originally
called Paneas by the Greeks, - a name which it retained even after
the name Caesarea Philippi had been given it by Philip the Tetrarch,
who enlarged and beautified it. The place, which is now a small
village, is called Banias by the Arabs. It lies at the base of Mt.
Hermon, and is noted for one of the principal sources of the Jordan,
which issues from springs beneath the rooks of Mt. Hermon at this
point. The spot is said to be remarkably beautiful.
See Robin
son's Bio/ical Researches in Palestone, Vol. III. p. 409 sq.

victims into their sacred wells and sountains, and that therefore

SINCE I have mentioned this city I do
not think it proper to omit an account

they say that the woman with an issue of blood,
who, as we learn from the sacred Gospel," re
ceived from our Saviour deliverance from her
affliction, came from this place, and that her
house is shown in the city, and that remarkable
memorials of the kindness of the Saviour
to her remain there. For there stands upon
an elevated stone, by the gates of her
house, a brazen image of a woman kneeling, with
her hands stretched out, as if she were pray
ing.
Opposite this is another upright image of
a man, made of the same material, clothed
decently in a double cloak, and extending his
hand toward the woman.
At his feet, beside
is a certain strange plant,
the statue itself,"
which climbs up to the hem of the brazen cloak,
and is a remedy for all kifids of diseases.
They say that this statue is an image of
Jesus.
It has remained to our day, so that
we ourselves also saw it when we were stay
ing in the city. Nor is it strange that those
of the Gentiles who, of old, were benefited
by our Saviour, should have done such things,
since we have learned also that the likenesses of
his apostles Paul and Peter, and of Christ him
self, are preserved in paintings," the ancients
being accustomed, as it is likely, according to a
habit of the Gentiles, to pay this kind of honor
indiscriminately to those regarded by them as
deliverers.

"This account of the statue erected by the woman with the issue
of blood is, repeated by many later writers, and Sozomen (H. E.
V. 21) and Philostorgius (H. E. VII. 3) inform us that it was
Gieseler remarks (Eccles. Hist.,

the memorial had been erected in honor of an emperor (probably
Hadrian), and falsely interpreted by the Christians, o s on
account of a gorno, or 65% appearing in the inscription."
ere
can be no doubt of Eusebius' honesty in the matter, but no less
doubt that the statue commemorated something quite different from
that which, Christian tradition claimed. Upon this whole chapter,
see Heinichen's Excursus, in Vol. III. p. 698 sq.

* See Matt. ix. 20 sq.
* ot, mapá rois mooiv Smi tos arij}\ms atros. This is commonly
translated "at his feet, upon the pedestal"; but, as Heinichen
remarks, in the excursus referred to just above, the plant can hardly
have grown upon the pedestal, and what is more, we have no war
rant for translating arman "pedestal."
Paulus, in his commentary
on Matthew in loco, maintains that Eusebius is speaking only of a
representation upon the base of the statue, not jo. actual plant.
But this interpretation, as Heinichen shows, is quite unwarranted.
For the use of &mi in the sense of "near" or "beside," we have
numerous examples (see the instances given by Heinichen, and also
Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon, s.r.o.).

* Eusebius himself, as we learn from his letter to the Empress
Constantia Augusta (see above, p. 44), did not approve of the use
of images or representations of Christ, on the ground that it tended
to idolatry.
In consequence of this disapproval he fell into great
disrepute in the later image-worshiping Church, his epistle bein
cited by the iconoclasts at the ...]". of Nicaea, in 787, an
his orthodoxy being in consequence fiercely attacked by the defend
ers of image-worship, who dominated the council, and won the day.

CHAPTER XIX.

The Episcopal Chair of James.

THE chair of James, who first received the
episcopate of the church at Jerusalem from the
Saviour himself' and the apostles, and who, as
the divine records show," was called a brother
of Christ, has been preserved until now," the
brethren who have followed him in succession
there exhibiting clearly to all the reverence
which both those of old times and those of our
own day maintained and do maintain for holy
men on account of their piety. So much as to
this matter.

universal tradition that James was bishop of Jerusalem, see above,

* See Gal. i. 19. On the actual relationship of "James, the

Brother of the Lord" to Christ, see Bk. I. chap. 12, note 14.

* There can be no doubt that a chair (8povos), said to be the
episcopal seat of James, the first bishop of Jerusalem, was shown in
that church in the time of Eusebius, but there can be no less doubt
that it was not genuine. Even had James been bishop of Jerusalem,
and possessed a regular episcopal chair, or throne (a very violent
supposition, which involves a most glaring anachronism), it was
uite out of the question that it should have been preserved from
loss at the fall of the city in 70 A.D. . As Stroth drily re
marks: "Man hatte auch wohl nichts wichtigeres zu retten, als
einen Stuhl ' " The beginning of that veneration of relics which
later took such strong hold on the Church, and which still flourishes
within the Greek and Roman communions is clearly seen in this
case recorded by Eusebius. At the same time, we can hardly say
that that superstitious veneration with which we are acquainted
appeared in this case.
There seems to be nothing more than the
customary respect for an article of old and time-honored associations
which is seen everywhere and in all ages (cf. Heinichen's Excur
sus on this passage, Vol. III. p. 208 sq.). Cruse has unaccountably
rendered 8pévos in this passage as if it referred to the see of Jerusa
It is plain enough that such an

interpretation is quite unwarranted.

Eusebius mentions or quotes from his epistles.

* Eusebius supposes all of these epistles to have been written in
the time of Valerian or Gallienus; but he is mistaken, at least so far
as the epistle to Domitius and Didymus is concerned (see above,
chap. 11, note 25), and possibly in regard to some of the others
also.

* ras bepowevas opraa'rikas.

It was the custom for the bishops
of Alexandria to write every year before Easter a sort of epistle, or
homily, and in it to announce the time of the festival. These writings
thus received the name Festal or Festival Epistles or Homilies (see
Suicer's Thesar, rus s.7. to a raortrós, and Valesius' note ad locz, m).
This is apparently the earliest mention of such epistles.
Others are
to by Eusebius in chaps. 21 and 22, as written by Dionysius
rese
to various persons.
Undoubtedly all the Alexandrian bishops dur
ing these centuries wrote such epistles, but none are extant, so far
as I am aware, except a number by Athanasius (extant only in a
Syriac version, published in Syriac and English by Cureton in 1846
and 1843), a few by Theophilus (extant "'<! Latin), and thirty
by Cyril (published in Migne's Patr. Gr. LXXVII. 391 sq.).

him is no longer extant.

to Domitius and Didymus," in which he sets
forth a canon of eight years," maintaining that it
is not proper to observe the paschal feast until
after the vernal equinox.
Besides these he sent
another epistle to his fellow-presbyters in Alex
andria, as well as various others to different per
sons while the persecution was still prevailing.'

CHAPTER XXI.

The Occurrences as A/exandria.

PEACE had but just been restored when
he returned to Alexandria;' but as sedition
and war broke out again, rendering it impossible
for him to oversee all the brethren, separated
in different places by the insurrection, at the
feast of the passover, as if he were still an exile
from Alexandria, he addressed them again
by letter." And in another festal epistle
written later to Hierax," a bishop in Egypt,
he mentions the sedition then prevailing in Alex
andria, as follows:

"What wonder is it that it is difficult for me
to communicate by letters with those who live
far away, when it is beyond my power even to
reason with myself, or to take counsel for
Truly I need to send letters

to those who are as my own bowels," dwell
ing in one home, and brethren of one soul, and
citizens of the same church ; but how to send
them I cannot tell.
For it would be easier
for one to go, not only beyond the limits of
the province, but even from the East to the
West, than from Alexandria to Alexandria itself.

* On Domitius and Didymus, and the epistle addressed to them,
Eusebius quotes from the epistle in

see above, chap. 11, note 25.
that chapter.
" That is, an eight-year cycle for the purpose of determining the
time of the full moon. o: had employed the old eight-year
cycle, but had, as he thought, improved it W combining two in a
single sixteen-year cycle (see above, Bk. VI. chap. 22), as was
done also by the author of the so-called Cyprianic Chronicle at the
middle of the third century. The more accurate nineteen-year Me
tonic cycle (already in use among the Greeks in the fifth century B.C.)
had not come into general use in the Church until later than this
time. The Nicene Council sanctioned it and gave it wide currency,
but it had apparently not yet come into use in the Church.
In fact,
the first Christian to make use of it for the computation of Easter,
so far as we know, was Anatolius of Alexandria, later bishop of
Laodicea (see below, chap. 32, § 14).
It was soon adopted in the
Alexandrian church, and already in the time of Athanasius had
become the basis of all Easter calculations, as we can gather from
Athanasius' Festal Epistles. From about the time of the Nicene
Council on, Alexandria was commonly looked to for the reckoning
of the date of Easter, and although an older and less accurate cycle
remained in use in the West for a long time, the nineteen-year cycle
gradually won its way everywhere.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[VII. 21.

For the very heart of the city is more intri
cate and impassable than that great and
trackless desert which Israel traversed for two
generations.
And our smooth and waveless
harbors have become like the sea, divided and
walled up, through which Israel drove and in
whose highway the Egyptians were overwhelmed.
For often from the slaughters there commit
ted they appear like the Red Sea. And
the river which flows by the city has some
times seemed drier than the waterless desert,
and more parched than that in which Israel, as
they passed through it, so suffered for thirst,
that they cried out against Moses, and the water
flowed
for them from the steep rock,"
through him who alone doeth wonders. Again
it has overflowed so greatly as to flood all
the surrounding country, and the roads and the
fields; threatening to bring back the deluge of
water that occurred in the days of Noah. And
it flows along, polluted always with blood and
slaughter and drownings, as it became for Pha
raoh through the agency of Moses, when he
changed it into blood, and it stank." And
what other water could purify the water
which purifies everything?
How could the
ocean, so great and impassable for men, if poured
into it, cleanse this bitter sea P Or how could
the great river which flowed out of Eden, if it
poured the four heads into which it is divided
into the one of Geon,' wash away this pollu
tion? Or when can the air poisoned by
these noxious exhalations become pure?
For such vapors arise from the earth, and winds
from the sea, and breezes from the river, and
mists from the harbors, that the dews are, as it
were, discharges from dead bodies putrefy
ing in all the elements around us. Yet men
wonder and cannot understand whence these
continuous pestilences; whence these severe
sicknesses; whence these deadly diseases of all
kinds; whence this various and vast human
destruction; why this great city no longer con
tains as many inhabitants, from tender infants
to those most advanced in life, as it formerly
contained of those whom it called hearty old
men.
But the men from forty to seventy years
of age were then so much more numerous that
their number cannot now be filled out, even
when those from fourteen to eighty years are
enrolled and registered for the public allow
ance of food. And the youngest in appear
ance have become, as it were, of equal age
with those who formerly were the oldest.

CHAPTER XXII.

The Possilence which came upon them.

AFTER these events a pestilential disease
followed the war, and at the approach of
the feast he wrote again to the brethren, de
scribing the sufferings consequent upon this
calamity.'

"To other men" the present might not
seem to be a suitable time for a festival.
Nor indeed is this or any other time suitable for
them ; neither sorrowful times, nor even such as
Now,
might be thought especially cheerful."
indeed, everything is tears and every one is
mourning, and wailings resound daily through
the city because of the multitude of the
dead and dying.
For as it was written of
the firstborn of the Egyptians, so now ‘there
has arisen a great cry, for there is not a house
where there is not one dead.'" And would
that this were all !" For many terrible things
have happened already.
First, they drove
us out; and when alone, and persecuted, and
put to death by all, even then we kept the feast.
And every place of affliction was to us a place
of festival: field, desert, ship, inn, prison; but
the perfected martyrs kept the most joyous
festival of all, feasting in heaven. After these
things war and famine followed, which we
endured in common with the heathen.
But we
bore alone those things with which they afflicted
us, and at the same time we experienced also
the effects of what they inflicted upon and suf
fered from one another; and again, we rejoiced
in the peace of Christ, which he gave to us
alone.

"But after both we and they had enjoyed
a very brief season of rest this pestilence
assailed us; to them more dreadful than any
dread, and more intolerable than any other
calamity; and, as one of their own writers has
said, the only thing which prevails over all hope.

* This letter seems to have been written shortly before Easter of
the year 263; for the festal epistle to Hierax, quoted in the last
chapter, was written while the war was still in progress (i.e. in 262),
this one after its close.
It does not seem to have been a regular
festal epistle so-called, for in § 11, below, we are told that Dionysius
wrote a regular festal letter (toptagruxny ypad ov) to the brethren
in Egypt, and that apparently in connection with this same Easter
of the year 263.

but the heathen it assailed more severely."
Farther on he adds:

"The most of our brethren were unspar
ing in their exceeding love and brotherly kind
ness. They held fast to each other and visited
the sick fearlessly, and ministered to them con
tinually, serving them in Christ. And they died
with them most joyfully, taking the affliction of
others, and drawing the sickness from their
neighbors to themselves and willingly receiving
their pains. And many who cared for the sick
and gave strength to others died themselves,
having transferred to themselves their death.
And the popular saying which always seems a
mere expression of courtesy, they then made
real in action, taking their departure as the

others' ‘offscouring."

"Truly the best of our brethren departed
from life in this manner, including some
presbyters and deacons and those of the people
who had the highest reputation; so that this
form of death, through the great piety and
strong faith it exhibited, seemed to lack
nothing of martyrdom. And they took the
bodies of the saints in their open hands
and in their bosoms, and closed their eyes and
their mouths; and they bore them away on
their shoulders and laid them out; and they
clung to them and embraced them; and they
prepared them suitably with washings and gar
ments. And after a little they received like
treatment themselves, for the survivors were
continually following those who had gone before

them.

"But with the heatheneverything was quite
otherwise. They deserted those who began
to be sick, and fled from their dearest friends.
And they cast them out into the streets when
they were half dead, and left the dead like refuse,
unburied. They shunned any participation or
all
fellowship
their precautions, it was not easy for them to

with death; which yet, with

escape."

After this epistle, when peace had been
restored to the city, he wrote another fes
tal letter' to the brethren in Egypt, and again
several others besides this. And there is also

* Repop mua; cf. 1 Cor. iv. 13.

Walesius suggests that this may
have been a humble and complimentary form of salutation among
the Alexandrians: éyò eini neptumud orov (cf. our words, "Your
humble servant"); or, as he thinks more probable, that the ex
É. had come to be habitually applied to the Christians by the
eathen. The former interpretation seems to me the only possible
one in view of the words immediately preceding: "which always
seems a mere expression of courtesy." Certainly these words rule
out the second interpretation suggested by Valesius.

* The connection into which this festal epistle is brought with
the letter just quoted would seem to indicate that it was written not
a whole year, but very soon after that one. We may, therefore,
look upon it as Dionysius' festal epistle of the year 263 (see above,
note 1).
Neither this nor the "several others" spoken of just
below is now extant,

another On Exercise.
Moreover, he wrote
again an epistle to Hermanmon" and the
brethren in Egypt, describing at length
the
wickedness of Decius and his successors, and
mentioning the peace under Gallienus.

CHAPTER XXIII.

The A'eign of Gallienus.

universally acknowledged at once an old em
peror and a new, being before them and
continuing after them.
For according to
the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah,
‘Behold the things from the beginning have
come to pass, and new things shall now arise."
For as a cloud passing over the sun's rays and
obscuring them for a little time hides it and
appears in its place; but when the cloud has
passed by or is dissipated, the sun which had
risen before appears again; so Macrianus who
put himself forward and approached the existing
empire of Gallienus, is not, since he never
was.
But the other is just as he was. And
his kingdom, as if it had cast aside old age,
and had been purified from the former wicked
ness, now blossoms out more vigorously, and is
seen and heard farther, and extends in all direc
tions." "

-

He then indicates the time at which he

wrote this in the following words:

"It occurs to me again to review the days of
the imperial years.

most impious men, though they have been fa
mous, yet in a short time have become nameless.

* The peculiar form of reckoning employed here (the mention of
the seventh and then the ninth year) has caused considerable perplex
ity.
Stroth thinks that "Dionysius speaks here of the time when
Gallienus actually ruled in Egypt. For Macrianus had ruled there for
a year, and during that time the authority of Gallienus in that country
had been interrupted." The view of Pearson, however, seems to
me better. He remarks: "Whoever expressed himself thus, that
one after his seven years was passing his ninth year? This septem
nium (en raermpts) must designate something peculiar and different

power which he had held along with his father.
In the eighth year
of that empire [the father, Valerian, being in captivity in Persia],
Macrianus possessed himself of the imperial honor especially in
Egypt. After his assumption of the purple, however, Gallienus had
still much authority in Egypt. At length in the ninth year of Gal
lienus, i.e. in 261, Macrianus, the father and the two sons being
slain, the sovereignty of Gallienus was recognized also among the
Egyptians." "The ninth year of Gallienus, moreover, began about
midsummer of this year; and the time at which this letter was
written by Dionysius, as Eusebius observes, may be gathered from
that, and falls consequently before the Paschal season of 262 A.D."

Upon chiliasm in the early Church, see above,
in this chapter.
Bk. III. chap. 39, note 19.
It is interesting to note, that although
chiliasm had long lost its hold wherever the philosophical theology
of the third century had made itself felt, it still continued to maintain
its sway in other parts of the Church, especially in outlying districts
in the East, which were largely isolated from the great centers of
thought, and in the greater part of the West. By such Christians it
was looked upon, in fact, as the very kernel of Christianity, - they
lived as most Christians of the second century had, in the constant
hope of a speedy return of Christ to reign in power upon the earth.
The gradual ... of this remnant of §§ Christian belief in
volved the same kind of consequences as the disappearance of the
belief in the continued possession by the Church of the spirit of
prophecy (see Bk. V. chap. 16, note 1), and marks another step in
the progress of the ö. from the peculiarly enthusiastic spirit of
the first and second, to the more formal spirit of the third and sol

He was evidently afraid, however, that the book of Nepos, which
was widely circulated, would still continue to do damage, and there
fore he undertook to refute it in a work of his own, entitled Oz, the

His work, like his disputation,
undoubtedly had considerable effect, but chiliasm still prevailed in
some of the outlying distriots of Egypt for a number of generations.

Hesele (Conciliengesch.

Arsinoë, in 254 or 255, and the composition of the work of Dionysius

date of the disputation with such exactness, and must be content to
leave it quite undetermined, though it is not improbable that it took

There can be
no doubt on this score, and Jerome's statement in his commentary
seems to be a direct error.

casion of these was Nepos, a bishop in Egypt,
who taught that the promises to the holy men
in the Divine Scriptures should be understood
in a more Jewish manner, and that there would
be a certain millennium of bodily luxury
upon this earth.
As he thought that he
could establish his private opinion by the
Revelation of John, he wrote a book on
subject, entitled Refutation of Allegorists."
Dionysius opposes this in his books on the

"When I was in the district of Arsinoë,

vailed for a long time, so that schisms and apos
tasies of entire churches have resulted, I called
together the presbyters and teachers of the
brethren in the villages, - such brethren as
wished being also present, - and I exhorted
them to make a public examination of this
question. Accordingly when they brought
me this book, as if it were a weapon and
fortress impregnable, sitting with them from
morning till evening for three successive days, I
endeavored to correct what was written in
it. And I rejoiced over the constancy,
sincerity, docility, and intelligence of the
brethren, as we considered in order and with
moderation the questions and the difficulties
and the points of agreement. And we abstained
from defending in every manner and conten

satisfied us, we were not ashamed to change our
opinions and agree with others; but on the con
trary, conscientiously and sincerely, and with
hearts laid open before God, we accepted what
ever was established by the proofs and
teachings of the Holy Scriptures.
And
finally the author and mover of this teach
ing, who was called Coracion," in the hearing of
all the brethren that were present, acknowledged
and testified to us that he would no longer hold
this opinion, nor discuss it, nor mention nor
teach it, as he was fully convinced by the argu
ments against it. And some of the other brethren
expressed their gratification at the conference,
and at the spirit of conciliation and harmony
which all had manifested."

founded the sect which was called after him the
Cerinthian, desiring reputable authority for
his fiction, prefixed the name. For the doctrine which he taught was this: that the
kingdom of Christ will be an earthly one. And
as he was himself devoted to the pleasures of
the body and altogether sensual in his nature,
he dreamed that that kingdom would consist in
those things which he desired, namely, in the
delights of the belly and of sexual passion; that
is to say, in eating and drinking and marrying,
and in festivals and sacrifices and the slay
ing of victims, under the guise of which he
thought he could indulge his appetites with a

rather wonder because I do not understand it."
After this he examines the entire Book

impossible to understand it according to the
literal sense, proceeds as follows:

of Jesus Christ, which he gave him to show unto
his servants quickly; and he sent and signified
it by his angel unto his servant John, who bare
witness of the word of God and of his testi
mony, even of all things that he saw.''
Then he writes also an epistle: ‘John to
the seven churches which are in Asia, grace
be with you, and peace."
But the evangelist
did not prefix his name even to the Catholic
Epistle; but without introduction he begins with
divine revelation itself:
the mystery of the
‘That which was from the beginning, which we
have heard, which we have seen with our
eyes."
For because of such a revelation the
Lord also blessed Peter, saying, "Blessed art
thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood hath
not revealed it unto thee, but my heavenly
Father.'"
But neither in the reputed sec
ond or third epistle of John, though they
are very short, does the name John appear; but

sufficient to give his name once and to proceed
with his work; but he takes it up again : "I,
John, who also am your brother and companion
in tribulation, and in the kingdom and in the
patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is
called Patmos for the Word of God and the tes
timony of Jesus.'" And toward the close he
speaks thus: ‘Blessed is he that keepeth the
words of the prophecy of this book, and I, John,

ll

who saw and heard these things.'"

"But that he who wrote these things was
called John must be believed, as he says it;
but who he was does not appear.
For he did
not say, as often in the Gospel, that he was the
beloved disciple of the Lord," or the one who
lay on his breast," or the brother of James, or
the eyewitness and hearer of the Lord.
For he would have spoken of these things

if he had wished to show himself plainly.
But
he says none of them ; but speaks of him
self as our brother and companion, and a wit
ness of Jesus, and blessed because he had
seen and heard the revelations.
But I am
of the opinion that there were many with
the same name as the apostle John, who, on
account of their love for him, and because they
admired and emulated him, and desired to be
loved by the Lord as he was, took to themselves
the same surname, as many of the children
of the faithful are called Paul or Peter. For
example, there is also another John, sur
named Mark, mentioned in the Acts of the
Apostles," whom Barnabas and Paul took with
them ; of whom also it is said, "And they had

not written that he went with them into Asia,
but, ‘Now when Paul and his company set sail
from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia;
and John departing from them returned to
Jerusalem."
But I think that he was some
other one of those in Asia; as they say that
there are two monuments in Ephesus, each bear
ing the name of John."

"And from the ideas, and from the words
and their arrangement, it may be reasonably
conjectured that this one is different from
that one."
For the Gospel and Epistle
agree with each other and begin in the same
manner. The one says, "In the beginning was
the Word';* the other, "That which was from
the beginning." The one: "And the Word was
made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of
the Father';* the other says the same things
slightly altered : "Which we have heard, which
we have seen with our eyes; which we have
looked upon and our hands have handled of
the Word of life, - and the life was mani
fested."
For he introduces these things
at the beginning, maintaining them, as is
evident from what follows, in opposition to those
who said that the Lord had not come in the
flesh.
Wherefore also he carefully adds, "And
we have seen and bear witness, and declare unto
you the eternal life which was with the Father

one and the same character marks the
Gospel and the Epistle throughout.
But
the Apocalypse is different from these writ
ings and foreign to them ; not touching, nor in
the least bordering upon them ; almost, so to
speak, without even a syllable in common
with them. Nay more, the Epistle - for I
pass by the Gospel - does not mention nor
does it contain any intimation of the Apocalypse,
nor does the Apocalypse of the Epistle.
But
Paul, in his epistles, gives some indication of his
revelations," though he has not written them out

by themselves.

"Moreover, it can also be shown that the
diction of the Gospel and Epistle differs
from that of the Apocalypse.
For they
were written not only without error as re
gards the Greek language, but also with ele
gance in their expression, in their reasonings,
and in their entire structure. They are far in
deed from betraying any barbarism or Solecism,
or any vulgarism whatever.
For the writer had,
as it seems, both the requisites of discourse, -
that is, the gift of knowledge and the gift of
expression, - as the Lord had bestowed
them both upon him.
I do not deny that
the other writer saw a revelation and re
ceived knowledge and prophecy.
I perceive,
however, that his dialect and language are not
accurate Greek, but that he uses barbarous
idioms, and, in some places, Solecisms.
It
is unnecessary to point these out here, for I
would not have any one think that I have said
these things in a spirit of ridicule, for I have
said what I have only with the purpose of show
ing clearly the difference between the writings."

of Bernice, and one to Telesphorus," and one to
Euphranor, and again another to Ammon and
Euporus. He wrote also four other books on
the same subject, which he addressed to
his namesake Dionysius, in Rome." Besides
these many of his epistles are with us,
and large books written in epistolary form, as
those on Nature," addressed to the young man
Timothy, and one on Temptations," which
he also dedicated to Euphranor. More
over, in a letter to Basilides, bishop of the
Pentapolis, he says that he had
parishes in
written an exposition of the beginning of Eccle
siastes." And he has left us also various letters

* The works addressed to Ammon, Telesphorus, Euphranor, and
Euporus, are no longer extant, nor do we know anything about
them (but see chap. 6, note 2, above).
It is possible that it was in
these epistles that, Dionysius laid himself open in his zeal against
the Sabellians to the charge of tritheism, which aroused complaints
against him, and j in his being obliged to defend himself in
his work addressed to Dionysius of Rome. If so, these letters must
have been written before that work, though perhaps not long before.

The date and immediate occasion of this
work cannot be determined. The supposition of Dittrich, that it
was written before Dionysius became bishop, while he had more
leisure than afterward for philosophical study, has much in its favor.
The young man, Timothy, to whom it was addressed, is perhaps to
be identified with the one mentioned in Bk. VI. chap. 40, § 4. That
it was a work of considerable extent, embracing more than one book,
is indicated by Eusebius in this passage. A long extract from it is
given by Eusebius in his Praep. Ezang. XIV. 23-27 (printed with
commentary by Routh, Rey. Sac. IV. p. 393 sq.; translated in the
Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. VI. p. § 3. and a few fragments
are still preserved in a Vatican codex, and have been published by
Simon de Magistris, in his edition of Dionysius' works (Rome,

1796), p. 44 sq. (cf. also Routh, IV. p. 418, 419).
quoted by £io, Dionysius deals solely with the atomic theory
of Democritus and Epicurus.
This subject may have occupied the
greater part of the work, but evidently, as Dittrich remarks (Diony
sius der Grosse, p. 12), the doctrines of other physicists were also
dealt with (cf. the words with which Eusebius introduces his ex
tracts; Prara. Evang. XIV. 22. Io: "I will subjoin from the books
[of Dionysius] On Nature a few of the things urged against Epi
curus." The translation in the Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. VI.
§ 84, note 7, which implies that the work was written "against the
Čpicureans" is not correct); bugs seems to have been taken by
Dionysius in the sense of the "Universe" (compare, sor instance,
the words of Cicero, De mat. deorum, II., to which Dittrich refers:
Sunt attem, one i mattrae nomine rerum universitatem intelli
gunt), and to %. been devoted to a refutation of the doctrines of
various heathen philosophers in regard to the origin of the universe.

was metropolitan of that district (cf. Routh, Rel. Sac. 11s., p. 235).

the latter's death, and were afterward reprinted in De Magistris'

still a presbyter, one of his cpistles on baptism (see above, chap. 7,
§ 6, where 3. latter is called by Eusebius a "learned and doi:
man"). Another epistle of the same writer addressed to him is
mentioned in chap. 9, § 6. , Dionysius of Alexandria's four books
against the Sabellians were likewise addressed to him (see chap. 26,

Paul reproduced the heresy of Artemon (see above,
truthfulness.
Bk. V. chap. 28), to: that Christ was a mere man, though he
was filled with divine power, and that from his birth, not merely
from his baptism, as the Ebionites had held. He admitted, too, the
foo". § the Holy Spirit. "He denied the personality of the
ogos, and of the Holy Spirit, and considered them merely powers
of God, like reason and mind in man; but granted that the Logos
dwelt in Christ in a larger measure than in any former messenger
of God, and taught, like the Socinians in later times, a gradual ele
vation of Christ, determined by his own moral development, to
divine dignity. . He admitted that Christ remained free from sin,
conquered the sin of our forefathers, and then became the Saviour
of the race" (Schaff).
At various Antiochian synods (the exact
number of them we do not know), efforts were made to procurc his
condemnation, but they were not successful.
Finally one of the
synods condemned and excommunicated him, and Domnus was
appointed bishop in his place. The date of this synod is ordinarily
fixed at 268 or 269, but it cannot have occurred in 269, and probably
occurred earlier than 268 (see below, chap. 29, note 1).

a copy of it was originally appended to the encyclical of the Anti

these were the most illustrious. When all

him. He was a man learned in other respects,
and principal of the sophist school of Grecian
learning in Antioch ; yet on account of the su
perior nobility of his faith in Christ he had been
made a presbyter of that parish.
This man,
having conducted a discussion with him, which
was taken down by stenographers and which we
know is still extant, was alone able to detect the
man who dissembled and deceived the others.

Meanwhile, Dionysius died in the twelfth
year of the reign of Gallienus," having held
the episcopate of Alexandria for seventeen
years, and Maximus" succeeded him. Gal
lienus after a reign of fifteen years" was
succeeded by Claudius," who in two years deliv

CHAPTER XXIX.

Paul, having been refused by J/a/chion, a Pres
Ayser from the Sophists, was excommunicated.

DURING his reign a final synod' composed
of a great many bishops was held, and the
leader of heresy" in Antioch was detected, and
his false doctrine clearly shown before all, and
he was excommunicated from the Catholic
Church under heaven." Malchion especially
drew him out of his hiding-place and refuted

• In both versions of the Chron. the death of Dionysius is put
in the eleventh year of Gallienus, i.e. August, 263, to August, 264,
and this, or the date given here by Eusebius (the twelfth year,
August, 264, to August, 265) is undoubtedly correct. Upon the
dates of his accession and death, see Bk. VI. chap. 4o, note 1.
10 Maximus had been a presbyter while Dionysius was bishop of
Alexandria, and had o him the hardships of the Decian
and Valerian persecutions (see above, chap. 11).
In chap. 32, he
is said to have held office eighteen years, and with this both ver
sions of the Chron. agree, and there is no reason to doubt the accu
racy of the report.

11 Eusebius here, as in his Chron., reckons the reign of Gallie
nus as beginning with the date of his association with his father in
the supreme power; i.e. August, 253.

12 Claudius became emperor in March, 268, and died of an epi
demic in Sirmium some time in the year 270, when he was succeeded
by Aurelian, whom he had himself appointed his successor just be
fore his death.
It is, perhaps, with this in mind that Eusebius uses
the somewhat peculiar phrase, ueraðiðwo rmv myellowtav.

Eusebius puts this council in the reign of Aurelian (270-275),
and in chap. 32 makes it subsequent to the siege of the Brucheium,
which, according to his Chron., took place in 272. The epistle
written at this council (and given in the next chapter) is addressed
to Maximus, bishop of Alexandria, and Dionysius, bishop of Rome,
so that the latter must have been alive in 272, if the council was

to the year 269, and Dionysius' death to December of the same year;
but Lipsius has shown (ibid. p. 226 ft.) that the synod which }.
bius mentions here was held in all probability as early as 265 (but
not earlier than 264, because Dionysius of Alexandria was not suc
ceeded by Maximus until that year), certainly not later than 268,
and hence it is not necessary to extend the episcopate of Dionysius
of Rome beyond 268, the date which he has shown to be most prob
able (see chap. 27, note 2). Eusebius then is entirely mistaken in
putting the council into the reign of Aurelian.

that an account of him is given by Jerome in his de vir. ill. 71. He
tells us, however, nothing new about him, except that he was the
author of an epistle to !"i". of Alexandria and Rome, referring
probably to the encyclical letter given in the next chapter. We do
not know upon what authority he bases this statement: in fact,
knowing the character of his work, we shall probably be safe in
assuming that the statement is no more than a guess on his part.
There is nothing improbable in the report, but we must remember
that Jerome is our only authority for it, and he is in such a case

The Epistle of the Bishops against Paul.

THE pastors who had assembled about
this matter, prepared by common consent
an epistle addressed to Dionysius,' bishop of
Rome, and Maximus" of Alexandria, and sent
it to all the provinces.

of Paul, and the arguments and discussions which
they had with him, and show the entire life and

record at the present time the following extracts
from their writing:

"To Dionysius and Maximus, and to all
our fellow-ministers throughout the world,
bishops, presbyters, and deacons, and to the
whole Catholic Church under heaven," Helenus,"
Hymenaeus, Theophilus, Theotecnus, Maximus,
Proclus, Nicomas, AElianus, Paul, Bolanus, Pro
togenes, Hierax, Eutychius, Theodorus," Mal
chion, and Lucius, and all the others who dwell
with us in the neighboring cities and nations,
bishops,
presbyters, and deacons, and the
churches of God, greeting to the beloved
brethren in the Lord." A little farther on
they proceed thus: "We sent for and called
many of the bishops from a distance to relieve
us from this deadly doctrine; as Dionysius of
Alexandria" and Firmilianus' of Cappadocia,

in the Dict, of Christ. Biog, the report is repeated as a fact). Both
Eusebius and Jerome tell us that the report of his discussion with
Paul was extant in their day, and a few fragments of it have been
preserved, and are given by Leontius (de Sectis, III. p. 504, accord
ing to Fremantle).

of Palmyra, an official so-called because his salary was 200 sestertia.
"The $o. was an imperial procurator, so-called from his
salary of 200 sesteria, or 16oo pounds a year. Some critics suppose
that the bishop of Antioch i...i. obtained such an office from

There seems to be no reason to doubt that
Paul held such a position under Zenobia, which appears to be the

a high official, even as "Viceroy" of Zenobia. We know from
Athanasius (A/ist. A 2-. § 71, Oxf. ed. Chap. VIII. § 10), that he
was a great savorite with Zenobia, and that to her he owed the privi
lege of retaining his bishopric after the synod had deposed him.

strictest manners, is much in his favor, and almost tempts us to

But the Greek is 8mu a we v ×ai 6póvov von Aov, and
Rufinus is certainly wrong in putting his multo altius with the

such, not upon the height of it, while the topovos is condemned
because of its height. The translation of Rufinus shows what was
the custom in his day. He could not understand that a Bowa should
be objected to as such.

it means of course a sort of cabinet which Paul had at the side of
the tribunal, in which he could hold private conferences, and whose

Son of God has come down from heaven. And
this is not a mere assertion, but it is abundantly

(o avober opxówevos on divo mavrov to riv). The words quoted in
the epistle can hardly have been used by Paul himself. They are
rather to be regarded as a logical inference from his positions stated
by the writers of the epistle in order to bring out the blasphemous
nature of his views when contrasted with the statement in John,
which was doubtless in their minds while they wrote.

1* The account seems to me without doubt overdrawn at this
point.
It was such a common thing, from the time of Herod
Agrippa down, to accuse a man who was noted for his arrogance of
encouraging the people to call him an angel descended from heaven,
that we should almost be surprised if the accusation were omitted
here. We have no reason to think, in spite of the report of these
good Fathers, that Paul's presumption went to such a blasphemous
and at the same time absurd o

* It is quite probable that Paul had given some ground for the
suspicions which the worthy bishops breathe here, but that is very
far from saying that he was actually guilty of immorality.
In fact,
just below (§ 13), they show that these are nothing more than sus
picions.
Exactly what position the two women held who are men
tioned in § 14 it is difficult to say, but Paul must of course have
given some plausible reason for their presence, and this is implied
in § 16, where the writers say that were he orthodox, they would in
quire his reasons for this conduct, but since he is a heretic, it is not
worth while to investigate the matter. As remarked above, while
the direct statements of the epistle can in the inain hardly be
doubted, we must nevertheless remember that the prejudices of the
writers would lead them to paint the life of Paul as black as circum
stances could possibly warrant, and unfounded suspicions might
therefore easily be taken as equivalent to proved charges.

goes, and at the same time lives in luxury
and surfeiting?
Because of these things all
mourn and lament by themselves; but they
so fear his tyranny and power, that they
dare not accuse him.
But as we have said,
while one might call the man to account
for this conduct, if he held the Catholic doc
trine and was numbered with us," since he has
scorned the mystery and struts about in the
abominable heresy of Artemas" (for why should
we not mention his father?), we think it un
necessary to demand of him an explanation of
these things."

Afterwards, at the close of the epistle,

they add these words:

"Therefore we have been compelled to ex
communicate him, since he sets himself against
God, and refuses to obey; and to appoint in
his place another bishop for the Catholic Church.
By divine direction, as we believe, we have ap
pointed Domnus," who is adorned with all the
qualities becoming in a bishop, and who is a
son of the blessed Demetrianus," who formerly
presided in a distinguished manner over the
same parish. We have informed you of this that
you may write to him, and may receive letters of

to Artemas; and let those who think as Artemas
does, communicate with him.""

* We get a glimpse here of the relative importance of orthodoxy
and morality in the minds of these Fathers. Had Paul been ortho
dox, they would have asked him to explain his course, and would
have endeavored to persuade him to reform his conduct; but since

not condemned because he is immoral, but because he is heretical.
The implication is that he might have been even worse than he was
in his morals and yet no decisive steps have been taken against him,
had he not deviated from the orthodox faith. The Fathers, in fact,
by their letters, put themselves in a sad dilemma.
Either Paul was
not as wicked as they try to make him out, or else they were shame
fully indifferent to the moral character of their bishops, and even of
the incumbents of their most prominent sees.

* On Artemas, or Artemon, see Bk. V. chap. 28, note 1.

Paul's
heresy was a reproduction of his, as remarked above, chap. 27, note 4.
* The action of this council in appointing Domnus was entirely
irregular, as the choice of the bishop devolved upon the clergy and the
people of the diocese. . But the synod was afraid that Paul's influence
would be great enough to secure his re-election, and hence they took
this summary means of disposing of him. ... But it was only after the
accession of Aurelian that Paul was actually removed from his bish
opric and Domnus was enabled to enter upon his office (see chap.
27, note 4). The exact date of Domnus' appointment is uncertain,
as already shown (see the note just reserred to); so also the date of
his death.
Both versions of the Chron. put his accession in the
year of Abr. 2283 (A.D. 265), and Jerome's version puts the acces
sion of his successor, Timaeus, in the year of Abr; 2.288 (A. D. 270),
while the Armenian omits the notice entirely We can place no
reliance whatever upon these dates; the date of Domnus' death
is certainly at least two years too early (see the note already re
ferred to).

they might be admitted to communion by foreign bishops; while the

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[VII. 30.

As Paul had fallen from the episcopate,
as well as from the orthodox faith, Domnus,
as has been said, became bishop of the
church at Antioch.
But as Paul refused to
surrender the church building, the Emperor
Aurelian was petitioned ; and he decided the
matter most equitably, ordering the building to
be given to those to whom the bishops of Italy
and of the city of Rome should adjudge it."
Thus this man was driven out of the church,
with extreme disgrace, by the worldly power.
Such was Aurelian's treatment of us at that
time; but in the course of his reign he
changed his mind in regard to us, and was moved
by certain advisers to institute a persecution
‘against us." And there was great talk about
this on every side.
But as he was about to
do it, and was, so to speak, in the very act
of signing the decrees against us, the divine judg
ment came upon him and restrained him at the
very verge" of his undertaking, showing in a
manner that all could see clearly, that the rulers
of this world can never find an opportunity
against the churches of Christ, except the hand
that defends them permits it, in divine and heav
enly judgment, for the sake of discipline and
correction, at such times as it sees best.

After a reign of six years," Aurelian was
succeeded by Probus. He reigned for the
same number of years, and Carus, with his sons,
Carinus and Numerianus, succeeded him.
After
they had reigned less than three years the gov
ernment devolved on Diocletian, and those as
sociated with him." Under them took place

probable) that he was still alive at this time, in which case his
activity in Rome, must be put somewhat later than the commonly
accepted dates, viz. the episcopate of Zephyrinus (202-217).
* See chap. 27, note 4. #. bishop of Rome to whose judgment

Aurelian appealed was Felix, mentioned below.

* Aurelian, according to tradition, was the author of the ninth
Eusebius oly is the ultimate source to which
of the "ten great persecutions" against the Church.
But the report
is a mistake.
the report is to be referred, but he says expressly that he died before
he was able to begin his intended persecution, and more than that,
that he was even prevented from signing the decree, so that it is not
proper to speak even of an hostile edict of Aurelian (as many do
who reject the actual persecution). It is true that in Lactantius'
Pe mort. Aersecutors, sus, chap. 6, it is said that Aurelian actually
issued edicts against the Christians, but that he died before they had
found their way to the most distant provinces.
It seems probable,
however, that ło, account is nearest the truth, and that the
reports that Aurelian actually signed the edicts as well as that he
commenced the persecution are both developments from the original
and more correct version of the affair which Eusebius gives.
There
is no reason to doubt the account of Eusebius.
Aurelian's conduct
in the case of Paul does not imply any special friendliness on his
part toward the Church. The Christians had secured legal recog
nition under Gallienus; and it was a simple act of common justicc
to put the valuable property of the Church in Antioch into the hands
of the rightful owners whoever they might be.
His act does imply,
however, that he cannot have been in the beginning actively hostile
to the Church, for in that case he would simply have driven Paul
out, and confiscated the property.

* Aurelian reigned from 279 to 275, and was succeeded by
Tacitus, who ruled only six months, and he in turn by Probus (276 to
282), who was followed by Carus and his sons Carinus and Numerian,
and they in turn by Diocletian in 284.
Eusebius here omits Tacitus,
although he mentions him in his Chron., and assigns six months to
his reign, and five years and six months to the reign of Aurelian.

* Diocletian associated Maximian with himself in the govern
ment in 286, and sent him to command the West with the title of
Augustus.
In 293 he appointed Constantius Chlorus and Galerius
as Caesars, giving to the former the government of Gaul and Britain,

the persecution of our time, and the destruc
tion of the churches connected with it.
Shortly before this, Dionysius," bishop of 23
Rome, after holding office for nine years,
died, and was succeeded by Felix."

CHAPTER XXXI.

The Perversize //eresy of the J/anicheams which

At this time, the madman," named from
his demoniacal heresy, armed himself in
the perversion of his reason, as the devil, Satan,

to the latter that of the provinces between thc Adriatic and the
Euxine, while Maximian held Africa and Italy, and Diocletian him
self retained the provinces of Asia. He issued an edict, opening his
famous persecution against the Christians, of which Eusebius gives
an account in the next book, on Feb. 23, 303.

* On Dionysius, bishop of Rome, see chap. 27, note 2.
* According to the Liberian catalogue, Felix became bishop on
the fifth of January, 269, and held office five years eleven months and
twenty-five days, until the thirtieth of December, 274, and these dates
Lipsius accepts as correct.
Eusebius, in chap. 32, gives five years
as the duration of his episcopate, and with this Jerome's version of
the Chron. agrees, while the Armenian gives ninetcen years, which
is absolutely inconsistent with its own notices, and must be of course
a copyist's mistake. Jerome puts the accession of Felix in the first
year of Probus, which is wide of the mark, and the Armenian in the
first year of Aurelian, which is not so far out of the way.

Felix addressed a letter, in regard to Paul of Samosata, to Maxi
mus and the clergy of Antioch, of which fragments have been pre
served in the Apology of Cyril of Alexandria, and in the Acts of the
Council of Ephesus (given by Mansi, Conc. I. 1114).
The report
of his martyrdom is probably a mistake, and has resulted from con
fusing him with Felix II., who was bishop of Rome in the fourth
century.

* The name Manes, or Mani, is not of Greek, but of Persian or
Semitic origin.
It has not yet been satisfactorily explained. The
Greek form is Marms or Mavoxatos; the Latin form, Manes or
J/a michaeus.
In this place Eusebius instead of giving him his true
name makes a play upon it, calling him o udovets tas operas, "the
madman." This does not imply ū. Eusebius supposed his name
was originally Greek. He perhaps - as others of . Fathers didregarded it as a sign of divine providence that the Persian name
chosen by himself (Mani was not his original name) should when
reproduced in Greek bear such a significant meaning.
See Stroth's
note on this passage.

Eusebius' brief account is the first authentic description we have
of Manes and Manichaeism.
It is difficult to get at the exact truth
in regard to the life of Manes himself. We have it reported in two
conflicting forms, an Oriental and an Occidental. The former, how
ever, - though our sources for it are much later than for the latteris undoubtedly the more reliable of the two. The differences be
tween the two accounts cannot be discussed here. We know that
Mani was a well-educated Persian philosopher of the third century
(according to Kessler, 205-276 A.D.; according to the Oriental source
used by i. about 240-276), who attempted to supersede
Zoroastrianism, the old religion of Persia, by a syncretistic system
made up of elements taken from Parsism, Buddhism, and Christian
ity. He was at first well received by the Persian king, Sapor I.,
but aroused the hatred of the Magian priests, and was compelled to
flee from the country.
Returning after some time, he gained a
large following, but was put to death by King Varanes I. about
276 A.D.
His sect spread rapidly throughout Christendom, and in
spite of repeated persecutions flourished for many centuries. The
mysteriousness of its doctrine, its compact organization, its apparent
solution of the terrible problem of evil, and its show of ascetic holi
ness combined to make it very attractive to thoughtful minds, as,
e.g. to Augustine. The sundamental principle of the system is a
radical dualism between good and evil, light and darkness. This
dualism runs through its morals as well as through its theology,
and the result is a rigid asceticism.
Christianity furnished some
ideas, but its influence is chiefly seen in the organization of the
sect, which had apostles, bishops, presbyters, deacons, and traveling
missionaries.
Manichaeism cannot be called a heresy, - it was
rather an independent religion as Mohammedanism was. The sys
tem cannot be further discussed here. The chief works upon the
subject are Beausobre's //ist. Crit. de Manti-hae et d'i, Man sche

in life, both in word and deed ; and in his
nature demoniacal and insane.

of this he sought to pose as Christ, and being
puffed up in his madness, he proclaimed himself
the Paraclete and the very Holy Spirit; * and
afterwards, like Christ, he chose twelve dis

he patched together false and godless doc

* Beausobre maintains that Mani did not pretend to be the
Paraclete, but merely a man, the messenger of the Paraclete. The
Fathers generally, however, agree with Eusebius in asserting that
his claims were of the very highest sort. The point cannot be satis
factorily settled.

* See 1 Tim. vi. 20.
* On Felix, see chap. 30, note 34.
* Jerome's version of the Chron. agrees with this passage in
assigning eight months to the episcopate of Eutychianus, while the
Armenian gives him only two months. The Liberian catalogue, how
ever, gives eight years eleven months and three days; and 'o';
accepts these figures as correct, putting his accession on the fifth of
January, 275, and his death on the eighth of December, 283. Jerome
puts his accession in the fifth year of Probus, which is wide of the
mark, the Armenian in the second year, which is also too late by
about two years.
Lipsius explains the eight months of the Church
Asistory and the Chron. as a change, in their original source, of
years to months. The present error makes up in part for the error
in chap. 27, where Xystus is given eleven years instead of cleven
months. £io was not a martyr, but was buried, according
to the Liberian catalogue, in the Catacombs of St. Calixtus, a state
ment which has been confirmed by the discovery of a stone bearing
his name.

* According to the Liberian catalogue, Caius became bishop on
the 17th of December, 283, and held office for twelve years four
jū. and six (or seven) days, i.e. until April 22, 296, and these
dates are accepted by Lipsius as correct.
Both versions of the
Chron. agree with the History in assigning fifteen years to Caius'
episcopate, but this error is of a piece with the others which abound
in this period. The report of his martyrdom is fabulous.

* According to the Liberian catalogue, Marcellinus became
bishop on the 3oth of June, 296, and held office for eight years three
... and twenty-five days, i.e. until the 25th of October, 304,
and these dates Lipsius accepts as correct, although there is con
siderable uncertainty as to the exact date of his death. Jerome's
Yersion of the Chron. puts his accession in the twelfth year of
Diocletian, which is not far out of the way, but does not give the
duration of his episcopate, nor does Eusebius in his History. The
Armenian Chron. does not mention Marcellinus at all.
Tradition,
although denied by many of the Fathers, says that he proved wanting
in the Diocletian persecution, and this seems to have been a fact.
It is also said that he afterward repented and suffered martyrdom,
but that is only an invention. The expression of Eusebius in this
connection is ambiguous; he simply says he was "overtaken by the
persecution," which might mean martyrdom, or might mean simply
arrest. The eleven bishops that preceded him from Pontianus to

overtaken by the persecution.
About the
same time Timaeus" received the episcopate
of Antioch after Domnus,' and Cyril," who lived
in our day, succeeded him.
In his time we
became acquainted with Dorotheus," a man of
learning among those of his day, who was hon
ored with the office of presbyter in Antioch.
He was a lover of the beautiful in divine things,
and devoted himself to the Hebrew language,
so that he read the Hebrew Scriptures
with facility." He belonged to those who
were especially liberal, and was not unac
quainted with Grecian propaedeutics."
Besides
this he was a eunuch," having been so from
his very birth. On this account, as if it were a
miracle, the emperor" took him into his family,
and honored him by placing him over the
purple dye-works at Tyre. We have heard
him expound

" Of Timaeus we know nothing, nor can we fix his dates. The
Chron. puts his accession in the year of Abr. 2288 (270 A.D.), and
the accession of his successor, Cyril, in 2297 (279 A.D.), but the
former at least is certainly far too early. ños. Zeit des Jena
to us, p. 53) concludes that Cyril must have been bishop as early as
280, and hence neither Domnus nor Timaeus can have held office a
great while.

7 On Domnus, see chap. 30, note 24.
* According to Jerome's Chrozo., Cyril became bishop in the
ear of Abr. 2297, or fourth year of Probus (279-280 A.D.); and
Harnack accepts this as at least approximately correct. The same
authority, puts the accession of his successor, Tyrannus, in the
eighteenth year of Diocletian (301-302 A.D.), and just below Euse
bius says that the destruction of the churches § IXiocletian's perse
cution) took place under Tyrannus, not under Cyril. But the Pass to
sanctorum quattuor coronatorum (see Mason's Persecution of
Procletian, p. 259-271) contains a reference to him which assumes
that he was condemned to the mines, and died there after three
years. The condemnation, if a fact, must have taken place after
the second edict of Diocletian (303 A.D.), and his death therefore in
306. There is no other authority for this report, but Harnack con
siders it in the highest degree probable, and the indirect way in
which Cyril is mentioned certainly argues for its truth.
Neither
Eusebius nor Jerome, however, seems to have known anything
about it, and this is very hard to explain. The matter must, in fact,
be left undecided.

See Harnack, Zeit des /gnatius, p. 53 sq.

* This Dorotheus and his contemporary, Lucian (mentioned
below, in Bk. VIII. chap. 13), are the earliest representatives of the
sound critical method of Biblical exegesis, for .. the theological
school at Antioch was distinguished, over against the school of
Alexandria, in which the allegorical method was practiced. From
Bk. VIII. chap. 6 we learn that Dorotheus suffered martyrdom by
hanging early in the Diocletian persecution, so that it must have
been from this emperor, and not }. Constantine, that he received
his appointment mentioned just below.
I liocletian, before he began
to persecute, had a number of Christian officials in his household,
and treated them with considerable favor.

* As Closs remarks, the knowledge of Hebrew was by no means
a common thing among the early teachers of the Church; and there
fore Dorotheus is praised for his acquaintance with it.

But this prohibition was not to
apply to persons who were made eunuchs by physicians or by their

expressly to those who have purposely performed the act upon them
selves, and hence nothing would have stood in the way of the ad
vancement of one born a eunuch as Dorotheus was, even had he
lived after the Council of Nicaea, and still less previous to that time.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[VII. 32.

ceived the episcopate of the parish of Antioch.
In his time occurred the destruction of the

churches.

Eusebius," who had come from the city
of Alexandria, ruled the parishes of Laodi
cea after Socrates." The occasion of his re
moval thither was the affair of Paul. He went
on this account to Syria, and was restrained
from returning home by those there who were
zealous in divine things. Among our contem
poraries he was a beautiful example of religion,
as is readily seen from the words of Diony
sius which we have quoted."
Anatolius"
was appointed his successor; one good
man, as they say, following another. He also
was an Alexandrian by birth.
In learning and
skill in Greek philosophy, such as arithmetic and
geometry, astronomy, and dialectics in general,
as well as in the theory of physics, he stood first
among the ablest men of our time, and he was
also at the head in rhetorical science.
It is re
ported that for this reason he was requested by
the citizens of Alexandria to establish there a

school of Aristotelian philosophy."

They relate of him many other eminent
deeds during the siege of the Pyrucheium"

306.
According to Theodoret, H. E. I. 3, his successor, Vitalis, is
said to have become bishop "after peace had been restored to the
Church," which seems to imply, though it is not directly said, that
Tyrannus himself lived until that time (i.e. until 311). We know
nothing certainly either about his character or the dates of his
episcopate.
15 }. Eusebius, who is mentioned with praise by Dionysius
of Alexandria, in the epistle quoted in chap. 11, above, was a deacon
in the church of Alexandria, who distinguished himself by his good
offices during the persecution of Valerian (A.D. 257), as recorded in
that epistle, and also during the revolt and siege ; Alexandria after
the death of Valerian (in 262), as recorded in this chapter. From
the account given here we see that he attended the first, or at least
one of the earlier councils of Antioch in which the case of Paul was
discussed (undoubtedly as the representative of Dionysius, whose
age prevented his attending the first one, as mentioned in chap. 27),
and the Laodiceans, becoming acquainted with him there, compelled
him to accept the bishopric of their church, at that time vacant. As
we see from the account of Anatolius' appointment farther on in
this chapter, he died before the meeting of the council which con
demned Paul. We know in regard to him only what is told us in
these two chapters. The name Eusebius was a very common one
in the early Church. The Dict. of Christ. Biog. mentions 137
persons of à. name belonging to the first eight centuries.

10 Of this Socrates we know nothing.
* In chap. 11, above.
** Anatolius we are told here was a man of great distinction both
for his learning and for his practical common sense.
It is not said
that he held any ecclesiastical office in Alexandria, but farther on
in the chapter we are told that he left that city after the close of the
siege, as Eusebius had done, and that he was ordained assistant
bishop by Theotecnus, bishop of Caesarea, and was the latter's
colleague in that church for a short time. When on his way to
(possibly on his return from) the synod of Antioch, which passed
condemnation upon Paul (and at which Theotecnus was also pres
ent), he passed through Laodicea and wasFollo upon to accept
the bishopric of that city, Eusebius, his old friend, being deceased.
The way in which Laodicea got its two bishops is thus somewhat
remarkable. The character of Anatolius is clear from the account
which follows. Jerome mentions him in his de vir, ill. chap. 73,
and in his EA. ad Magnum (Migne, No. 70), but adds nothing to
pon his writings, one of which is quoted in
Eusebius' account.
this chapter, see below, notes 21 and 32.

* The Pyrucheium (the MSS. of Eusebius vary, considerably
in their spelling, but I have adopted that form which seems best
supported) or Brucheium (as it is called by other ancient writers
and as it is more generally known) was one of the three districts of
Alexandria and was inhabited by the royal family and by the Greeks.
It was the finest and most, beautiful quarter of the city, and con
tained, besides the royal palaces, many magnificent public buildings.
Comprising, as it did, the citadel as well, it was besieged a number

in Alexandria, on account of which he was es
pecially honored by all those in high office; but
I will give the following only as an example.
They say that bread had failed the besieged,
so that it was more difficult to withstand
the famine than the enemy outside; but he
being present provided for them in this manner.
As the other part of the city was allied with the
Roman army, and therefore was not under
siege, Anatolius sent for Eusebius, - for he was
still there before his transfer to Syria, and was
among those who were not besieged, and pos
sessed, moreover, a great reputation and a re
the
nowned name which had reached even
Roman general, - and he informed him of
those who were perishing in the siege from
famine. When he learned this he requested
the Roman commander as the greatest pos
sible favor, to grant safety to deserters from the

municated it to Anatolius.
As soon as he re
ceived the message he convened the senate of
Alexandria, and at first proposed that all should
come to a reconciliation with the Romans. But
when he perceived that they were angered by
this advice, he said, "But I do not think you
will oppose me, if I counsel you to send the
supernumeraries and those who are in nowise
useful to us, as old women and children and old
men, outside the gates, to go wherever they may
please.
For why should we retain for no pur
pose these who must at any rate soon die? and
why should we destroy with hunger those who
are crippled and maimed in body, when we
ought to provide only for men and youth, and to
distribute the necessary bread among those who
are needed for the garrison of the city ?"
With such arguments he persuaded the assembly, and rising first he gave his vote that
the entire multitude, whether of men or women,
who were not needful for the army, should de
part from the city, because if they remained and
unnecessarily continued in the city, there would be
for them no hope of safety, but they would
perish with famine. As all the others in the
Senate agreed to this, he saved almost all the
besieged. He provided that first, those belong
ing to the church, and afterwards, of the others
in the city, those of every age should escape,
not only the classes included in the decree, but,
under cover of these, a multitude of others,
secretly clothed in women's garments; and
through his management they went out of the
gates by night and escaped to the Roman camp.

of times, and it is uncertain which siege is meant in the present
case.
It seems to me most likely that we are to think of the time
of the revolt of Aemilian (see above, chap. 11, note 4), in 260 A.D.,
when the Romans under Theodotus besieged and finally
(just how
soon we cannot tell, but the city seems to have been at peace again
at least in 264) took the Brucheium.
Valesius and others think of a
later siege under Claudius, but that seems to me too late (see Tille
mont, Hist, des EmA, III. p. 345 sq.).

ANATOLIUS ON THE DATE OF THE PASSOVER.

3 IQ

There Eusebius, like a father and physician,
received all of them, wasted away through the
long siege, and restored them by every kind
of prudence and care.
The church of
Laodicea was honored by two such pastors
in succession, who, in the providence of God,
came after the aforesaid war from Alexandria to

that city.

Anatolius did not write very many works;
but in such as have come down to us we
can discern his eloquence and erudition.
In
these he states particularly his opinions on the
passover.
It seems important to give here the
following extracts from them."

From the Pascha/ Canons of Anatolius.
"There is then in the first year the new
moon of the first month, which is the begin
ning of every cycle of nineteen years," on the
twenty-sixth day of the Egyptian Phamenoth; *
but according to the months of the Macedoni
ans, the twenty-second day of Dystrus," or, as
the Romans would say, the eleventh before
the Kalends of April. On the said twenty
sixth of Phamenoth, the sun is found not
only entered on the first segment," but already
passing through the fourth day in it. They are
accustomed to call this segment the first dodeca
tomorion," and the equinox, and the beginning
of months, and the head of the cycle, and the
starting-point of the planetary circuit.
But they
call the one preceding this the last of months,
and the twelfth segment, and the final dodecato
morion, and the end of the planetary circuit.
Wherefore we maintain that those who place
the first month in it, and determine by it the
fourteenth of the passover, commit no slight
or common blunder. And this is not an
opinion of our own ; but it was known to
the Jews of old, even before Christ, and was
carefully observed by them.
This may be
learned from what is said by Philo, Josephus,

* Anatolius' work on the passover is still extant in a Latin
translation supposed to be the work of Rufinus (though this is
uncertain), and which was first published by Aegidius Bucherius in
his Doctrina Temporum, Antwerp, 1634. Ideler (Chron. , II,
230) claims that this supposed translation of Anatolius is a work of
the seventh century.
But there are the best of reasons for supposing
it an early translation of Anatolius' genuine work (see Zahn,
Asorschungen zur Gesch. des M. T. Kanons, III. p. 177-196).
The Latin version is given with the other extant fragments of Ana
tolius' works in Migne's Pat. Gr. X. 209-222, 231-236, and an
English translation of the Paschal Canons in the Ante-Nicene
Aathers, V.I. p. 146-151. Upon this work of Anatolius, see espe
cially the works of Ideler and Zahn referred to just above.
** Anatolius was, so far as we know, the first Christian to em
£. the old Metonic nineteen-year cycle for the determination of
laster (see above, chap. 20, note 6).
* Phamenoth was the seventh month of the Alexandrian year,
which was introduced in the reign of Augustus (b.c. 25) and began
on the 29th of August. The month Phamenoth, therefore, began on
the 25th of February, and the 26th of the month corresponded to the
22d of our March.

* Dystrus was the seventh month of the Macedonian year, and
corresponded exactly with our March, so that the 22d of Dystrus was
the 22d of March, which according to the Roman method of reckon
ing was the eleventh day before the Kalends of April.

and Musaeus ; * and not only by them, but also
by those yet more ancient, the two Agathobuli,"
surnamed ‘Masters,' and the famous Aristobu
lus," who was chosen among the seventy inter
preters of the sacred and divine Hebrew Scrip
tures" by Ptolemy Philadelphus and his father,
and who also dedicated his exegetical books
on the law of Moses to the same kings. These
writers, explaining questions in regard to
the Exodus, say that all alike should sacrifice
the passover offerings after the vernal equinox,
in the middle of the first month.
But this
occurs while the sun is passing through the first
segment of the solar, or as some of them have
styled it, the zodiacal circle.
Aristobulus adds
that it is necessary for the feast of the passover,
that not only the sun should pass through the
equinoctial segment, but the moon also.
For as there are two equinoctial segments,
the vernal and the autumnal, directly oppo
site each other, and as the day of the passover
was appointed on the fourteenth of the month,
beginning with the evening, the moon will hold
a position diametrically opposite the sun, as
may be seen in full moons; and the sun will be
in the segment of the vernal equinox, and of
necessity the moon in that of the autumnal.
I know that many other things have been
said by them, some of them probable, and
some approaching absolute demonstration, by
which they endeavor to prove that it is alto
gether necessary to keep the passover and the
feast of unleavened bread after the equinox.
But I refrain from demanding this sort of demon
stration for matters from which the veil of the
Mosaic law has been removed, so that now at

* So far as I am aware, Musaeus is known to us only from this

reference of Anatolius.

27 Who the two Agathobuli were we do not know.

In the
Chron. of Eusebius a philosopher Agathobulus is mentioned under
the third year of Hadrian in connection with Plutarch, Sextus, and
(Enomaus. Walesius therefore suspects that Anatolius is in error
in putting the Agathobuli earlier than Philo and Josephus.
I must
confess, however, that the connection in which Eusebius mentions
Agathobulus in his Chron. makes it seem to me very improbable
that he can be referring to either of the Agathobuli whom Anatolius
mentions, and that it is much more likely that the latter were two
closely related Jewish writers (perhaps father and son), who lived,
as Anatolius says, before the time of Philo.

* Aristobulus was a well-known Hellenistic philosopher of Alex
andria, who lived in the time of Ptolemy Philometor in the second
century B.C. He was thoroughly acquainted with Greek philosophy,
and was in many respects the forerunner of Philo, , Anatolius' state
ment that he wrote in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and conse
uently his report that he was one of the seventy translators of the
Septuagint (on the legend, as to its composition, see Bk. V., chap.
8, note 31) must be looked upon as certainly an error (see Clement
Alex. Strom. I. 22, Eusebius' Prep. Erong. IX. 6, and XIII. 12,
and his Chron., year of Abr. 1841). He is mentioned often by
Clement of Alexandria, by Origen (Coutra Cels. IV: 51), and by
Eusebius, who in his Prao. o: (VII. 14 and VIII. Io) gives
two fragments of his work (or works). On the Mosaic Law. It is
doubtless to this same work that Anatolius refers in the present
passage. No other fragments of his writings are extant...See espe
cially Schürer, Gesch. der juden im Zeitaster Jesu Christi, II.
p. 760 sq. See also Bk. VI. chap. 23, note 13, above.

* On the origin of the LXX, see above, Bk. V. chap. 8,
note 31. The mythical character of the common legend in regard
to its composition is referred to in that note, and that the LXX (or
at least that part of it which comprises the law) was already in
existence before the time of Aristobulus is clear from the latter's
words, quoted by Eusebius, Prao. Evang. XIII. 12, 1-2 (Hein
ichen's ed.).

31 The Book of Enoch is one of the so-called Old Testament
Pseudepigrapha, which was widely used in the ancient Church, and
is quoted in the Epistle of Jude, 1.4 sq. The work disappeared after
about the fifth century, and was supposed to have perished (with
the exception of a few sragments) until in 1773 it was discovered
entire in an Ethiopic Bible, and in 1838 was published in Ethiopic
by Lawrence, who in 1821 had already translated it into English.
Ijillmann also published the Ethiopic text in 1851, and in 1853 a
German translation with commentary.
Dillmann's edition of the
original entirely supersedes that of Lawrence, and his translation
and commentary still form the standard work upon the subject.
More recently it has been re-translated into English and discussed
by George H. Schodde:, The Book of Engch, translated, with In
troduction a was votes, Andover, 1882. The literature on the book of
Enoch is very extensive. See especially Schodde's work, the German
translation of Dillmann, Schürer's Gesch. der Juden, II. p. 616 sq.,
and Lipsius' article, Enoch, A/orry//ial Book of, in the Dict. 2/
Christ. Broo.

The teachings of the book to which Anatolius refers are found
in the seventy-second chapter (Schodde's ed. p. 179 sq.), which
contains a detailed description of the course of the sun during the
various months of the year.

§§ Eusebius doubtless refers here to the final council at which
Paul was condemned, and which has been already mentioned in
chaps. 29 and 30 (on its date, see chap. 29, note 1). That it is this
particular council to which he refers is implied in the way in which
it is spoken of, - as if referring to the well-known synod, of which
so much has been said, - and still further by the fact that Eusebius,
who had attended the first one (see above, § 5), and had then become
bishop of Laodicea, was already dead.
* Of Stephen, bishop of Laodicea, we know only what Eusebius

tells us in this passage.

* Theodotus, of whom Eusebius speaks in such high terms in
this passage, was bishop of Laodicea for a great many years, and
played a prominent part in the Arian controversy, being one of the
most zealous supporters of the Arian cause (see Theodoret, H. E.
1.5 and V. 7, and Athanasius de Synod's A rim. et Seleuc. I. 17).
He was present at the Council of Nicaea (Labbe, Concil. II. 51),
and took part in the council which deposed Eustathius of Antioch,
in 330 (according to Theodoret, AZ. F. I. 21, whose account, though
unreliable, is very likely correct so far as its list of bishops is con
cerned; on the too. see also p. 21, above). He was already

fairs, being straightway made bishop of that
parish by God himself, the Saviour of all. He
justified by his deeds both his lordly name *
and his office of bishop.
For he excelled in
the medical art for bodies, and in the healing art
for souls.
Nor did any other man equal him in
kindness, sincerity, sympathy, and zeal in help
ing such as needed his aid. He was also greatly
devoted to divine learning.
Such an one was
he.

In Caesarea in Palestine, Agapius" suc
ceeded Theotecnus, who had most zealously
performed the duties of his episcopate. Him
too we know to have labored diligently, and to
have manifested most genuine providence in his
oversight of the people, particularly caring
for all the poor with liberal hand.
In his
time we became acquainted with Pamphi

sophical life, who was esteemed worthy of the
office of presbyter in that parish.

dead in the year 341; for his successor, George, was present at the
Council of Antioch (/n Encaensis), which was held in that year (see
Sozomen, H. E. III.5, and cf. Hesele, Conciliengesch. I. p. 592 sq.).
We have no information that he was present at §. Council of Tyre,
in 335 (as is incorrectly stated by Labbe, who confounds The
of ii. with Theodotus; see Theodoret, H. E. l. 28).
It is,
therefore, possible that he was dead at that time, though his absence
of course does not prove it.
According to Socrates, H. E. II. 46,
and Sozomen, H. A. VI. 25, Theodotus had trouble with the two
Apolinarii, father and son, who resided at Antioch. We do not
know the date of the younger Apolinarius' birth (the approximate
date, 335, given in the article in the Dr. f. of Christ. Biog, is a gross
error), but we can hardly put it much earlier than 320, and therefore
as he was a reader in o church, according to Socrates (Sozomen
calls him only a youth) in the time of Theodotus, it seems best to
put the death, of the latter as late as possible, perhaps well on
toward 340. The date of his accession is unknown to us; but as
Eusebius says that he became bishop straightway after the fall of
Stephen, we cannot well put his accession later than 31 1: so that he
held office in all probability some thirty years. Venables' article on
Theodotus, in the 19;rt. of Christ. Bros. is a tissue of errors, caused
by identifying Theodotus with Theodore of Heraclea (an error com
mitted by Labbe before him) and with another Theodotus, present
at the Council of Seleucia, in 359 (Athanasius, food. I. 12; cf. Hefele,
Concilicogesch. ło, 713).

* 9, odoros: "God-given."
* Of Agapius we know only what Eusebius tells us in this pas
sage. He was the immediate predecessor of Eusebius in the church
of Caesarea, and probably survived the persecution, but not for many
years (see above, p. 10 sq.).
Eusebius speaks of him in the past
tense, so that he was§ already dead at the time this part of the
Hijoy was written (i.e. probably in 313; see above, p. 45).
* Pamphilus, a presbyter of Caesarea, was Eusebius' teacher and
most intimate friend, ... his death Eusebius showed his affec
tion and respect, for him by adopting his name, styling himself
Eusebius Pamphili. He pursued his studies in Alexandria (accord
ing to Photius, under Pierius, more probably under Achillas, the
head of the catechetical school there; see below, notes 42 and 53),
and conceived an unbounded admiration for Origen, the great light
of that school, which he never lost.
Pamphilus is chiefly celebrated
for the library which he collected at Caesarea and to which Eusebius
owes a large part of the materials of his history. Jerome also made
extensive use of it.
It was especially rich in copies of the Scripture,
of cominentaries upon it, and of Origen's works (see above, p. 38).
He wrote very little, devoting himself chiefly to the study of Scrip
ture, and to the transcription of MSS. of it and of the works of
Origen. , During the last two years of his life, however, while in
prison, he wrote with the assistance of Eusebius a 19efense o

41 On Eusebius' Life of Pamphilus, see above, p. 28 sq.
** According to Jerome (de zir. o. 76) Pierius was a presbyter
and a teacher in Alexandria under the emperors Carus and Diocle
tian, while Theonas was bishop there (see note 51, below), on
account of the elegance of his writings was called "the younger
Origen," was skilled, moreover, in dialectics and rhetoric, lived
an ascetic life, and passed his later years, after the persecution, in
Rome.
According to Photius, Coa'. I 18, he was at the head of the
catechetical school of Alexandria, was the teacher of Pamphilus,
and finally suffered martyrdom.
Photius may be correct in the
former statements. The last statement is at variance with Jerome's
distinct report, which in the present instance at least is to be de
cidedly preferred to that of Photius. The first statement also is
subject to grave doubt, for according to Eusebius (§ 30, below),
Achillas, who was made presbyter at the same time as Pierius, and
who lived until after the persecution (when he became bishop), was
principal of the school.
Eusebius' statement must be accepted as
correct, and in that case it is difficult to believe the report of Photius,
both on account of Eusebius' silence in regard to Picrius' connec
tion with the school, and also because if Pierius was principal of
the school, he must apparently have given it up while he was still in
Alexandria, or must have left the city earlier than Jerome says.
It is more probable that Photius' report is false and rests upon a
combination of the accounts of Eusebius and Jerome.
If both the
first and third statements of Photius are incorrect, little faith can be
placed on the second, which may be true, or, which may be simply
a combination of the known fact that Pamphilus studied in Alexan
dria with the supposed fact that Pierius was the principal of the
catechetical school while he was there.
It is quite as probable that
Pamphilus studied with Achillas. Jerome tells us that a number of
works (tractatuum) by Pierius were extant in his day, among
them a long homily on Hosea (cf. also Jerome's Comment. In
Osee, Arologus). £, his second epistle to Pammachius (Migne,
No. 49) Jerome refers also to Pierius' commentary on First Cor
inthians, and quotes from it the words, "In saying this Paul openly
reaches celibacy."
Photius, Cod. I 19, mentions a work in twelve
oks, whose title he does not name, but in which he tells us
Pierius had uttered some dangerous sentiments in regard to the
Spirit, pronouncing him inferior, to the Father and the Son. This
work contained, according to Photius, a book on Luke's Gospel,
and another on the Passover, and on Hosea.
Pierius' writings are
no longer extant. The passages from Jerome's epistle to Pam
machius and from Photius, Ced. 119, are given, with notes, by
Routh, Red. Sac. 2d ed. III. 429 sq., and an English translation in
the Ante-Asiaene Fathers, V.I. p. 157.
Pierius was evidently a
"younger Origen" in his theology as well as in his literary charac
ter, as we can gather from Photius' account of him (cf. Harnack's
Pogutenge sch. I. p. 640).
* A Meletius, o of Sabastopolis, is mentioned by Philostor
gius (H. E. I. 8) as in attendance upon the Council of Nicaea, and
it is commonly assumed that this is the same one referred to here by
Eusebius.
But Eusebius' words seem to me to imply clearly that
the Meletius of whom he speaks was already dead at the time he
wrote; and, therefore, if we suppose that Philostorgius is referring
to the same man, we must conclude that he was mistaken in his
statement, possibly confounding him with the later Meletius of
Sebaste, asterwards of Antioch. Our Meletius is, however, doubt
less to be identified with the orthodox Meletius mentioned in terms
of praise by Athanasius, in his EA. ad /o/isc. o. § 8, and by
Basil in his />e Soir. Sanct. chap. 29, § 74.
It is suggested by
Stroth that Eusebius was a pupil of Melctius during the time that
the latter was in Palestine, but this is not implied in Eusebius' words
(see above, p. 5).

would be impossible to admire sufficiently his
rhetorical skill.
It might be said that he pos

the excellence of his great experience and
erudition in other respects?
For in all
branches of knowledge had you undertaken
to try him even once, you would have said that
he was the most skillful and learned. More
over, the virtues of his life were not less remark
able. We observed him well in the time of the

know nothing about this bishop, cxcept what is told us here and in
the Chron., where he is called the thirty-eighth bishop (Jerome calls
him the thirty-seventh, but incorrectly according to his own list)
and is said to have entered upon his office in the fifteenth year o
Diocletian (Armen. fourteenth), i.e. in 298. Hermon succeeded him

Macharius is put by Jerome in the eighth year of Constantine,
A.D. 312.
Eusebius' words seem to imply that Hermon was still
bishop at the time he was writing, though it is not certain that he
means to say that.
Jerome's date may be incorrect, but is probably
not far out of the way. Of Hermon himself we know nothing more.

agree with the History in assigning nineteen years to his epis
copate. An interesting and admirable epistle is extant addressed
to Lucian, the chief "... of the emperor, and containing
advice in regard to the duties of his position, which is commonly
and without doubt correctly ascribed to Thconas. The name of
the emperor is not given, łł all of the circumstances point to
Diocletian, who had a number of Christians in influential posi
tions in his household during the earlier years of his reign. The
epistle, which is in Latin (according to some a translation of a Greek
original), is given by Routh, Red. Sac. I I I. 439-445, and an Eng
lish translation is contained in the Ante-Vicene Fathers, V. I.
p. 158-161.

* The character given to Achillas by Eusebius is confirmed by
Athanasius, who calls him "the great Achillas" (in his Epist/e to
the /8 shops of Aegypt, § 23). He succeeded Peter as bishop of
Alexandria (Épiphanius makes him the successor of Alexander, but
wrongly, for the testimony of Athanasius, to say nothing of Jerome,
Socrates, and other writers, is decisive on this point; see Athanasius'
A/oãogy against the A1 roots, S$ 11 and 50, and Aeost. to the Asso
ofs of Egypt, § 23), but our authorities differ as to the date of his
accession and the length of his episcopate.
Eusebius, in this chapter,
§ 31, puts the death of Peter in the ninth year of the persecution
311-312), and with this Jerome agrees in his Chron, and there can
be no doubt as to the correctness of the report. But afterwards, quite
inconsistently (unless it be supposed that Achillas, became bishop
before Peter's death, which, in the face of Eusebius' silence on the
subject, is very improbable), Jerome puts the accession of Achillas
into the fifth year of Constantine, A. D. 309. Jerome commits an
other error in putting the accession of his successor, Alexander,
in the sixteenth year of Constantine (A.D. 322); for Alexander's

After Theonas had held the office
for nineteen years, Peter* received the
episcopate in Alexandria, and was very eminent
among them for twelve entire years. Of these
he governed the church less than three years
before the persecution, and for the remainder of
his life he subjected himself to a more rigid
discipline and cared in no secret manner for the
general interest of the churches. On this ac
count he was beheaded in the ninth year of the
persecution, and was adorned with the crown of
martyrdom.

(see below, Bk. VIII. chap. 14, note 2). According to this passage,
Peter was bishop less than three years before the outbreak of i.
persecution, and hence he cannot have become bishop before the
spring of 3oo. On the other hand since he died as early as the
spring of 312, and was bishop twelve years he must, have become
bishop not later than the spring of 3oo, and he must have died not
long before the spring of 312, and even then, is Eusebius' other state
ments are exact, it is impossible to make his episcopate fully twelve
years in length. The date thus, obtained for his accession is in
accord with the dates given for the episcopate of his predecessor
Theonas (see above, note 51).
Jerome puts his accession in the
nineteenth year of Diocletian (A.D. 302), but this is at variance
with his own figures in connection with Theonas, and is plainly
incorrect.

controversy with Arius (see above, p. 11 sq.) can hardly, have
broken out later than 318 or 319, and it would appear that Alexan
der had been bishop already some time when that took place. Theo
doret (H. E. I. 2) states that Achillas ruled the church but a short
time, and with him agrees Epiphanius (Harr. LXIX. 11), who
says that he held office but three months. The casual way in which
Achillas is spoken of in all our sources, most of which mention him
only in passing from Peter to Alexander, would seem to confirm
Theodoret's report, and Alexander's accession may, therefore, be
put not long after 311.

Fourteen Canons, containing detailed directions in regard to the
lapsed were drawn up by Peter in 306 (see the opening sentence of
the first canon), and are still extant. They are published in all col

INTRODUCTION.

As we have described in seven books the
events from the time of the apostles,' we think
it proper in this eighth book to record for the
information of posterity a few of the most im
portant occurrences of our own times, which are
worthy of permanent record.
Our account will
begin at this point.

CHAPTER I.

The Events which preceded the Persecution in
our /imes.

It is beyond our ability to describe in a
suitable manner the extent and nature of
the glory and freedom with which the word of
piety toward the God of the universe, proclaimed
to the world through Christ, was honored among
all men, both Greeks and barbarians, be
fore the persecution in our day. The favor
shown our people by the rulers might be
adduced as evidence; as they committed to
them the government of provinces," and on ac
count of the great friendship which they enter
tained toward their doctrine, released them
from anxiety in regard to sacrificing. Why
need I speak of those in the royal palaces,
and of the rulers over all, who allowed the
members of their households, wives" and chil
dren and servants, to speak openly before them
for the Divine word and life, and suffered them
almost to boast of the freedom of their faith?
Indeed they esteemed them highly, and
preferred them to their fellow-servants. Such
an one was that Dorotheus," the most de

Prisca, the wife, and Valeria, the daughter, of Dio
cletian, and the wife of Galerius, were very friendly to the Christians,
and indeed there can be little doubt that they were themselves Chris
tians, or at least catechumens, though they kept the fact secret
and sacrificed to the gods (Lactantius, De mort. Aers. 15) when
all of Diocletian's household were required to do so, after the second
conflagration in the palace (see Mason's Persecution of Diocletian,
p. 40, 121 sq.).
It is probable in the present case that Eusebius is
thinking not simply of the wives of Diocletian and Galerius, but
also of all the women and children connected in any way with the
imperial household.

* Of this Dorotheus we know only what is told us here and in
chap. 6, below, where it is reported that he was put to death by
strangling.
It might be thought at first sight that he is to be iden
tified with the Dorotheus mentioned above in Bk. VII. chap. 32, for
both lived at the same time, and the fact that the Dorotheus men
tioned there was a eunuch would fit him for a promiae...it station in

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[VIII. I

And those esteemed our shepherds,
casting
aside the bond of piety, were excited to con
flicts with one another, and did nothing else
than heap up strifes and threats and jealousy
and enmity and hatred toward each other, like
tyrants eagerly endeavoring to assert their power.
Then, truly, according to the word of Jeremiah,
"The Lord in his wrath darkened the daughter
of Zion, and cast down the glory of Israel from
heaven to earth, and remembered not his foot
stool in the day of his anger. The Lord also
overwhelmed all the beautiful things of Is
rael, and threw down all his strongholds.""
And according to what was foretold in the
Psalms: "He has made void the covenant
of his servant, and profaned his sanctuary to the
earth, - in the destruction of the churches, -
and has thrown down all his strongholds, and
All that

people; and he has become besides a reproach
to his neighbors.
For he has exalted the right
hand of his enemies, and has turned back the
help of his sword, and has not taken his part in
the war.
But he has deprived him of purifica
tion, and has cast his throne to the ground. He
has shortened the days of his time, and besides
all, has poured out shame upon him.""

CHAPTER II.

The Destruction of the Churches.

ALL these things were fulfilled in us, when
we saw with our own eyes the houses of
prayer thrown down to the very foundations, and
the Divine and Sacred Scriptures committed to
the flames in the midst of the market-places, and
the shepherds of the churches basely hidden
here and there, and some of them captured
ignominiously, and mocked by their enemies.
When also, according to another prophetic word,
"Contempt was poured out upon rulers, and
he caused them to wander in an untrodden and

pathless way." "

But it is not our place to describe the sad
misfortunes which finally came upon them,
as we do not think it proper, moreover, to
record their divisions and unnatural conduct to
each other before the persecution.
Wherefore
we have decided to relate nothing concerning
them except the things in which we can vin
dicate the Divine judgment.
Hence we
shall not mention those who were shaken
by the persecution, nor those who in everything
pertaining to salvation were shipwrecked, and
by their own will were sunk in the depths of the

* Lam, ii. 1, 2.
* Ps. cwii. 49.

* Ps. lxxxix. 39-45.

flood.
But we shall introduce into this history
in general only those events which may be use
ful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity."
Let us therefore proceed to describe briefly the
sacred conflicts of the witnesses of the Divine
Word.

It was in the nineteenth year of the reign
of Diocletian," in the month Dystrus," called
March by the Romans, when the feast of the
Saviour's passion was near at hand," that royal
edicts were published everywhere, commanding
that the churches be leveled to the ground and
the Scriptures be destroyed by fire, and order
ing that those who held places of honor be
degraded, and that the household servants, if
they persisted in the profession of Christianity,
be deprived of freedom."

* Gibbon uses this passage as the basis for his severe attack upon
the honesty of Eusebius ( /), conc and Faso, chap. 16), but he o
certainly done our author injustice (cf. the remarks made on p.
49, above).

* Diocletian began to reign Sept. 17, 284, and therefore his nine
teenth year extended from Sept. 17, 302, to Sept. 16, 393. Eusebius
is in agreement with all our authorities in assigning this year for the
beginning of the persecution, and is certainly correct.
In regard to
the month, however, he is not so accurate.
Lactantius, who was in
Nicomedia at the time of the beginning of the persecution, and cer
tainly much better informed than Eusebius in regard to the details,
states distinctly (in his De mort, pers. chap. 12) that the festival of
the god Terminus, the seventh day before the Kalends of March
(i.e. Feb. 23), was chosen by the emperors for the opening of the
persecution, and there is no reason for doubting his exact statement.
At the beginning of the J/artyrs of Palestowe (p. 342, below) the
month Xanthicus (April) is given as the date, but this is still further
out of the way.
It was probably March or even April before the
edicts were published in many parts of the empire, and Eusebius
may have been misled by that fact, not knowing the exact date of
their publication in Nicomedia itself. We learn from Lactantius
that on February 23d the great church of Nicomedia, together with
the copics of Scripture found in it, was destroyed by order of the
emperors, but that the edict of which Eusebius speaks just below

the accounts of Eusebius and Lactantius. The interpretation of the

edict has caused a vast deal of trouble.
Mason in his important work, The Persecution of Diocărtiary,
p. 105 sq. and p. 343 sq.
As he remarks, Lactantius simply de
scribes the edict in a general way, while Eusebius gives an accurate
statement of its substance, even reproducing its language in part.
The first provision (that the churches be leveled to the ground) is
simply a carrying out of the old principle, that it was unlawful for
the Christians to hold assemblies, under a new form. The second
provision, directed against the sacred books, was entirely new, and
was a very shrewd move, revealing at the same time an appre
ciation on the part of the authors of the persecution of the important
part which the Scriptures occupied in the Christian Church. The
third provision, as Mason has pointed out, is a substantial reproduc
tion of a part of the edict of Valerian, and was evidently con

ture nor death is decreed, but only civil degradation.
This degrada
tion, as can be seen from a comparison with the description of Lac
tantius (food. chap. 13) and with the edict of Valerian (given in
Cyprian's Epistle to Successus, Ep. No. 81, al. 80), consisted, in
the case of those who held public office (runs & Teamus, evows), in
the loss of rank and alsoo that is, they fell through
two grades, as is pointed out by Mason. In the interpretation of the
fourth provision, however, Mason does not seem to me to have been
so successful. The last clause runs rows & voixetiats, et on oue

difficult point is the interpretation of the rows v otrerials. The
words usually mean "household slaves," and are commonly so
translated in this passage.
But, as Valesius remarks, there is cer
tainly no sense then in depriving them of freedom ("Aev6epta) which

VIII. 3..]

BEGINNINGS OF THE GREAT PERSECUTION.

Such was the first edict against us.

But
not long after, other decrees were issued,
commanding that all the rulers of the churches
in every place be first thrown into prison, and
mentioned in the previous clause. The only objection, but in my
opinion a fatal objection, to this attractive interpretation is that it
gives the phrase ot ov oixetiais a wider meaning than can legiti
mately be applied to it. Mason remarks: "The word oikeria
means, and is here a translation of, familia; ot ov oikerials means
if ytos in fant flirs sunt, - not graceful Latin certainly, but plainly
signifying ‘those who live in private households." Now in private
households there lived not only slaves, thank goodness, but free
men too, both as masters and as servants; therefore in the phrase
rows voike stats itself there is nothing which forbids the paraphrase
"private persons.'"
But I submit that to use so clumsy a phrase,
so unnecessary a circumlocution, to designate simply private people
in general - of ToaAoi - would be the height of absurdity. The in
terpretation of Stroth (which is approved by Heinichen) seems to me
much more satisfactory. He remarks: "T)as Edict war zunichst
nus gegen zwei, Klassen von Leuten gerichtet, einmal gegen die,
welche in kaiserlichen, AEmtern standen, und dann gegen die freien
oder freigelassenen Christen, welche bei den Kaisern oder ihren
Hofleuten und Statthaltern in Diensten standen, und zu ihrem Haus
gesinde gehörten." . This seems to me more satisfactory, both on
verbal and historical grounds. The words of evoixetta is certainly
cannot, in the present case, mean "household slaves," but they can
mean servants, attendants, or other persons at court, or in the
households of provincial officials, who did not hold rank as offi
cials, but at the same time were freemen born, or freedmen, and
thus in a different condition from slaves.
Such persons would natu
rally be reduced to slavery if degraded at all, and it is easier to think
of their reduction to slavery than of that of the entire mass of
Christians not in public office.
Still further, this proposition finds
support in the edict of Valerian; in which this class of people is es
pecially mentioned. And finally, it is, in my opinion, much more
i.Y., suppose that this edict (whose purpose I shall discuss on
p. 399) was confined to persons who were in some way connected
with official life, - either as chiefs or assistants or servants, - and
therefore in a position peculiarly fitted for the formation of plots
against the government, than that it was directed against Christians
indiscriminately. The grouping together of the two classes seems
to me very natural; and the omission of any specific reference to
bishops and other church officers, who are mentioned in the second
edict, is thus fully explained, as it cannot be adequately explained,
in my opinion, on any other ground.

* As we learn from chap. 6, § 8, the edict commanding the
church officers to be seized and thrown into prison followed popular
uprisings in Melitene and Syria, and if Eusebius is correct, was
caused by those outbreaks.
Evidently the Christians were held in
some way responsible for those ...}. outbursts (possibly they
were a direct consequence of the first edict), and the natural o
of them must have been to make Diocletian realize, as he had not
realized before, that the existence of such a society as the Christian
Church within the empire - demanding as it did supreme allegiance
from its members - was a menace to the state.
It was therefore not
strange that what began as a purely political thing, as an attempt
to break up a supposed treasonable plot formed by certain Christian
officials, should speedily develop into a religious persecution. The
first step in such a persecution would naturally be the seizure of all
church officers (see below, p. 397 sq.).
The decrees of which Eusebius speaks in this paragraph are evi
dently to be identified with the one mentioned in .. 6, § 8.
This
being so, it is clear that Eusebius' account can lay no claims to
chronological order.
This must be remembered, or we shall fall
into repeated difficulties in reading this eighth book. We are obliged
to arrange the order of events for ourselves, for his account is quite
desultory, and devoid both of logical and chronological sequence.
The decrees or writings (ypiu.uata) mentioned in this paragraph con
stituted really but one edict (cf. chap. 6, § 8), which is !. to us as
the Second Edict of Diocletian.
Its date cannot be determined with
exactness, for, as Mason remarks, it may have been issued at any
time between February and November; but it was probably pub
lished not many months after the first, inasmuch as it was a result
of disturbances which arose in consequence of the first. Mason is
inclined to place it in March, within a month after the issue of the

Diocletian followed the example of Valerian in F. and yet only in
part; for instead of commanding that the church officers be slain, he
commanded only that they be seized. He evidently believed that
he could accomplish his purpose best by getting the leading men of
the church into his hands and holding them oilo. while deny
ing them the glory of martyrdom (cf. Mason, p. 132 sq.). The per
sons affected by the edict, according to Eusebius, were "all the
rulers of the churches '' (rous row oxxAmor cow mpotópovs to vras; cf.
also 1/art. Pa /. Introd., § 2).
In chap. 6, § 8, he says Tows morta
xo~e row oxx Amo tow rpoeo rotas. *i. words would seem to
imply that only the bishops were intended, but we learn from Lac
tantius (De mort. Aers. 15) that presbyters and other officers (A res
&yteri ac ministri) were included, and this is confirmed, as Mason
remarks (p. 133, note), by the sequel. We must therefore take the
words used by Eusebius in the general sense of "church officers."
According to Lactantius, their families suffered with them (com
omnibus suis deducedantur), but Eusebius says nothing of that.

afterwards by every artifice be compelled to

CHAPTER III.

7%e AWature of the Conflicts endured in the
Aersecution.

l

THEN truly a great many rulers of the
churches eagerly endured terrible sufferings,
and furnished examples of noble conflicts.
But
a multitude of others,' benumbed in spirit by
fear, were easily weakened at the first onset.
Of the rest each one endured different forms of
torture." The body of one was scourged with
rods.
Another was punished with insupportable
rackings and scrapings, in which some suf
fered a miserable death.
Others passed
through different conflicts. Thus one, while
those around pressed him on by force and
dragged him to the abominable and impure sac
rifices, was dismissed as if he had sacrificed,
though he had not."
Another, though he had
not approached at all, nor touched any polluted

* We learn from Lactantius (3.c.) that the officers of the church,
under the terms of the second edict, were thrown into prison without
any option being given them in the matter of sacrificing. They
were not asked to sacrifice, but were imprisoned unconditionally.
This was so far in agreement with Valerian's edict, which had de
creed the instant death of all church officers without the option of

called upon to sacrifice, and as he tells us in the first paragraph of
the next chapter, multitudes yielded, and that of course meant their
release, as indeed we are directly told in chap. 6, § 10. We may
gather from the present passage and from the other passages referred
to, taken in connection with the second chapter of the J/artyrs of
Palestine, that this decree, ordaining their release on condition of
sacrificing, was issued on the occasion of Diocletian's Vicennalia,
which were celebrated in December, 303, on the twentieth anniver
sary of the death of Carus, which Diocletian reckoned as the begin
ning of his reign, though he was not in reality emperor until the
following September. A considerable time, therefore, elapsed be
tween the edict ordaining the imprisonment of church officers and
the edict commanding their release upon condition of sacrificing.
This latter is commonly known as Diocletian's Third Edict, and is
usually spoken of as still harsher than any that preceded it.
It is
true that it did result in the torture of a great many, - for those
who did not sacrifice readily were to be compelled to . so, if possi
ble, - but their death was not aimed at.
If they would not sacrifice,
they were simply to remain in prison, as before. Those who did
die at this time seem to have died under torture that was intended,
not to kill them, but to bring about their release. As Mason shows,
then, this third edict was of the nature of an amnesty; was rather
a step toward toleration than a sharpening of the persecution. The
prisons were to be emptied, as was customary on such great occa
sions, and the church officers were to be permitted to return to
their homes, on condition that they should sacrifice.
Inasmuch as
they had not been allowed to leave prison on any condition before,
this was clearly a mark of favor (see Mason, p. 206 sq.). Many were
released even without sacrificing, and in their desire to empty the
prisons, the governors devised various expedients for freeing at least
a part of those who would not yield (cf. the instances mentioned in
the next chapter).
At the same time, some governors got rid of
their prisoners by putting them to death, sometimes simply by in
creasing the severity of the tortures intended to try them, sometimes
as a penalty for rash or daring words uttered by the prisoners, which
were interpreted as treasonable, and which, perhaps, the officials
had employed their ingenuity, when necessary, to elicit. .
. Thus
many might suffer death, under various legal pretenses, although
the terms of the edict did not legally permit death to be inflicted as
a punishment for Christianity. The death penalty was not decreed
until the issue of the Fourth Edict (see below, J/art. Pas. chap.
3, note 2).

- i.e. those who, when freedom was offered them on condition of
sacrificing, refused to accept it at that price.
It was desirous that
the prisons which had for so long been filled with these Christian
prisoners (see chap. 6, § 9) should, is possible, be cleared; and this
doubtless combined with the desire to break the stubbornness of the
prisoners to promote the use of torture at this time.

Another being taken up half dead, was cast

One cried

that he had not sacrificed and never would.

by a large band of soldiers who were drawn
up for this purpose; and they were smitten

For we might tell of many who showed
admirable zeal for the religion of the God
of the universe, not only from the beginning of
the general persecution, but long before
that time, while yet peace prevailed.
For
though he who had received power was
seemingly aroused now as from a deep sleep,
yet from the time after Decius and Valerian,
he had been plotting secretly and without no
tice against the churches. He did not wage
war against all of us at once, but made trial at
first only of those in the army.
For he sup
posed that the others could be taken easily if
he should first attack and subdue these. There
upon many of the soldiers were seen most cheer
fully embracing private life, so that they might
not deny their piety toward the Creator of

* In the Chron. we are told of a commander by name Veturius,
who is doubtless to be identified with the one referred to here. Why
Eusebius does not give his name in the History, we do not know.
There seems to be contempt in the phrase, "whoever he was," and
it may be that he did not consider him worth naming.
In Jerome's
version of the Chron. (sixteenth year of Diocletian) we read:

Evidently the occurrence took place a few years before the outbreak
of the regular persecution, but the exact date cannot be determined.

the man in the History that he was a comparatively insignificant
commander, who took the course he did on i. own responsibility.

who were enrolled in the army, giving them the
choice either by obeying to receive the honor

without hesitation, instantly preferred the con
fession of him to the seeming glory and
prosperity which they were enjoying. And
one and another of them occasionally re

not only the loss of position, but death.
But
as yet the instigator of this plot proceeded with
moderation, and ventured so far as blood only
in some instances; for the multitude of believ
ers, as it is likely, made him afraid, and deterred
him from waging war at once against all.
But when he made the attack more boldly,
it is impossible to relate how many and
what sort of martyrs of God could be seen,
among the inhabitants of all the cities and
countries."

CHAPTER V.

Those in Micomedia."

IMMEDIATELY on the publication of the
decree against the churches in Nicomedia,"
a certain man, not obscure but very highly
honored with distinguished temporal dignities,
moved with zeal toward God, and incited with
ardent faith, seized the edict as it was posted
openly and publicly, and tore it to pieces as a
profane and impious thing; * and this was done

At least, there is no reason to connect the act with Diocletian and to
suppose it ordered by him.
All that we know of his relation to the
Christians forbids such a supposition. There may have been some
particular occasion for such a move in the present instance, which
evidently affected only a small part of the army, and resulted in only
a few deaths (see the next paragraph).
Perhaps some insubordi
nation was discovered among the Colia. soldiers, which led the
commander to be suspicious of all of them, and hence to put the
test to them, - which was always in order, - to prove their loyalty.
It is plain that he did not intend to put any of them to o, but
only to dismiss such as refused to evince their loyalty by offering
the customary sacrifices. Some of the Christian soldiers, however,
were not content with simple dismission, but in their eagerness, to
evince their Christianity said and did things which it was impossible
for any commander to overlook (cf. the instances given by Mason,
p. 41 sq.).
It was such soldiers as these that suffered death; and
they of course were executed, not because they were Christians, but
because they were insubordinate.
Their death was brought on
themselves by their foolish fanaticism; and they have no claim to be
lood as martyrs, although Eusebius evidently regarded them as

-

* In this sentence reference is made to the general persecution,
which did not begin until some time after the events recorded in the
previous paragraphs.

* Nicomedia, the capital city of Bithynia, became Diocletian's
chief place of residence, and was made by him the Eastern capital of
the empire.
* The great church of Nicomedia was destroyed on Feb. 23, 303,
and the First Edict was published on the following day (see above,
chap. 2, note 3).

& Lactantius relates this account in his De mort. foers. chap.
13, and expresses disapproval of the act, while admiring the
spirit of the man.
He, too, is silent in regard to the name of the
man, though, living as he did in Nicomedia, he can hardly have
been ignorant of it. We may perhaps imagine that he did not
care to perpetuate the name of a man whom he considered to have
acted rashly and illegally. The old martyrologies give the man's

city, - the oldest of all, and the one who held the
fourth place in the government after him."
But this man, first in that place, after dis
tinguishing himself in such a manner suf
fered those things which were likely to follow
such daring, and kept his spirit cheerful and
undisturbed till death.

CHAPTER VI.

Those in the Palace.

This period produced divine and illus
trious martyrs, above all whose praises have
ever been sung and who have been celebrated
for courage, whether among Greeks or barba
rians, in the person of Dorotheus' and the ser
vants that were with him in the palace. Although
they received the highest honors from their mas
ters, and were treated by them as their own
children, they esteemed reproaches and trials
for religion, and the many forms of death that
were invented against them, as, in truth, greater
riches than the glory and luxury of this life.

We will describe the manner in which one of
them ended his life, and leave our readers to infer
from his case the sufferings of the others.
A certain man was brought forward in the
above-mentioned city, before the rulers of
whom we have spoken." He was then com
manded to sacrifice, but as he refused, he was
ordered to be stripped and raised on high and
beaten with rods over his entire body, until,
being conquered, he should, even against
his will, do what was commanded.
But as
he was unmoved by these sufferings, and
his bones were already appearing, they mixed
vinegar with salt and poured it upon the man
gled parts of his body.
As he scorned these
agonies, a gridiron and fire were brought for
ward.
And the remnants of his body, like flesh
intended for eating, were placed on the fire, not
at once, lest he should expire instantly, but a
little at a time. And those who placed him on
the pyre were not permitted to desist until, after
such sufferings, he should assent to the
things commanded.
But he held his pur
pose firmly, and victoriously gave up his

name as John. That he deserved death is clear enough. He was
not a martyr to the faith, but a criminal, who was justly executed
for treasonable conduct. The first edict contemplated no violence

in consequence of their own rashness, as in the present case.
It is
clear that such an incident as this would anger Diocletian and in
crease his suspicions of Christians as a class, and thus tend to pre
cipitate a regular persecution.
It must have seemed to the authori
ties that the man would hardly commit such a foolhardy act unless
he was conscious of the support of a large body of the populace, and
so the belief in the wide extension of the plot which had caused the
movement on the part of the emperors must have been confirmed.

life while the tortures were still going on.
Such
was the martyrdom of one of the servants of the
palace, who was indeed well worthy of his
name, for he was called Peter." The martyrdoms of the rest, though they were not infe
rior to his, we will pass by for the sake of brevity,
recording only that Dorotheus and Gorgonius, with
many others of the royal household, after varied
sufferings, ended their lives by strangling, and
bore away the trophies of God-given victory.
At this time Anthimus," who then presided over the church in Nicomedia, was
beheaded for his testimony to Christ. A great
multitude of martyrs were added to him, a con
flagration having broken out in those very days
in the palace at Nicomedia, I know not how,
which through a false suspicion was laid to our

* Térpos, "a rock."

It is clear from the account of Lactantius
(chap. 15) that this man, and the others mentioned in this connec
tion, suffered after the second conflagration in the palace and in
consequence of it (see below, p.409). The two conflagrations led
Diocletian to resort to torture in order to ascertain the guilty parties,
or to obtain information in regard to the plots of the {}}.
Examination by torture was the common mode of procedure under
such circumstances, and hence implies no unusual cruelty in the
resent case. The death even of these men, therefore, cannot be
ooked upon as due to persecution.
Their offense was purely a
civil onc. They were suspected of being implicated in a treasonable
plot, and of twice setting fire to the palace.
Their refusal to sacri
fice under such circumstances, and thus evince their loyalty at so
critical a time, was naturally looked upon as practically a confession
of guilt, - at any rate as insubordination on a most grave occasion,
and as such fitly punishable by death. Compare Pliny's epistle to
Trajan, in which he expresses the opinion that "pertinacious and
inflexible obstinacy" ought at any rate to be punished, whatever
might be thought of Christianity as such (see above, Bk. III. chap.
33, note 1); and at such a time as this Diocletian must have scl that
the first duty of all his subjects was to place their loyalty beyond
suspicion by doing readily that which was demanded. . His impa
tience with the Christians must have been increasing under all these
provocations, and thus the regular persecution was becoming ever
more imminent.

* Gorgonius has been already mentioned in chap. 1, above. Sce

note 4 on that chapter.

* In a fragment preserved by the Chron. Paschałe, and purport
ing to be a part of an epistle written from prison, shortly before his
death, by the presbyter Lucian of Antioch to the church of that
city, Anthimus, bishop of Nicomedia, is mentioned as having just
suffered martyrdom (see Routh's Rel. Sac., IV. p. 5).
Lucian,
however, was imprisoned and put to death during the persecution
of Maximinus (A.D. 311 or ...}
See below, Bk. IX. chap. 6, and
Jerome's de zir, ill. chap. 77.
It would seem, therefore, if the
fragment given in the Chron. Paschase be genuine, and there
seems no good reason to doubt it, that Anthimus suffered martyr
dom not under Diocletian, but under Maximinus, in 311 or 312.
In
that case Eusebius is mistaken in putting his death at this early
date, in connection with the members of the imperial household.
Indeed, we see no reason for his execution at this time, and should
In the time of
find it difficult to explain if we were to accept it.
Maximinus, however, it is perfectly natural, and of a picce with the
execution of Peter of Alexandria and other notable prelates. Euse
bius, as we have already seen, pays no attention to chronology in
this Eighth Book, and hence, there is no great weight to be placed
upon his mention of the death of Anthimus at this particular place.
\}. (p. 324) says that Hunziker (p. 281) has conclusively shown
Eusebius' mistake at this point.
I have not seen Hunziker, and
therefore cannot judge of the validity of his arguments, but, on the
grounds already stated, have no hesitation in expressing my agree
ment with his conclusion. Of Anthimus himself, we know nothing
beyond what has been already intimated. In chap., 13, § 1, below,
he is mentioned again, but nothing additional is told us in regard
to him.

Having observed Eusebius' mistake in regard to Anthimus, we
realize that there is no reason to consider him any more accurate in
respect to the other martyrdoms referred to in this paragraph.
In
fact, it is clear enough that, in so far as his account is not merely
rhetorical, it relates to events that took place not at this early date,
but during a later time, after the regular religious persecution had
begun. No such "multitude" suffered in consequence of the con
flagration as Eusebius thinks. The martyrdoms of which he, has
heard belong rather to the time after the Fourth Edict (see below,
j/art. Pal. chap. 3, note 2), or possibly to the still later time, when
Maximinus was at Nicomedia, and was in the midst of his bloody
career of persecution.

people."
Entire families of the pious in that
place were put to death in masses at the royal
command, some by the sword, and others by
fire.
It is reported that with a certain divine
and indescribable eagerness men and women
rushed into the fire.
And the executioners
bound a large number of others and put them
on boats' and threw them into the depths of
the sea. And those who had been es
teemed their masters considered it neces
sary to dig up the bodies of the imperial servants,
who had been committed to the earth with suit
able burial, and cast them into the sea, lest any,
as they thought, regarding them as gods, might
worship them lying in their sepulchers."

Such things occurred in Nicomedia at the
beginning of the persecution."
But not
long after, as persons in the country called
Melitene," and others throughout Syria," at

* Eusebius does not accuse Galerius of being the author of the
conflagration, as Lactantius does.
In fact, he seems to have known
very little about the matter. He mentions only one fire, whereas
Lactantius distinctly tells us there were two, fifteen days apart
(chap. 14).
Eusebius evidently has only the very vaguest informa
tion in regard to the progress of affairs at Nicomedia, and has no
knowledge of the actual order and connection of events.
In regard
to the effects of the fire upon IDiocletian's attitude toward the Chris
tians, see above, note 3, and below, p. 4oo. Constantine (Orat. ad
Sanct. Coet. XXV. 2) many years afterwards referred to the fire as
caused by lightning, ". is clearly only a makeshift, for, as
Burckhardt remarks, there could have been no doubt in that case
how the fire originated. And, moreover, such an explanation at
best could account for only one of the fires. The fact that Constan
time feels it necessary to invent such an explanation gives the occur
rence a still more suspicious look, and one not altogether favorable
to the Christians.
In fact, it must be acknowledged that the case
against them is pretty strong.
* Literally, "The executioners, having bound a large number
of others onła. threw them into the depths of the sea" (Örjaayres
ôe ot Smutot a MAo Tu TAmbos émi arx&pats, Tois Baxarriots ovarrépper
tov Buflots). The construction is cvidently a pregnant one, for it
cannot be supposed that boats and all were thrown into the depths
of the sea. They seem to have bound the prisoners, and carried
them out to sea on boats, and then thrown them overboard. Com
pare the Passion of St. Theodofos (Mason, p. 362), where we are
told that the "President then bade them hang stones about their
necks, and embark them on a small shallop and row them out to a
spot where the lake was deeper; and so they were cast into the
water at the distance of four or five hundred feet from the shore."
Cruse translates, "binding another number upon planks," but a kabn
will hardly bear that meaning; and even if it could, we should scarcely
expect men to be bound to Ala#4's if the desire was to "cast them
into the depths of the sea."
Lactantius (chap. 15), in speaking of
these same general occurrences, says, "Servants, having millstones
tied about their necks, were cast into the sea."

Closs remarks that drowning was looked upon in ancient times
as the most disgraceful punishment, because it implied that the
criminals were not worthy to receive burial.

Must. V. 11.
That in the present case the suspicion that the Chris
tians would worship the remains of these so-called martyrs was not
founded merely upon knowledge of the conduct of Christians in gen
cral in relation to the relics of their martyrs, but upon actual expe
rience of their conduct in connection with these particular martyrs,
is shown by the fact that the emperor first buried them, and afterward

and collected in such numbers about their tombs, that he believed
it was necessary to take some such step in order to prevent the growth
of a spirit of ... which was constantly fostered by such demon
strations. Compare the remarks of Mason on p. 135.

* Part of the events mentioned in this chapter occurred at the

beginning; others, a considerable time later.

See note 5, above.

* Melitene was the name of a district and a city in Eastern
Cappadocia. Upon the outbreak there we know only what can be
gathered from this passage, although Mason (p. 126 sq.) connects it
with a rebellion, of which an account is given in Simeón Metaphras
tes.
It is possible that the account of the Metaphrast is authentic,
and that the uprising referred to here is to be identified with it, but
more than that cannot be said.
There can be no doubt that the out
break was one of the causes of the promulgation of the Second Edict,
in which case of course it is clear that the Christians, whether rightly

tempted to usurp the government, a royal edict
directed that the rulers of the churches every
where * should be thrown into prison and
bonds. What was to be seen after this
exceeds all description. A vast multitude
were imprisoned in every place; and the prisons
everywhere, which had long before been pre
pared for murderers and robbers of graves,
were filled with bishops, presbyters and dea
cons, readers and exorcists," so that room was
no longer left in them for those condemned
for crimes.
And as other decrees followed
the first, directing that those in prison if
they would sacrifice should be permitted to
depart in freedom, but that those who refused
should be harassed with many tortures," how
could any one, again, number the multitude of
martyrs in every province," and especially of
those in Africa, and Mauritania, and Thebais,
and Egypt?
From this last country many went
into other cities and provinces, and became
illustrious through martyrdom.

in Antioch, of which we are told by Libânius (in his Oratio ad
Theodosium fast reconcoration, cur, and in his Oratio ad Throd.

small affair, involving only a band of some five hundred soldiers, who

entirely destroyed by the people of the city within twenty-four hours.
See the note jo. ad focum, Tillemont's Hist, des /; mp. IX.

note just referred to.

* The Third Edict of Diocletian.

Eusebius evidently looks
upon the cdict as a sharpening of the persecution, but is mistaken in
his view. The idea was not that those who refused to sacrifice
should be punished by torture for not sacrificing, but that torture
should be applied in order to induce them to sacrifice, and thus ren
der it possible to release them. The end sought was their release,
not their punishment. Upon the date and interpretation of this
edict, see chap. 2, note 8.

aimed directly at the destruction of all Christians - did not begin
until the issue of the Fourth Edict (see below, Asart. Pass. chap. 3,
note 2).
These numerous martyrdoms referred to here doubtless
belong to the period after the issue of that edict, although in Africa
and Mauritania, which were under Maximian, considerable blood
was probably shed even before that time.
For it was possible, of
course, for a cruel and irresponsible ruler like Maximian to fix the
death penalty for refusal to deliver, up the Christian books, or for
other acts of obstinacy which the Christian would quite commonly
commit. These cases, however, must be looked upon as excep
tional at this stage of affairs, and certainly rare.

" From the Martyrs of Palestine, chap. 8 sq. (more fully in
the Syriac: Cureton's English translation, p. 26 sq.), we learn that
in the sixth and following years of the persecution, many Egyptian
Christians were sent to Palestine to labor in the mines there, and
that they underwent the severest tortures in that country. No men

And as he in no

Finally, after these
terrible and various attacks upon them,
they were all slain with the sword; and instead
of being buried in the earth they were com
mitted to the waves of the sea.

We were present ourselves when these
things occurred, and have put on record
the divine power of our martyred Saviour Jesus
Christ, which was present and manifested itself
mightily in the martyrs.
For a long time the
man-devouring beasts did not dare to touch or
draw near the bodies of those dear to God, but
rushed upon the others who from the outside
irritated and urged them on. And they would
not in the least touch the holy athletes, as they
stood alone and naked and shook their hands
at them to draw them toward themselves, - for
they were commanded to do this.
But when
ever they rushed at them, they were restrained
as if by some diviner power and retreated
again.

under Maximinus, when the persecution was at its height.
Since in
his Martyrs of Palestine Eusebius confines himself to those who
suffered in that country (or were natives of it), he has nothing to
say about those referred to in this chapter, who seem, from the
opening of the next chapter, to have suffered, all of them, in Tyre.

l

SUCH was the conflict of those Egyptians
who contended nobly for religion in Tyre.
But we must admire those also who suffered
martyrdom in their native land; where thou
sands of men, women, and children, despising
the present life for the sake of the teaching
of our Saviour, endured various deaths.
Some of them, after scrapings and rackings
and severest scourgings, and numberless
other kinds of tortures, terrible even to hear
of, were committed to the flames; some were
drowned in the sea; some offered their heads
bravely to those who cut them off; some died
under their tortures, and others perished with
hunger. And yet others were crucified ; some
according to the method commonly employed
for malefactors; others yet more cruelly, being
nailed to the cross with their heads downward,
and being kept alive until they perished on the
cross with hunger.

entire body with shells instead of hooks until
they died.
Women were bound by one foot
and raised aloft in the air by machines, and with
their bodies altogether bare and uncovered, pre

together with machines, and bound the limbs
of the martyrs to them ; and then, allowing the
branches to assume their natural position, they
tore asunder instantly the limbs of those
for whom they contrived this.
All these
things were done, not for a few days or a
short time, but for a long series of years. Some
times more than ten, at other times above twenty
were put to death.
Again not less than thirty,
then about sixty, and yet again a hundred men
with young children and women, were slain in
one day, being condemned to various and

diverse torments.

We, also, being on the spot ourselves,
have observed large crowds in one day;
some suffering decapitation, others torture by
fire ; so that the murderous sword was blunted,
and becoming weak, was broken, and the very
executioners grew weary and relieved each
other. And we beheld the most wonder
ful ardor, and the truly divine energy and
zeal of those who believed in the Christ of God.
For as soon as sentence was pronounced against
the first, one after another rushed to the judg
ment seat, and confessed themselves Christians.
And regarding with indifference the terrible
things and the multiform tortures, they declared
themselves boldly and undauntedly for the re
ligion of the God of the universe. And they
received the final sentence of death with joy
and laughter and cheerfulness; so that they
sang and offered up hymns and thanksgivings
to the God of the universe till their very last

breath.

These indeed were wonderful; but yet
more wonderful were those who, being dis
tinguished for wealth, noble birth, and honor,
and for learning and philosophy, held everything
secondary to the true religion and to faith
in our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ. Such
an one was Philoromus, who held a high
office under the imperial government at Alex
andria," and who administered justice every day,
attended by a military guard corresponding to
his rank and Roman dignity.
Such also was

Walesius says that Philoromus
was the Rationalis, set, frocurator summa runo A. sypti, i.e. the
general finance minister of Egypt (see above, Bk. VII. chap. 10,
note 8).
But the truth is, that the use of the riva implies that Eu
sebius is not intending to state the particular office which he held,
but simply to indicatc that he held some high office, and this is all
that we can claim for Philoromus. We know no more of him than is
told us here, though Acts of St. Phocas and St. Philo rom us are
extant, which contain an account of his martyrdom, and are printed
by the Bollandists and by Ruinart (interesting extracts given by Tille
Tillemont
mont, //, /. V. p. 486 sq., and by Mason, p. 200 sq.).
(7&id. p. 777) and others defend their genuineness, but Lardner
doubts it (Crcoity, chap. 60)... I have examined only the co
tracts printed by Tillemont and Mason, and am not prepared to
express an opinion in the matter.

" Philcas, bishop of Thmuis (an important town in lower Egypt,
situated between the Tanite and Mendeaian branches of the Nile),
occupies an important place among the Diocletian martyrs. The
extant Acts of . martyrdom have been referred to in the previous
note. He is mentioned again by Eusebius in chaps. Io and 13, and

eminent on account of his patriotism and the ser
vices rendered by him to his country, and also
on account of his philosophical learning.
These persons, although a multitude of
relatives and other friends besought them,
and many in high position, and even the judge
himself entreated them, that they would have
compassion on themselves and show mercy to
their children and wives, yet were not in the
least induced by these things to choose the love
of life, and to despise the ordinances of our
Saviour concerning confession and denial.
But
with manly and philosophic minds, or rather
with pious and God-loving souls, they perse
vered against all the threats and insults of the
judge; and both of them were beheaded.

CHAPTER X.

The Writings of Phiseas the Martyr describing
the Occurrences at Alexandria.

SINCE we have mentioned Phileas as having a high reputation for secular learning,
let him be his own witness in the following ex
tract, in which he shows us who he was, and at
the same time describes more accurately than
we can the martyrdoms which occurred in his
time at Alexandria:"

"Having before them all these examples
and models and noble tokens which are
given us in the Divine and Sacred Scriptures,
the blessed martyrs who were with us did not
hesitate, but directing the eye of the soul in sin
cerity toward the God over all, and having their
mind set upon death for religion, they adhered
firmly to their calling.
For they understood
that our Lord Jesus Christ had become man on
our account, that he might cut off all sin and
furnish us with the means of entrance into eter

in the former a considerable part of his epistle to the people of his
diocese is quoted. Jerome mentions him in his de vir. ill, chap.
78, where he says: escoantission um iorum de martyrum laude

k referred to by Jerome seems to be identical with the epistle
quoted by Eusebius in the next chapter, for we have no record of
another work on this subject written by him.
There is extant, how
ever, the Latin version of an epistle purporting to have been written
by the imprisoned bishops Hesychius, Pachymius, Theodorus, and
Phileas, to Meletius, author of the Meletian schism. There seems
to be nothing in the epistle to disprove its genuineness, and it is
accepted by Routh and others. †. authorship of the epistle is
commonly ascribed to Philcas, both because he is known to us as a
writer, and also because his name stands last in the opening of the

Phileas' *aming is praised very highly by Eusebius and Jerome
and his scholarly character is emphasized in his Acts.
The date o
his death cannot be determined with exactness, but we may be con
fident that it did not, at any rate, take place before 306, and very
likely not before 307. The epistle quoted in the next chapter was
written shortly ico his martyrdom, as we learn from $ 11 of that
chapter.

For ‘he counted it not a prize to be
on an equality with God, but emptied himself,
taking the form of a servant; and being found in
fashion as a man, he humbled himself unto
death, even the death of the cross.'" Where
fore also being zealous for the greater gifts,
the Christ-bearing martyrs endured all trials and
all kinds of contrivances for torture; not once
only, but some also a second time. And although
the guards vied with each other in threatening
them in all sorts of ways, not in words only, but
in actions, they did not give up their resolution;

from the porch by one hand, and endured the
most terrible suffering of all, through the disten
sion of their joints and limbs.
Others were
bound face to face to pillars, not resting on their
feet, but with the weight of their bodies bearing
on their bonds and drawing them tightly.
And they endured this, not merely as long
as the governor talked with them or was at
leisure, but through almost the entire day.
For
when he passed on to others, he left officers
under his authority to watch the first, and ob

to the stripes.

stocks, being unable to keep themselves up on
account of the fresh wounds with which their
entire bodies were covered as a result of the
scourging.
Others were thrown on the ground
and lay there under the accumulated infliction
of tortures, exhibiting to the spectators a more
terrible manifestation of severity, as they bore
on their bodies the marks of the various and di
verse punishments which had been invented.
As this went on, some died under the tortures, shaming the adversary by their con
stancy. Others half dead were shut up in prison,
and suffering with their agonies, they died in
a few days; but the rest, recovering under the
care which they received, gained confidence by
time and their long detention in prison.
When therefore they were ordered to choose
whether they would be released from moles
tation by touching the polluted sacrifice, and
would receive from them the accursed freedom,
or refusing to sacrifice, should be condemned
to death, they did not hesitate, but went to
death cheerfully.
For they knew what had
been declared before by the Sacred Scriptures.
For it is said," "He that sacrificeth to other gods
shall be utterly destroyed,'' and, "Thou shalt
have no other gods before me.'"

Such are the words of the truly philosoph
ical and God-loving martyr, which, be
fore the final sentence, while yet in prison, he
addressed to the brethren in his parish, showing
them his own circumstances, and at the same
time exhorting them to hold fast, even after his
approaching death, to the religion of Christ.
But why need we dwell upon these things,
and continue to add fresh instances of the
conflicts of the divine martyrs throughout the
world, especially since they were dealt with no
longer by common law, but attacked like enemies
of war?

It would seem
that "four holes" constituted in ordinary cases the extreme limit.
But in two cases (Bk. V., chap. 1, § 27, and Mart. Pal. chap. 2) we
are told of a "fifth hole."
It is possible that the instruments
varied in respect to the number of the holes, for the way in which
the "four" is used here and elsewhere seems to indicate that the
extreme of torture is thought of.

Throwing fire into it, they consumed them with
the women and children while they were calling

This they did because all the in
habitants of the city, and the curator himself,
and the governor, with all who held office, and
the entire populace, confessed themselves Chris
tians, and would not in the least obey those who

commanded them to worship idols.

There was another man of Roman dig
nity named Adauctus," of a noble Italian
family, who had advanced through every honor
under the emperors, so that he had blamelessly
filled even the general offices of magistrate, as
they call it, and of finance minister."
Besides
all this he excelled in deeds of piety and in
the confession of the Christ of God, and was
adorned with the diadem of martyrdom. He
endured the conflict for religion while still hold
ing the office of finance minister.

It may have occurred
at that time, but I should myself have consideražđe hesitation in

If Eusebius' statement at the close of this paragraph could be relied
upon, we should be obliged to put the event after the issue of the
fourth edict, for not until that time were Christians in general called
upon to offer sacrifices.
But the statement may be merely a conclu
sion of Eusebius' own; and since he does not draw a clear distinction
between the various steps in the persecution, little weight can be laid
upon it.

Some, raised on high
by the feet, with their heads down, while a gen

by the smoke which arose from the burning wood,
as was done in Mesopotamia.
Others were
mutilated by cutting off their noses and ears
and hands, and cutting to pieces the other
members and parts of their bodies, as in
Alexandria." Why need we revive the recollection of those in Antioch who were roasted
on grates, not so as to kill them, but so as
to subject them to a lingering punishment? Or
of others who preferred to thrust their right
hand into the fire rather than touch the im
pious sacrifice?
Some, shrinking from the trial,
rather than be taken and fall into the hands
of their enemies, threw themselves from lofty

A certain holy person, - in soul admirable for virtue, in body a woman,-who
was illustrious beyond all in Antioch for wealth
and family and reputation, had brought up in
the principles of religion her two daughters,
who were now in the freshness and bloom of
life.
Since great envy was excited on their
account, every means was used to find them in
their concealment; and when it was ascertained
that they were away, they were summoned de
ceitfully to Antioch. Thus they were caught in
the nets of the soldiers. When the woman saw
herself and her daughters thus helpless, and
knew the things terrible to speak of that men
would do to them, - and the most unbearable
of all terrible things, the threatened violation
of their chastity,"-she exhorted herself and
the maidens that they ought not to submit even
to hear of this.
For, she said, that to surrender
their souls to the slavery of demons was worse
than all deaths and destruction; and she set
before them the only deliverance from all
these things, - escape to Christ. They then
listened to her advice. And after arranging
their garments suitably, they went aside from
the middle of the road, having requested of
the guards a little time for retirement, and
cast themselves into a river which was flowing

of deaths which the persecution was causing, and to have hit upon

and Palestine (see Mart. Pal. chap. 8 sq.).

In Pontus, others endured sufferings hor
Their fingers were pierced

Melted lead,
bubbling and boiling with the heat, was poured
down the backs of others, and they were

and privy members shameful and inhuman
and unmentionable torments, which the noble
and law-observing judges, to show their se
verity, devised, as more honorable manifes
tations of wisdom.
And new tortures were
continually invented, as if they were endeavor
ing, by surpassing one another, to gain
prizes in a contest.
But at the close of
these calamities, when finally they could
contrive no greater cruelties, and were weary
of putting to death, and were filled and satiated
with the shedding of blood, they turned to what
they considered merciful and humane treatment,
so that they seemed to be no longer devis
ing terrible things against us.
For they
said that it was not fitting that the cities
should be polluted with the blood of their own
people, or that the government of their rulers,
which was kind and mild toward all, should be
defamed through excessive cruelty; but that

a Eusebius evidently approved of these women's suicide, and it
must be confessed that they had great provocation. The views of
the early Church on the subject of suicide were in ordinary cases
very decided. They condemned it unhesitatingly as a crime, and
thus made a decided advance upon the position held b
many emi
ment Pagans of that age, especially among the Stoics.
In two cases,
however, their opinion of suicide was somewhat uncertain. There
existed in many quarters a feeling of admiration for those who vol
untarily rushed to martyrdom and needlessly sacrificed their lives.
The wiser and steadier minds, however, condemned this practice
unhesitatingly (cf. p. 8, above). . The second case in connection
with which the opinions of the Fathers were divided, was that which
meets us in the present passage. The majority of them evidently
not only justified but commended suicide in such an extremity.
The first Father distinctly to condemn the practice was Augustine
(De co, Dei. I. 22-27). He takes strong, ground on the subject,
and while admiring the bravery and ghastity of the many, famous
women that had rescued themselves by taking their own lives, he
denounces their act as sinful under all circumstances, maintaining
that suicide is never anything else than a crime against the law of
God.
The view of Augustine has very generally prevailed since his
time... Cf. Lecky's History of European Morals, 3d edition (Apple

For such things were humane in their
sight, and the lightest of punishments for us.
So that now on account of this kindly treat
ment accorded us by the impious, it was impos
sible to tell the incalculable number of those
whose right eyes had first been cut out with the
sword, and then had been cauterized with fire;
or who had been disabled in the left foot by
burning the joints, and afterward condemned to
the provincial copper mines, not so much for
service as for distress and hardship.

all these, others encountered other trials, which

these conflicts the noble martyrs of Christ
shone illustrious over the entire world, and
everywhere astonished those who beheld their
manliness; and the evidences of the truly divine
and unspeakable power of our Saviour were
made manifest through them.
To mention
each by name would be a long task, if not in

CHAPTER XIII.

The Bishops of the Church that evinced by their
Blood the Genuineness of the Religion which
they preached.

As for the rulers of the Church that suffered
martyrdom in the principal cities, the first
martyr of the kingdom of Christ whom we shall
mention among the monuments of the pious is
Anthimus,' bishop of the city of Nicomedia,
who was beheaded. Among the martyrs
at Antioch was Lucian," a presbyter of that
parish, whose entire life was most excellent.
At Nicomedia, in the presence of the emperor,
he proclaimed the heavenly kingdom of Christ,
first in an oral defense, and afterwards by
deeds as well. Of the martyrs in Phoenicia
the most distinguished were those devoted
pastors of the spiritual flocks of Christ: Tyran
nion," bishop of the church of Tyre; Zenobius,
a presbyter of the church at Sidon; and Sil
vanus," bishop of the churches about Emesa.

1 On Anthimus, see above, chap. 6, note 5.
* On Lucian of Antioch, see below, Bk. IX. chap. 6, note 4.
* Of Tyrannion and Zenobius, we know only what is told us here
All of the martyrs of whom Eusebius
and in the next paragraph.
tells us in this and the following books are commemorated in the
Martyrologies, and accounts of the passions of many of them are
given in various Acts, usually of doubtful authority.
I shall not
attempt to mention such documents in my notes, nor to give refer
ences to the Martyrologies, unless there be some special reason for
it in connection with a case of particular interest. Wherever we
have farther information in regard to any of these martyrs, in Euse
bius himself or other early Fathers, I shall endeavor to give the
needed references, passing other names by unnoticed. Tillemont
(H. E. V.) contains accounts of all these mon, and all the neces
sary references to the Martyrologies; the Bollandist Acts, etc. To
his work the curious reader is referred.

* Silvanus is mentioned again in Bk. IX. chap. 6, and from that
passage we learn that he was a very old man at the time of his
death, and that he had been bishop forty years.
It is, moreover,
directly stated in that passage that Silvanus suffered martyrdom at

received into the ranks of martyrs. The other
two glorified the word of God at Antioch through
patience unto death. The bishop" was thrown
into the depths of the sea.
But Zenobius, who
was a very skillful physician, died through severe
tortures which were applied to his sides.
Of the martyrs in Palestine, Silvanus,"bishop
of the churches about Gaza, was beheaded

and besides them many other distinguished per

the same period with Peter of Alexandria, namely, in the year 312
or thereabouts.
This being the date also of Lucian's martyrdom,
mentioned just above, we may assume it as probable that all men
tioned in this chapter suffered about the same time.

* i.e. Tyrannion.
* Silvanus, bishop of Gaza, is mentioned also in Mart. Pal.
chaps. 7 and 13. From the former chapter we learn that he became
a confessor at Ého in the fifth year of the persecution (A.D. 307),
while still a presbyter; from the latter, that he suffered martyrdom
in the seventh year, at the very close of the persecution in Pales
tine, and that he had been eminent in his confessions from the
beginning of the persecution.

7 Phaeno was a village of Arabia Petraea, between Petra and
Zoar, and contained celebrated copper mines, which were worked
by condemned criminals.

* Peleus and Nilus are mentioned in Mart. Pal. chap. 13, from
which passage we learn that they, like Silvanus, died in the seventh
rear of the persecution. An anonymous presbyter, and a man named
atermuthius, are named there as perishing with them in the flames.
* On Pamphilus, see above, Bk. VII. chap. 32, note 40. Euse

bius refers here to his Life of Pamphilus (see above, p. 28).

" On Peter of Alexandria, see above, Bk. VII. chap. 32, note 54.

At any rate, we learn from the latter chapter that the Faustus

mentioned there lived to a great age, and died in the persecution of
Diocletian, so that nothing stands in the way of identifying the two,
though in the absence of all positive testimony, the identification
cannot be insisted upon. Of Dius and Ammonius we know nothing.

been oustomary to identify this Hesychius with the reviser of the
text of the LXX and the Gospels which was widely current in Egypt
in the time of Jerome, and was known as the Hesychian recension
(see Jerome, Praes. in Paralifom., Apol. ad". Rus. II. 27, Praes.
in quattuor Ezrangesia , and cf. Comment. in Isaia on, LVIII. 11).
We know little about this text; but Jerome speaks of it slightingly,
as does also the Decretal of Gelasius, VI. § 15 (according to West
cott's Hist. of the Canon, 5th ed., p. 392, note 5). The identifica
tion of the two men is quite possible, for the recension referred to
belonged no doubt to this period; but no positive arguments beyond
agreement in name and country can be urged in support of it.
Fabricius proposed to identify our Hesychius with the author of the
famous Greek Lexicon, ...'. is still extant.
But this identification
is now commonly rejected; and the author of the lexicon is regarded
as a pagan, who lived in Alexandria during the latter part of the
fourth century.

But in the present book" I will
add to what I have given the revocation

which will be most profitable to such as shall

What words could sufficiently describe the
greatness and abundance of the prosperity
of the Roman government before the war against
us, while the rulers were friendly and peaceable
toward us?
Then those who were highest in
the government, and had held the position ten
or twenty years, passed their time in tranquil
peace, in festivals and public games and
most joyful pleasures and cheer.
While
thus their authority was growing uninter
ruptedly, and increasing day by day, suddenly
they changed their peaceful attitude toward us,
and began an implacable war.
But the second
year of this movement was not yet past, when a

the eighth book of his History, for he uses A6-yos frequently in re
ferring to the separate books of his work, but nowhere else, so far as
I am aware, in referring to the work as a whole. This would seem
to indicate that he was thinking at this time of writing only eight
books, and of bringing his History to an end with the toleration edict
of Galerius, which he gives in chap. 17, below. Might it be sup
posed that the present passage was written immediately after the
publication of the edict of Galerius, and before the renewal of the
persecution by Maximin? If that were so, we might assume that
after the close of that persecution, in consequence of the victory of
Constantine and Licinius, the historian felt it necessary to add yet a
ninth book to his work, not contemplated at the time he was writing
his eighth; as he seems still later, after the victory of Constantine
over Licinius, to have found it necessary to add a tenth book, in
order that his work might cover the entire period of persecution and
include the final triumph of the Church.
His motive, indeed, in
adding the tenth book seems not to have been to bring the history
down to the latest date possible, for he made no additions during his
later years, in spite of the interesting and exciting events which took
place after 325 A.D., but to bring it down to the final triumph of the
Church over her pagan enemies. Had there been another persecu
tion and another toleration edict between 325 and 338, we can hardly
doubt that Eusebius would have added an account of it to his His
tory.
In view of these considerations, it is possible that some time
may have elapsed between the composition of the eighth and ninth
books, as ji'. between the composition of the ninth and tenth.
It must be admitted, however, that a serious objection to this
o lies in the fact that in chaps. 15 and 16, below, the
tenth year of the persecution is spoken of, and in the latter chapter
the author is undoubtedly thinking of the Edict of Milan, which was
issued in 312, after the renewal of Maximin's persecution described
in Book so I am, nevertheless, inclined to think that Eusebius,

with the present book, and that the necessity for another book made

the words in chaps. 15 and 16 are a later insertion.
I do not regard
this as probable, but knowing the changes that were made in the
ninth book in a second edition of the History, it must be admitted
that such changes in the eighth book are not impossible (see above,
p. 30 and 45). At the same time I prefer the former alternative,
that the necessity for another book became manifest before he fin
ished the present one. A slight confirmation of the theory that the
ninth book was a later addition, necessitated by the persecution of
Maximin's later years, may be found in the appendix to the eighth
book which is found in many MSS. See below, p. 310, note 1.

less, than two years after the publication of Diocletian's First Edict.
The causes of the abdication have been given variously by different
writers, and our original authorities are themselves in no better
agreement.
I do not propose to enter here into a discussion of the
subject, but am convinced that Burckhardt, Mason, and others are
correct in looking upon the abdication, not as the result of a sudden
resolve, but as a part of Diocletian's great plan, and as such long
resolved upon and regarded as one of the fundamental requirements
of his system to be regularly observed by his successors, as well as
by himself. The abdication of Diocletian and Maximian raised the
Caesars Constantius and Galerius to the rank of Augusti, and two
new Caesars, Maximinus Daza in the East, and Severus in the West,
were appointed to succeed them.
Diocletian himself retired to
Dalmatia, his native province, where he passed the remainder of his
life in rural pursuits, until his death in 313.
17 Eusebius is correct in saying that to empire had never been
divided up to this time.
For it had always been ruled as one whole,
even when the imperial power was shared by two or more princes.
And even the system of Diocletian was not meant to divide the
empire into two or more independent parts. The plan was simply
to west the supreme power in two heads, who should be given lieu
tenants to assist them in the government, but who should jointly
represent the unity of the whole while severally administering their
respective territories.
Imperial acts to be valid had to be joint, not
individual acts, and had to bear the name of both Augusti, while the
Caesars were looked upon only as the lieutenants and representatives
of their respective superiors.
Finally, in the last analysis, there was
...i. but the one supreme head, the first Augustus. While
Diocletian was emperor, the theoretical unity was a practical thing.
long as his strong hand was on the helm, Maximian, the other
Augustus, did not venture to do anything in opposition to his wishes,
and thus the great system worked smoothly. É. with Diocletian's
abdication, everything was changed. Theoretically Constantius was
the first Augustus, but Galerius, not Constantius, had had the nam
ing of the Caesars; and there was no intention on Galerius' part to
acknowledge in any way his inferiority to Constantius.
In fact, being
in the East, whence the government had been carried on for
twenty years, it was natural that he should be entirely independent
of Constantius, and that thus, as Eusebius says, a genuine division
of the empire, not theoretical but practical, should be the result.
The principle remained the same; but West and East seemed now
to stand, not under one great emperor, but under two equal and
independent heads.

13 Constantius Chlorus died at York, in Britain, July 25, 306.
According to the system of Diocletian, the Caesar Severus should
regularly have succeeded to his place, and a new Caesar should have

was at once proclaimed his successor, and hailed as Augustus by the
army. This was by no means to Galerius' taste, for he had far
other plans in mind; but he was not in a position to dispute Con
stantine's claims, and so made the best of the situation by recogniz
ing Constantine not as Augustus, but as second Cesar, while he
raised Severus to the rank of Augustus, and made his own Caesar
Maximin first Caesar.
Constantine was thus theoretically subject to
Severus, but the subjection was only a fiction, for he was practically
independent in his own district from that time on.
Our sources are unanimous in giving Constantius an amiable and
Fo character, unusually free from bigotry and cruelty. ... Although
e was obliged to show some respect to the persecuting edicts of his
superiors, Diocletian and Maximian, he seems to have been averse
to persecution, and to have gone no further than was necessary in
that direction, destroying some churches, but apparently subjecting
none of the Christians to bodily injury. We have no hint, however,
that he was a Christian, or that his generous treatment of the Chris
tians was the result in any way of a belief in their religion.
It was
simply the result of his natural tolerance and humanity, combined,

the first that was ranked by them among the
gods, and received after death every honor which
one could pay to an emperor." He was
the kindest and mildest of emperors, and
the only one of those of our day that passed
all the time of his government in a manner
worthy of his office.
Moreover, he conducted
himself toward all most favorably and benefi
cently. He took not the smallest part in the
war against us, but preserved the pious that were
under him unharmed and unabused. He neither
threw down the church buildings," nor did he
devise anything else against us. The end of his
life was honorable and thrice blessed. He alone
at death left his empire happily and gloriously
to his own son as his successor, - one who was
in all respects most prudent and pious.
His son Constantine entered on the govern
ment at once, being proclaimed supreme
emperor and Augustus by the soldiers, and long
before by God himself, the King of all. He
showed himself an emulator of his father's piety
toward our doctrine.

Such an one was he.

But after this, Licinius was declared emperor

and Augustus by a common vote of the
rulers."
These things grieved Maximinus
greatly, for until that time he had been
entitled by all only Caesar. He therefore, being
exceedingly imperious, seized the dignity for
himself, and became Augustus, being made such

doubtless, with a conviction, that there was nothing essentially
vicious or dangerous in Christianity.

19 Not the first of Roman emperors to be so honored, but the
first of the four rulers who were at that time at the head of the
empire. It had been the custom from the beginning to degree
divine honors to the Roman emperors upon their decease, unless
their characters or their reigns had been such as to leave universal
hatred behind them, in which case such honors were often denied
them, and their memory publicly and officially execrated, and all
their public monuments destroyed. The ascription of such honors
to Constantius, therefore, does not in itself imply that he was supe
rior to the other three rulers, nor indeed superior to the emperors in
general, but only that he was not a monster, as some had been. The
last emperor to receive such divine honors was Diocletian himself,
with whose death the old pagan régime came finally to an end.

* This is a mistake; for though Constantius seems to have pro
ceeded as mildly as possible, he did destroy churches, as we are
o informed by Lactantius (de Mort. Aers. 15), and as we can
learn from extant Acts and other, sources (see Mason, p. 146 sq.).
Eusebius, perhaps, knew nothing about the matter, and simply drew
a conclusion from the known character of Constantius and his gen
eral tolerance toward the Christians.

omitted by Eusebius. , Maxentius, son of the old Augustus Max

MAXENTIUS his son, who obtained the gov

Galerius of the fact. The latter could not afford to quarrel with Max
iminus, and therefore bestowed upon him the full dignity of an Augus

four independent Augusti (to say nothing of the emperor Maxen
tius), and the system of Diocletian was a thing of the past.

* The reference is to the Augustus Maximian. After his abdi
cation he retired to Lucania, but in the following year was induced
by his son, Maxentius, to leave his retirement, and join him in
wresting lo, and Africa from Severus.
It was due in large meas
ure to his military skill and to the prestige of his name that Severus
was vanquished and Galerius repulsed. After his victories Maximian
went to Gaul, to see Constantine and form an alliance with him.
He bestowed upon him the title of Augustus and the hand of his
daughter Fausta, and endeavored to induce him to join him in a

do; and Maximian finally returned to Rome, where he found his
son Maxentius entrenched in the affections of the soldiers and the
people, and bent upon ruling for himself.
After a bitter quarrel
with him, in which he attempted, but failed, to wrest the purple
from him, he left the city, attended the congress of Carnuntum,
and acquiesced in the appointment of Licinius as second, Augus
tus, which of course involved, the formal renunciation of his own
claims and those of his son. He then betook himself again to Con
stantine, but during the latter's temporary absence treacherously
had himself proclaimed Augustus by some of the troops. He was,
however, easily overpowered by Constantine, but was forgiven and
ranted his liberty again. About two years later, unable to resist
the desire to reign, he made an attempt upon Constantine's life with
the hope of once more securing the power for himself, but was de
tected and allowed to choose the manner of his own death, and in
February, 31o, strangled himself. The general facts just stated are
well made out, but there is some uncertainty as to the exact order of
events, in regard to which our sources are at variance. Compare
especially the works of Hunziker, Burckhardt, and Mason, and the
respective articles in Smith's Pict. of Greek and Roman Biog.

usebius' memory plays him false in this passage; for he has not
mentioned, as he states, Maximian's resumption of the imperial dig
mity after his abdication. A few important MSS., followed by Hein
ichen, omit the entire clause, "whom we have mentioned as having

in the majority of the MSS. and in Rufinus, and are accepted by all
the other editors.
There can, in fact, be no doubt that Eusebius
wrote the words, and that the omission of them in some codices is
due to the fact that some scribe or scribes perceived his slip, and
consequently omitted the clause.

* Valesius understands by this (as in § 12, above), the first of
the four emperors. . But we find in Lactantius (of. chap. 42) the
distinct statement that Diocletian (whose statues were thrown down
in Rome with those of Maximian, to which they were joined, Janus
fashion) was the first emperor that had ever suffered such an indig
nity, and there is no hint in the text that Eusebius means any less
than that in making his statement, though we know that it is incor
rect.

* See the previous chapter, note 21.
The character which Eusebius gives to Maxentius in this chapter
is borne out by all our sources, both heathen and Christian, and
seems not to be greatly overdrawn.
It has been sometimes dis
puted whether he persecuted the Christians, but there is no ground
to suppose that he did, though they, in common with all his sub
jects, had to suffer from his oppression, and therefore hated him as
deeply as the others did.

was doubtless in part due to hostility to Galerius, but chiefly to
political considerations. He apparently saw what Constantine later
saw and profited by, - that it would be for his profit, and would
tend to strengthen his government, to gain the friendship of that
large body of his subjects which had been so violently handled
under the reign of his father. And, no doubt, the universal tolera
tion which he offered was one of the great sources of his strength at
the beginning of his reign. Upon his final defeat by Constantine,

in complaisance and flattery toward the Roman
people. On this account he commanded his
Christians,
subjects to cease persecuting the
pretending to religion that he might appear
merciful and mild beyond his predeces
sors.
But he did not prove in his deeds
to be such a person as was hoped, but ran
into all wickedness and abstained from no im
purity or licentiousness, committing adulteries and
indulging in all kinds of corruption. For having
separated wives from their lawful consorts, he
abused them and sent them back most dishonor
ably to their husbands. And he not only prac
ticed this against the obscure and unknown, but
he insulted especially the most prominent and
distinguished members of the Roman sen
ate.
All his subjects, people and rulers,
honored and obscure, were worn out by
grievous oppression.
Neither, although they
kept quiet, and bore the bitter servitude, was
there any relief from the murderous cruelty of
the tyrant.
Once, on a small pretense, he gave
the people to be slaughtered by his guards; and a
great multitude of the Roman populace were slain
in the midst of the city, with the spears and
arms, not of Scythians and barbarians, but
of their own fellow-citizens.
It would be
impossible to recount the number of sena
tors who were put to death for the sake of their
wealth; multitudes being slain on various
pretenses. To crown all his wickedness,
the tyrant resorted to magic. And in his
divinations he cut open pregnant women, and
again inspected the bowels of newborn in
fants.
He slaughtered lions, and performed

Maximinus Daza was a nephew of Galerius, who owed his ad
vancement, not to his own merits, but solely to the favor of his
uncle, but who, nevertheless, after acquiring power, was by no
means the tool Galerius had expected him to be.
Eusebius seems
not to have exaggerated his wickedness in the least. He was the
most abandoned and vicious of the numerous rulers of the time, and
was utterly without redeeming qualities, so far as we can ascertain.

his colleagues, and even after the toleration edict and death of Gale

Therefore he perse

his predecessors.
He ordered temples to be
erected in every city, and the sacred groves which
had been destroyed through lapse of time to be
speedily restored. He appointed idol priests in
every place and city; and he set over them in
every province, as high priest, some political
official who had especially distinguished himself
in every kind of service, giving him a band of
soldiers and a body-guard. And to all jugglers,
as if they were pious and beloved of the gods,
he granted governments and the greatest
privileges.
From this time on he distressed
and harassed, not one city or country, but
all the provinces under his authority, by ex
treme exactions of gold and silver and goods, and
most grievous prosecutions and various fines. He
took away from the wealthy the property which
they had inherited from their ancestors, and
bestowed vast riches and large sums of
money on the flatterers about him. And
he went to such an excess of folly and
drunkenness that his mind was deranged and
crazed in his carousals; and he gave com
mands when intoxicated of which he repented
afterward when sober. He suffered no one to
surpass him in debauchery and profligacy, but
made himself an instructor in wickedness to
those about him, both rulers and subjects. He
urged on the army to live wantonly in every kind
of revelry and intemperance, and encouraged
the governors and generals to abuse their sub

as if they were rulers with him.

In all they showed patience
in behalf of religion rather than transfer to
idols the reverence due to God. And the
women were not less manly than the men
in behalf of the teaching of the Divine Word,
as they endured conflicts with the men, and
bore away equal prizes of virtue. And when
they were dragged away for corrupt purposes,
they surrendered their lives to death rather than
their bodies to impurity."

but although she was ready to die, he could not
put her to death, for his desire was stronger
than his anger. He therefore punished her
with exile, and took away all her property.
Many others, unable even to listen to the threats
of violation from the heathen rulers, endured
every form of tortures, and rackings, and deadly
punishment.

These indeed should be admired.

But far
the most admirable was that woman at Rome,
who was truly the most noble and modest of
all, whom the tyrant Maxentius, fully resembling
Maximinus in his actions, endeavored to
abuse.
For when she learned that those
who served the tyrant in such matters were
at the house (she also was a Christian), and that
her husband, although a prefect of Rome, would
suffer them to take and lead her away, having
requested a little time for adorning her body,

for her. And by her deeds, more powerfully
than by any words, she has shown to all men
now and hereafter that the virtue which prevails
among Christians is the only invincible and in
destructible possession."

Such was the career of wickedness which
was carried forward at one and the same
time by the two tyrants who held the East and
the West. Who is there that would hesitate, after
careful examination, to pronounce the persecu
tion against us the cause of such evils? Especially
since this extreme confusion of affairs did not
cease until the Christians had obtained liberty.

* Diocletian's First Edict was issued on Feb. 24, 303; and the
persecution was brought to a final end by Constantine and Licinius'
edict of toleration, which was issued at Milan late in the year 312
(see below,
X. chap. 9, note 17). The persecution may there
fore be said to have lasted altogether ten years; although of course
there were many cessations during that period, and in the West it
really came to an end with the usurpation of Maxentius in 306,
and in the East (except in Maximin's dominions) with the edict of
Galerius in 31 1.

* This passage is largely rhetorical.

It is true that enough plot
ting and warring went on after the usurpation of Maxentius in 396,
and after the death of Galerius in 311, to justify pretty strong state
ments.
Gibbon, for instance, says: "The abdication of Diocletian
and Maximian was succeeded by eighteen years of discord and con
fusion. The empire was afflicted by five civil wars; and the re
mainder of the time was not so much a state of tranquillity as a
suspension of arms between several hostile monarchs, who, viewing
each other with an eye of fear and hatred, strove to increase their
respective forces at the expense of their subjects" (chap. xiv.). At
the same time, during the four years between 307 and 311, though
there was not the harmony ... had existed under Diocletian, and
though the interests of the West and East were in the main hostile,
yet the empire was practically at peace, barring the persecution of
the Christians.

-

* See below, Bk. IX. chap. 8.
* The edict of Milan, issued by Constantine and Licinius toward
the close of the year 312 (upon the date, see Mason, p. 333, note)
put an end to the persecution in its tenth year, though complete tol.
eration was not proclaimed by Maximin until the following spring.
Very soon aster the close of the eighth year, in April, 311, Galerius
issued his edict of toleration, which is given in the next chapter. . It
is, therefore, to the publication of this edict that Eusebius refers
when he says that the persecution had begun to decrease after the
eighth year.
Maximin yielded reluctant and partial consent to
this edict for a few months, but before the end of the year he began
to persecute again; and during the year 312 the Christians suffered
severely in his dominions (see Bk. IX. chap. 2 sq.).

human agency; nor was it the result, as one
might say, of the compassion or philanthropy of
our rulers; -far from it, for daily from the be
ginning until that time they were devising more
and more severe measures against us, and con
tinually inventing outrages by a greater variety
of instruments; - but it was manifestly due to
the oversight of Divine Providence, on the one
hand becoming reconciled to his people, and on
the other, attacking him " who instigated these
evils, and showing anger toward him as the au
thor of the cruelties of the entire persecu
tion.
For though it was necessary that
these things should take place, according
to the divine judgment, yet the Word saith,

"Woe to him through whom the

Therefore punishment from God
came upon him, beginning with his flesh,
and proceeding to his soul."
For an abscess suddenly appeared in the midst of the
secret parts of his body, and from it a deeply
perforated sore, which spread irresistibly into
his inmost bowels. An indescribable multitude
of worms sprang from them, and a deathly odor
arose, as the entire bulk of his body had, through
his gluttony, been changed, before his sick
ness, into an excessive mass of soft fat, which
became putrid, and thus presented an awful
and intolerable sight to those who came
near. Some of the physicians, being wholly
unable to endure the exceeding offensive
ness of the odor, were slain ; others, as the en
tire mass had swollen and passed beyond hope
of restoration, and they were unable to render
any help, were put to death without mercy.

* The plural here seems a little peculiar, for the edict was issued
only in the name of Galerius, Constantine, and Licinius, not in the
name of Maximin. We have no record of Licinius as a persecu
tor before this time, and Eusebius' words of praise in the ninth book
would seem to imply that he had not shown himself at all hostile to
the Church. And in fact Licinius seems ruled out by § 2, below, where
" they " are spoken of as having "from the beginning devised more
and more severe measures against us." And yet, since Constantine
did not persecute, we must suppose either that Licinius is included
in Eusebius' plural, or what is perhaps more probable, that Eusebius
thinks of the edict as proceeding from all sour emperors though
bearing the names of only three of them.
It is true that the latter is
rather a violent supposition in view of Eusebius' own words in the
first chapter of Bk. IX.
I confess that I find no satisfactory ex
planation of the apparent inconsistency.

* Galerius seems to have been smitten with the terrible disease,
which Eusebius here refers to, and which is described by Lactantius
at considerable length (De mort. Aers, chap. 33) and with many

GALERIUS EDICT OF TOLERATION.

CHAPTER XVII.

The Revocation of the Rulers.

WRESTLING with so many evils, he thought
of the cruelties which he had committed
against the pious. Turning, therefore, his thoughts
toward himself, he first openly confessed to the
God of the universe, and then summoning his
attendants, he commanded that without delay
they should stop the persecution of the Chris
tians, and should by law and royal decree, urge
them forward to build their churches and to
perform their customary worship, offering prayers
in behalf of the emperor.
Immediately the
deed followed the word. The imperial de
crees were published in the cities, contain
ing the revocation of the acts against us in the

following form :

Maximinus, Invictus,

"The Emperor Caesar Galerius Valerius

* This edict was issued in April, 311 (see the previous chapter,
note 1). There has been considerable discussion as to the reason
for the omission of Maximin's name from the heading of the edict.
The simplest explanation is that he did not wish to have his name
appear in a document which was utterly distasteful to him and which
he never fully sanctioned, as we learn from Bk. IX. chaps. 1 and 2,
below. . It is possible, as Mason suggests, that in the copies of the
edict which were designed for other parts of the empire than his
own the names of .# four emperors appeared. Eusebius gives a
Greek translation of the edict. The original Latin is found in Lac
tantius' De mort. Aers. chap. 34. The translation in the present
case is in the main accurate though somewhat free. The edict is
an acknowledgment of defeat on Galerius' part, and was undoubt
edly caused in large part by a superstitious desire, brought on by his
sickness, to propitiate the ë. of the Christians whom o had been
unable to conquer.
And yet, in my opinion, it is not as Mason calls
it, "one of the most bizarre state documents ever penned," "couched
in language treacherous, contradictory, and sown with the most viru
lent hatred"; neither does it "lay the blame upon the Christians
because o had forsaken Christ," nor aim to "dupe and outwit
the angry Christ, by pretending to be not a persecutor, but a re
former." As will be seen from note 3, below, I interpret the docu
ment in quite another way, and regard it as a not inconsistent
statement of the whole matter from Galerius' own point of view.

conformity with the ancient laws and public dis
cipline" of the Romans, and to provide that the
Christians also, who have forsaken the religion
of their ancestors," should return to a good
* Tilv čnuoqiav Šmariumv. Latin: publicam disciplina.m.
* row yovéow rior èavrov riv aipeouv. Latin: parentum su
orum sectamt.
There has been some discussion as to whether
Galerius here refers to primitive Christianity or to paganism, but the
almost unanimous opinion of scholars (so far as I am aware) is that
he means the former (cf. among others, Mason, p. 298 sq.).
I con
sess myself, however, unable, after careful study of the document, to
accept this interpretation. Not that I think it impossible that Gale
rius should pretend that the cause of the persecution had been the
departure P. Christians from primitive Christianity, and its ob
ject the reform of the Church, because, although that was certainly
not his object, he may nevertheless, when conquered, have wished
to make it appear so to the Christians at least (see Mason, p. 302 sq.).
My reason for not accepting the interpretation is that I cannot see
that the language of the edict warrants it; and certainly, inasmuch
as it is not what we should a £riori expect Galerius to say, we are
hardly justified in adopting it except upon very clear grounds.
But in my opinion such grounds do not exist, and in fact the inter
o seems to me to do violence to at least a part of the decree.
n the present sentence it is certainly not necessarily implied that
the ancestors of the Christians held a different religion from the an
cestors of the heathen; in fact, it seems on the face of it more natural
to suppose that Galerius is referring to the earlier ancestors of both
Christians and heathen, who were alike pagans. This is confirmed
by the last clause of the sentence: ad homas mentes redirent (eis
dyabov opó6eguy navéA6owev), which in the mouth of Galerius, and
indeed of any heathen, would naturally mean "return to the worship
of our gods." . This in itself, however, proves nothing, for Galerius
may, as is claimed, have used the words hypocritically; but in the
next sentence, which is looked upon as the main support of the in
terpretation which I am combating, it is not said that they have
deserted their ancient institutions in distinction from the institu
tions of the rest of the world, but illa zeterum instituta (a term
which he could hardly employ in this unqualified way to indicate the
originators of Christianity without gross and gratuitous insult to his
heathen subjects) quae for sitan Arimum parentes eorum dem con
stituerant, "those institutions of the ancients which perchance
their own fathers had first established" (the Greek is not quite accu
rate, omitting the demonstrative, and reading mpérepov for pri
mum). There can hardly have been a "perchance" about the fact
that the Christians' ancestors had first established Christian institu
tions, whatever they were - certainly Galerius would never have
thought of implying that his ancestors, or the ancestors of his brother
#. had established them.
His aim seems to be to suggest, as
ood for reflection, not only that the ancestors of the Christians had
certainly, with the ancestors of the heathen, originally observed
pagan institutions, but that perhaps they had themselves been the
very ones to establish those institutions, which would make the guilt
of the Christians in departing from them all the worse.
In the
next clause, the reference to the Christians as making laws for
themselves and assembling in various places may as easily be a
rebuke to the Christians for their separation from their heathen
sellow-citizens in matters of life and worship as a rebuke to them
for their departure from the original unity of the Christian Church.
Again, in the next sentence the "institutions of the ancients" (ve
teru mt instituta) are referred to in the most general way, without
any such qualification as could possibly lead (i. Christians or any
one else to think that the institutions ...? . Christian religion were
meant. Conformity to "the ancient laws and public discipline of
the Romans" is announced in the beginning of the edict as the

. of propitiating his Christian subjects, that those laws and that
discipline were Christian? Peterum instituta in fact could mean
to the reader nothing else, as thus absolutely used, than the institu
tions of the old Romans.

.

Still further it is to be noticed that in § 9 Galerius does not say
"but although many perseyere in their purpose .
. nevertheless,
in consideration of our philanthropy, we have determined that we
ought to extend our indulgence," &c., but rather "...and since (at
que cum) many persevere in their purpose," &c. The significance

mean to say . he feels that he ought to extend indulgence just
because they do exactly what they did before - worship neither the
gods of the heathen nor the God of the Christians? I can hardly
think so. He seems to me to say rather, "Since many, in spite of
my severe measures, still persevere in their purpose (in proposito
Aersevera rent) and refuse to worship our gods, while at the same
time they cease under the pressure to worship their own God as
they have been accustomed to do, I have decided to permit them to
return to their own worship, thinking it better that they worship the
God of the Christians than that they worship no God; provided in
worshiping him they do nothing contrary to discipline (contra
disciplina m), i.e. contrary to Roman law." Thus interpreted, the
entire edict seems to me consistent and at the same time perfectly
natural.
It is intended to propitiate the Christians and to have them
ray for the good of the emperor to their own God, rather than re
use to pray for him altogether;
It is not an acknowledgment even
to the Christians that their God is the supreme and only true God,
but it is an acknowledgment that their God is probably better than

disposition.
For in some way such arro
gance had seized them and such stupidity
had overtaken them, that they did not follow
the ancient institutions which possibly their own
ancestors had formerly established, but made
for themselves laws according to their own pur
pose, as each one desired, and observed them,
and thus assembled as separate congrega
tions in various places. When we had issued
this decree that they should return to the
institutions established by the ancients," a great
many" submitted under danger, but a great many
being harassed endured all kinds of death."
And since many continue in the same folly,
and we perceive that they neither offer to
the heavenly gods the worship which is due, nor
pay regard to the God of the Christians, in con
sideration of our philanthropy and our invariable
custom, by which we are wont to extend pardon
to all, we have determined that we ought most
cheerfully to extend our indulgence in this matter
also ; that they may again be Christians, and may
rebuild the conventicles in which they were ac
customed to assemble," on condition that nothing

and that they may live securely in their several

no god, and that the empire will be better off if they become loyal,
peaceable, prayerful citizens again (even if their prayers are not
directed to the highest gods), than if they continue disaffected and
disloyal and serve and worship no superior being. That the edict
becomes, when thus interpreted, much more dignified and much
more worthy of an emperor cannot be denied; and, little respect as
we may have for Galerius, we should not accuse him of playing the
hypocrite and the fool in this matter, except on better grounds than
are offered by the extant text of this edict.

• contra disciplinam, i.e. "against the discipline or laws of the
Romans." Galerius does not tell us just what this indefinite phrase
is meant to cover, and the letter to the magistrates, in which he
doubtless explained himself and laid down the conditions, is unfortu
nately lost. The edict of Milan, as Mason conclusively shows,
refers to this edict of Galerius and to these accompanying condi
tions; and from that edict some light is thrown upon the nature of
these conditions imposed by Galerius. . It has been conjectured that
in Galerius' edict, Christianity was forbidden to all but certain
classes: "that is a man chose to declare himself a Christian, he
would incur no danger, but might no longer take his seat as a decu
rion in his native town, or the like"; that Galerius had endeavored
to make money out of the transaction whereby Christians received
their church property back again; that proselytizing was forbidden;
that possibly the toleration of Christianity was made a matter of
local option, and that any town or district by a majority vote could
rchibit its exercise within its own limits (see Mason, p. 330 sq.).
These conjectures are plausible, though of course precarious.

THE author of the edict very shortly after
this confession was released from his pains
and died. He is reported to have been the
original author of the misery of the persecution,
having endeavored, long before the movement
of the other emperors, to turn from the faith the
Christians in the army, and first of all those in
his own house, degrading some from the military
rank, and abusing others most shamefully, and
threatening still others with death, and finally
inciting his partners in the empire to the gen
eral persecution.
It is not proper to pass over
the death of these emperors in silence.
As four of them held the supreme authority, those who were advanced in age and
persecution had continued
honor, after
not quite two years, abdicated the govern
ment, as we have already stated," and passed
the remainder of their lives in a common
and private station. The end of their lives
was as follows. He who was first in honor
and age perished through a long and most griev

substituted it for Tpon ov, and have rendered accordingly.
Cruse has done likewise, whether for the same reason Yao not know.
11 Eusebius does not say whether the translating was done by
himself or by some one else. The epistle of Hadrian to Minucius
Fundanus, quoted in Bk. IV. chap. 9, above, was translated by him
self, as he directly informs us (see total. chap. 8, note 17). This
might lead us to suppose him the translator in the present case; but,
on the other hand, in that case he directly says that the translation
was his work, in the present he does not. It is possible that Greek
copies of the edict were in common circulation, and that Eusebius
used one of them. At the same time, the words "translated as well
as possible" (kara to Suvarov) would seem to indicate that Eusebius
had supervised the present translation, if he had not made it himself.
Upon his knowledge of Latin, see the note just referred to.

as late as 313, for Diocletian died in that year.

him by Maximin, Licinius, and Constantine, wore him out and at
length drove the spirit from the shattered body. According to Lactan

a translation of it is given both by Christophorsonus and Walesius.
The Germans Stroth and Closs omit it; but Stigloher gives it at the
close of his translation of the History. The English translators
insert it at the close of the eighth book. The work is undoubtedly
genuine, in this, its shorter, as well as in its longer form, but was
in all probability attached to the History, not by Eusebius himself,
but by some copyist, and therefore is not strictly entitled to a place
in a translation of the History. At the same time it has seemed
best in the present case to include it and to follow the majority of the
editors in inserting it at this point. . In all the MSS. except one the

Heinichen consequently
prints the first part of this title (Evoebiou ..... uaprupna artwov) at
the head of the work in his edition, and is followed by Burton and

work is much more systematic than the eighth book of the Church
A/istory, in fact, it is excellently arranged, and takes up the perse

however, is very limited, and we can consequently gather from the

Such was the force of the first edict against
us.
But not long after other letters were issued,
commanding that all the bishops of the churches
everywhere be first thrown into prison, and after
ward, by every artifice, be compelled to sacrifice.

CHAPTER I.

THE first of the martyrs of Palestine was
Procopius," who, before he had received the
trial of imprisonment, immediately on his first
appearance before the governor's tribunal, having
been ordered to sacrifice to the so-called gods,
declared that he knew only one to whom it was
proper to sacrifice, as he himself wills.
But
when he was commanded to offer libations to
the four emperors, having quoted a sentence
which displeased them, he was immediately be
headed. The quotation was from the poet:

* The account of Procopius was somewhat fuller in the longer
recension of the J/artyrs of Palestine, as can be seen srom the
Syriac version (English translation in Cureton, p. 3 sq.). There
exists also a Latin translation of the Acts of St. Procopius, which
was evidently made from that longer recension, and which is printed
by Walesius and also by Cureton (p. 50 sq.), and in English by
Cruse in loco. We are told by the Syriac version that his family
was from Baishan. According to the Latin, he was a native of
AElia (Jerusalem), but resided in Scythopolis (the Greek name of
Baishan). With the Latin agrees the Syriac version of these Acts,
which is published by Assemani in his Acta SS. Martt. Orient, et
Occident. ed. 1748, Part II. p. 169 sq. (see Cureton, p. 52). We
learn from the longer account that he was a lector, interpreter, and
exorcist in the church, and that he was exceedingly ascetic in his
manner of life.
It is clear from this paragraph that Procopius was
put to death, not because he was a Christian, but because he uttered
words apparently treasonable in their import. To call him a Chris
tian martvr is therefore a misuse of terms. We cannot be sure
whether Procopius was arrested under the terms of the first or under
the terms of the second edict.
If in consequence of the first, it may
be that he was suspected of complicity in the plot which Diocletian
was endeavoring to crush out, or that he had interfered with the im
perial officers, when they undertook to execute the decree for the
destruction of the church buildings. The fact that he was com
manded by the governor to sacrifice would lead us to think of the
first, rather than of the second edict (see above, Bk. VIII. chap. 6,
Still, it must be admitted that very
note 3, and chap. 2, note 8).
likely many irregularities occurred in the methods by which the de
crees were executed in the province, and the command to sacrifice
can, therefore, not be claimed as proving that he was not arrested
under the terms of the second edict; and in fact, the mention of
imprisonment as the punishment which he had to expect would lead
us to think of the second edict as at least the immediate occasion of
his arrest.
In any case, there is no reason to suppose that his ar
rest would have resulted in his death had he not been rash in his

| speech.

an example of noble conflicts.
But others, be
numbed in spirit by terror, were easily weakened
at the first onset. Of the rest, each one endured
different forms of torture, as scourgings without
number, and rackings, and tearings of their
sides, and insupportable fetters, by which
the hands of some were dislocated.
Yet
they endured what came upon them, as in
accordance with the inscrutable purposes of
God.
For the hands of one were seized, and
he was led to the altar, while they thrust into
his right hand the polluted and abominable offer
ing, and he was dismissed as if he had sacri
ficed.
Another had not even touched it, yet
when others said that he had sacrificed, he went
away in silence.
Another, being taken up half
dead, was cast aside as if already dead, and
released from his bonds, and counted among
the sacrificers. When another cried out, and
testified that he would not obey, he was struck
in the mouth, and silenced by a large band of
those who were drawn up for this purpose, and
driven away by force, even though he had not

Eusebius refers in such general terms in this and the following para

In fact, from the Syriac
version of the longer recension (Cureton, p. 4) we learn that the
tortures inflicted upon Alphaeus and Zacchaeus were, in consequence
of the third edict, issued at the approach of the emperor's vicennalia,
and intended rather as a step toward amnesty than as a sharpening
of the persecution (see above, Bk. VIII. chap. 2, note, 8). This
leads us to conclude that all the tortures mentioned in these para
graphs had the same occasion, and thiso the eagerness of the
judges to set the prisoners free, even if they had not sacrificed, so
long as they might be made to appear to have done so, and thus the
law not be § violated. Alphaeus and Zacchaeus alone suffered
death, as we are told in § 5, and they evidently on purely political
grounds (see note io).

the Kalends of December, - having confessed
one only God and Christ Jesus as king," as
if they had uttered some blasphemy, they were
beheaded like the former martyr.

CHAPTER II.

WHAT occurred to Romanus on the same
day' at Antioch, is also worthy of record.
For he was a native of Palestine, a deacon and
exorcist in the parish of Caesarea; and being
present at the destruction of the churches, he
beheld many men, with women and children, going
up in crowds to the idols and sacrificing."
But,
through his great zeal for religion, he could not
endure the sight, and rebuked them with
a loud voice.
Being arrested for his boldness, he proved a most noble witness of the
truth, if there ever was one.
For when the
judge informed him that he was to die by fire,'

of the church of Gadara, and that Alphaeus belonged to a noble fam

the church of Caesarea.

and corresponded with our November (see below, p. 403).

Baoriaeus was the so term for emperor, and it is plain enough
from this passage that these two men, like Procopius, were beheaded
because they were regarded as guilty of treason, not because of their
religious faith. The instances given in this chapter are very signif
icant, for they reveal the nature of the persecution during its earlier
months, and throw a clear light back upon the motives which had
led Diocletian to take the step against the Christians which he did.

1 We learn from the Syriac version, that the death of Romanus
occurred on the same day as that of Alphaeus and Zacchaeus. His
arrest, therefore, must have taken place some time before, according
to § 4, below.
In fact, we see from the present paragraph, that his
arrest took place in connection with the destruction of the churches;
that is, at J. time of the execution of the first edict in Antioch.
We should naturally think that the edict would be speedily published
in so important a city, and hence can hardly suppose the arrest
of Romanus to have occurred later than the spring of 303. He
therefore lay in prison a number of months (according to § 4, below,
a "very long time," taciorrow xpovov), Mason is clearly in error
in putting his arrest in November, and his death at the time of the
vicennalia, in December.
It is evident from the Syriac version that
the order for the release of prisoners, to which the so-called third
edict was appended, preceded the vicennalia by some weeks, although
issued in view of the great anniversary which was so near at hand.
It is quite possible that the decree was sent out some weeks before
hand, in order that time might be given to induce the Christians to
sacrifice, and thus enjoy release at the same time with the others.

* There is no implication here that these persons were com:
manded, or even asked, to sacrifice. They seem, in their dread of
what might come upon them, when they saw the churches demol
ished, to have hastened of their own accord to sacrifice to the idols,
and thus disarm all possible suspicion.
* As Mason remarks, to punish Romanus with death for dissuad
ing the Christians from sacrificing was entirely illegal, as no impe
rial edict requiring them to sacrifice had yet been issued, and there
fore no law was broken in exhorting them not to do so.
At the
same time, that he should be arrested as a church officer was, under
the terms of the second edict, legal, and, in fact, necessary; and that
the judge should incline to be very severe in the present, case, with
the emperor so near at hand, was quite natural. That death, how
ever, was not yet made the lo of Christian confession is plain
enough from d: fact that, when the emperor was appealed to, as we
learn from the Syriac version, he remanded Romanus to prison, thus

he received the sentence with cheerful counte
nance and most ready mind, and was led away.
When he was bound to the stake, and the wood
piled up around him, as they were awaiting the
arrival of the emperor before lighting the fire,
he cried, "Where is the fire for me?"
Having said this, he was summoned again
before the emperor," and subjected to the
unusual torture of having his tongue cut out.
But he endured this with fortitude and showed
to all by his deeds that the Divine Power is
present with those who endure any hardship
whatever for the sake of religion, lightening
their sufferings and strengthening their zeal.
When he learned of this strange mode of pun
ishment, the noble man was not terrified, but
put out his tongue readily, and offered it with
the greatest alacrity to those who cut it off.
After this punishment he was thrown into
prison, and suffered there for a very long
time.

native of Palestine, it is proper to count him
among the Palestinian martyrs.
These things
occurred in this manner during the first year,
when the persecution was directed only against
the rulers of the Church.

CHAPTER III.

l

IN the course of the second year, the
persecution against us increased greatly.
And at that time Urbanus' being governor of
the province, imperial edicts were first issued to
him, commanding by a general decree that all

the second edict. Upon the case of Romanus, see Mason, p. 188 sq.
* Walesius assumes that this was Galerius, and Mason does the
same. In the Syriac version, however, he is directly called Diocle
tian; but on the other hand, in the Syriac acts published by Asse
mani (according to Cureton, p. 55), he is, called "Maximinus, the
son-in-law of Diocletian"; i.e. čič, who was known as Maxi
mianus (of which Maximinus, in the present case, is evidently only
a variant form). The emperor's conduct in the present case is
much more in accord with §o character, as known to us, than
with the character of Diocletian; and moreover, it is easier to sup
ose that the name of Maximinus, was later changed into that of
}. by whose name the whole persecution was known, than
that the greater name was changed into the less.
I am therefore
convinced that the reference in the present case is to Galerius, not to
Diocletian.

1 Of Urbanus, governor of Palestine, we know only what is told
us in the present work (he is mentioned in this passage and in chaps.
4, 7, and 8, below) and in the Syriac version. From the latter we
learn that he succeeded Flavianus in the second year of the persecu
tion (304), and that he was deposed by Maximinus in the fifth year

In Gaza, a city of Palestine, Timotheus en
dured countless tortures, and afterwards was sub
jected to a slow and moderate fire.
Having
given, by his patience in all his sufferings, most
genuine evidence of sincerest piety toward the

and our contemporary, Thecla," having exhibited
most noble constancy, were condemned as food
for the wild beasts.

But who that beheld these things would
not have admired, or if they heard of them
by report, would not have been astonished?
For when the heathen everywhere were holding
a festival and the customary shows, it was noised
abroad that besides the other entertainments,
the public combat of those who had lately
been condemned to wild beasts would also

* This is the famous fourth edict of Diocletian, which was issued
in the year 3o4.
It marks a stupendous change of method; in fact,
Christianity as such is made, for the first time since the toleration
edict of Gallienus, a religio illicita, whose profession is punishable
by death. The general persecution, in the full sense; begins with
the publication off. edict. Hitherto persecution had been directed
only against supposed political offenders and church officers. The
edict is a complete stultification of Diocletian's principles as revealed
in the first three edicts, and shows a lamentable lack of the wisdom
which had dictated those measures. Mason has performed an im
mense service in proving (to my opinion conclusively) that this
brutal edict, senseless in its very severity, was not issued by Dio
cletian, but by Maximian, while Diocletian was quite incapacitated
by illness for the performance of any public duties.
Mason's argu
ments cannot be reproduced here; they are given at length on p.
212 sq. of his work. He remarks at the close of the discussion:
"Diocletian, though he might have wished Christianity safely abol
ished, feared the growing power of the Church, and dared not per
secute (till he was forced), lest he should rouse her from her passivity.
But this Fourth Edict was nothing more nor less than a loud alarum
to muster the army of the Church: as the centurions called over
their lists, it taught her the statistics of her numbers, down to the
last child: it proved to her that her troops could endure all the
hardships of the campaign: it ranged her generals in the exact
order of merit.
Diocletian, by an exquisite refinement of thought,
while he did not neglect the salutary fear which strong penalties
might inspire in the Christians, knew well enough that though he
might torture every believer, in , the world into sacrificing, yet
he knew that men were Christians

men and angels converted many a hard and worldly prelate into a
broken-hearted saint; and so he rested his hopes, not merely on the
punishment of individuals, but on his three great measures for
crushing the corporate life, - the destruction oš'. churches, the
Scriptures, and the clergy.
But this Fourth Edict evidently returns
with crass dullness and brutal complacency to the thought that if
half the church were racked till they poured the libations, and the
other half burned or butchered, Paganism would reign alone forever
more, and that the means were as eminently desirable as the end.
Lastly, Diocletian had anxiously avoided all that could rouse
fanatic zeal. The first result of the Fourth Edict was to rouse it."

According to the Pass to S. Sabini, which Mason accepts as in
the main reliable, and which forms the strongest support for his
theory, the edict was published in April, 304.
Diocletian, mean
while, as we know from Lactantius (de Mort. Aers. 17) did not re
cover sufficiently to take any part in the government until early in
the year 305, so that Maximian and Galerius had matters all their
own way during the entire year, and could persecute as severely as
they chose. As a result, the Christians, both east and west, suffered
greatly during this period.

* Agapius, as we learn from chap. 6, below, survived his contest
with the wild beasts at this time, and was thrown into prison, where
he remained until the fourth year of the persecution, when he was
again brought into the arena in the presence of the tyrant Maximi
nus, and was finally thrown into the sea.

After

One of them, named Agapius," had in former
confessions endured dreadful torments of vari

with the necessaries of life, was called Diony

All of these eight were beheaded on one

the emperors occurred, and the first of them
all in dignity, and the second retired into private

Shortly after the Roman government be
came divided against itself, and a cruel war
arose among them." And this division, with the
troubles which grew out of it, was not settled
until peace toward us had been established
throughout the entire Roman Empire. For
when this peace arose for all, as the day
light after the darkest and most gloomy night,
the public affairs of the Roman government
were re-established, and became happy and
peaceful, and the ancestral good-will toward
each other was revived.
But we will relate these
things more fully at the proper time. Now let
us return to the regular course of events.

cution against us more vigorously than his
predecessors.
In consequence, no little
confusion arose among all, and they scat
tered here and there, endeavoring in some way
to escape the danger; and there was great com
motion everywhere.

But what words would suffice for a suitable
description of the Divine love and boldness, in
confessing God, of the blessed and truly inno
cent lamb, - I refer to the martyr Apphianus,"
- who presented in the sight of all, before the
gates of Caesarea, a wonderful example of
piety toward the only God? He was at
that time not twenty years old. He had first
spent a long time at Berytus," for the sake of a
secular Grecian education, as he belonged to a
very wealthy family.
It is wonderful to relate
how, in such a city, he was superior to youthful
passions, and clung to virtue, uncorrupted neither
by his bodily vigor nor his young companions;
living discreetly, soberly and piously, in accord
ance with his profession of the Christian doc
trine and the life of his teachers.

If it is needful to mention his native
country, and give honor to it as producing
this noble athlete of piety, we will do so
with pleasure. The young man came from
Pagae,"- if any one is acquainted with the
place, - a city in Lycia of no mean importance.
After his return from his course of study in Bery
tus, though his father held the first place in his
country, he could not bear to live with him and
his relatives, as it did not please them to live
according to the rules of religion.
Therefore,
as if he were led by the Divine Spirit, and in
accordance with a natural, or rather an inspired
and true philosophy, regarding this preferable
to what is considered the glory of life, and de
spising bodily comforts, he secretly left his fam
ily. And because of his faith and hope in God,
paying no attention to his daily needs, he was
led by the Divine Spirit to the city of Caesarea,
where was prepared for him the crown of
martyrdom for piety. Abiding with us there,
and conferring with us in the Divine Scrip
tures diligently for a short time, and fitting him
self zealously by suitable exercises, he exhibited
such an end as would astonish any one
should it be seen again. Who, that hears
of it, would not justly admire his courage,

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[MART. PAL.

the daring deed itself, which evidenced a zeal
for religion and a spirit truly superhuman 2
For in the second attack upon us under
Maximinus, in the third year of the persecu
tion, edicts of the tyrant were issued for the
first time, commanding that the rulers of the
cities should diligently and speedily see to it
that all the people offered sacrifices." Through
out the city of Caesarea, by command of the
governor, the heralds were summoning men,
women, and children to the temples of the idols,
and besides this, the chiliarchs were calling out
each one by name from a roll, and an immense
crowd of the wicked were rushing together from
all quarters. Then this youth fearlessly, while
no one was aware of his intentions, eluded both
us who lived in the house with him and the
whole band of soldiers that surrounded the
governor, and rushed up to Urbanus as he was
offering libations, and fearlessly seizing him by
the right hand, straightway put a stop to his
sacrificing, and skillfully and persuasively, with
a certain divine inspiration, exhorted him to
abandon his delusion, because it was not well
to forsake the one and only true God, and
sacrifice to idols and demons.
It is prob
able that this was done by the youth through
a divine power which led him forward, and which
all but cried aloud in his act, that Christians,
who were truly such, were so far from abandon
ing the religion of the God of the universe
which they had once espoused, that they were
not only superior to threats and the punish
ments which followed, but yet bolder to speak
with noble and untrammeled tongue, and, if pos
sible, to summon even their persecutors to turn
from their ignorance and acknowledge the only

true God.

Thereupon, he of whom we are speaking,
and that instantly, as might have been ex
pected after so bold a deed, was torn by the
governor and those who were with him as if by
wild beasts. And having endured manfully in
numerable blows over his entire body, he
was straightway cast into prison. There
he was stretched by the tormentor with both
his feet in the stocks for a night and a day; and
the next day he was brought before the judge.
As they endeavored to force him to surrender,
he exhibited all constancy under suffering and
terrible tortures.
His sides were torn, not once
or twice, but many times, to the bones and the
very bowels; and he received so many blows on
his face and neck that those who for a long time
had been well acquainted with him could

For as soon as
they had cast this truly sacred and thrice

sea, an uncommon commotion and disturbance
agitated the sea and all the shore about it, so
that the land and the entire city were shaken
by it. And at the same time with this wonder
ful and sudden perturbation, the sea threw out
before the gates of the city the body of the di
vine martyr, as if unable to endure it."

Such was the death of the wonderful Apphi

month Xanthicus, which is the fourth day before
the Nones of April, on the day of preparation."

* It is perhaps not necessary to doubt that an earthquake took
place at this particular time.
Nor is it surprising that under
the circumstances the Christians saw a miracle in a natural phe
nomenon.

7 Xanthicus was the eighth month of the Macedonian year, and
corresponded to our '...i (see table on p. 403, below). The mar
tyrdom of Apphianus must have taken place in 306, not 305; for
according to the direct testimony of Lactantius (de Mort. Aers.
chap, 19; the statement is unaccountably omitted in the English
translation given in the Ante-Virene Fathers), Maximinus did not
become Caesar until May 1, 305; while, according to the present
chapter, Apphianus suffered martyrdom after Maximinus had been
raised to that position.
Eusebius himself puts the abdication
of the old emperors and the appointment of the new Caesars early
in April or late in March (see above, chap. 3, § 5, and the Syriac
version of the Martyrs, p. 12), and with # agree other early
authorities.
But it is more difficult to doubt the accuracy of Lac
tantius' dates than to suppose the others mistaken, and hence
May 1st is commonly accepted by historians as the day of abdica
tion. About the year there can be no question; for Lactantius'
account of Diocletian's movements during the previous year exhibits
a very exact knowledge of the course of events, and its accuracy

cation, see Tillemont's Host. des EmA., 2d ed., IV. p. 609.)
But
even if it were admitted that the abdication took place four or five
weeks earlier (according to Eusebius' own statement, it did not at
any rate occur before the twenty-fourth of March: see chap. 3,
above, and the Syriac version, p. 12), it would be impossible to put
Apphianus' death on the second of April, for this would not give
time for all that must intervene between the day of his appointment
and the republication and execution of the persecuting edicts.

Shortly afterwards, AEdesius," a brother
of Apphianus, not only in God, but also
in the flesh, being a son of the same earthly
father, endured sufferings like his, after very
many confessions and protracted tortures in
bonds, and after he had been sentenced by the
governor to the mines in Palestine. He con
ducted himself through them all in a truly phil
osophic manner; for he was more highly edu
cated than his brother, and had prosecuted
philosophic studies.
Finally in the city of
Alexandria, when he beheld the judge, who
was trying the Christians, offending beyond all
bounds, now insulting holy men in various ways,
and again consigning women of greatest modesty
and even religious virgins to procurers for shame
ful treatment, he acted like his brother.
For as
these things seemed insufferable, he went for
ward with bold resolve, and with his words and
deeds overwhelmed the judge with shame and
disgrace.
After suffering in consequence many
forms of torture, he endured a death similar to

things, as I have said, happened to him in this
way a little later.

ABOUT the same time, in the city of Tyre, of record, occurred in the city of Caesarea.
As it was an ancient custom to furnish the
spectators more splendid shows when the
emperors were present than at other times, -
new and foreign spectacles taking the place of
the customary amusements, such as animals
brought from
other
or
places, or men who could astonish the behold
ers with skillful bodily exercises, - it was neces
sary at this time, as the emperor was giving
the exhibition, to add to the shows something
more wonderful. And what should this be?
A witness of our doctrine was brought into
the midst and endured the contest for the
true and only religion.
This was Agapius, who,
as we have stated a little above," was, with Thec
la, the second to be thrown to the wild beasts
for food. He had also, three times and more,
marched with malefactors from the prison to the
arena; and every time, after threats from the
judge, whether in compassion or in hope that
he might change his mind, had been reserved
for other conflicts.
But the emperor being
present, he was brought out at this time, as if
he had been appropriately reserved for this
occasion, until the very word of the Saviour
should be fulfilled in him, which through divine
knowledge he declared to his disciples, that they
should be brought before kings on account
of their testimony unto him." He was taken
into the midst of the arena with a certain
malefactor who they said was charged with
the murder of his master.
But this murderer of his master, when he had been cast
to the wild beasts, was deemed worthy of com
passion and humanity, almost like Barabbas in

resounded with shouts and cries of approval,
because the murderer was humanely saved by
the emperor, and deemed worthy of honor
and freedom.
But the athlete of religion
was first summoned by the tyrant and prom
ised liberty if he would deny his profession.
But he testified with a loud voice that, not for
any fault, but for the religion of the Creator of
the universe, he would readily and with pleasure
endure whatever might be inflicted upon
him.
Having said this, he joined the deed
to the word, and rushed to meet a bear

CHAPTER VII.

AGAIN, in Caesarea, when the persecution
had continued to the fifth year, on the sec
ond day of the month Xanthicus,' which is the
fourth before the Nones of April, on the very
Lord's day of our Saviour's resurrection," Theo
dosia, a virgin from Tyre, a faithful and sedate
maiden, not yet eighteen years of age, went up to
certain prisoners who were confessing the king
dom of Christ and sitting before the judgment
seat, and saluted them, and, as is probable, be
sought them to remember her when they
came before the Lord. Thereupon, as if she
had committed a profane and impious act,
the soldiers seized her and led her to the gov
ernor. And he immediately, like a madman and
a wild beast in his anger, tortured her with dread
ful and most terrible torments in her sides and
breasts, even to the very bones. And as she still
breathed, and withal stood with a joyful and
beaming countenance, he ordered her thrown into
the waves of the sea. Then passing from her to
the other confessors, he condemned all of them
to the copper mines in Phaeno in Palestine.
Afterwards on the fifth of the month Dius,"
on the Nones of November according to
the Romans, in the same city, Silvanus" (who
at that time was a presbyter and confessor, but
who shortly after was honored with the epis
copate and died a martyr), and those with
him, men who had shown the noblest firmness
in behalf of religion, were condemned by him
to labor in the same copper mines, command

beginning before the second of April, and the latter date as falling
early in a new year of the persecution. That the martyrdom re.
... in the present case actually took place in 307, and not in 308,
as it must have done if Eusebius were consistent with himself, is
proved, first, by the fact that, in entering upon this new chapter, he
says, "the persecution having continued to the fifth year," implying
thereby that the event which he is about to relate took place at the
beginning, not at the end, of the fifth: year; and secondly, by the
fact that i. on, in this same chapter, while still relating #: cvents
of the fifth year; he recounts martyrdoms as taking place in the
month of November (Dius).
This is conclusive, for November of
the fifth year can be only November, 307, and hence the April men.
tioned in the present paragraph can be only April of the same year.
Evidently Eusebius did not reckon the beginning of the persecution
in Palestine from a fixed day, but rather from the month Xanthicus
(April). As a consequence, the inconsistency into which he has
fallen is not very strange; the second day of April might easily be
reckoned either as one of the closing days of a year, or as the begin
ning, of the ensuing, year. . In the present case, he cvidently forgot
that he had previously used the former reckoning.

being first given that their ankles be dis
abled with hot irons.
At the same time he
delivered to the flames a man who was il
lustrious through numerous other confessions.
This was Domninus, who was well known to all
in
for his exceeding fearlessness."
After this the same judge, who was a cruel con
triver of suffering, and an inventor of devices
against the doctrine of Christ, planned against
the pious punishments that had never been heard
of. He condemned three to single pugilistic
combat. He delivered to be devoured by wild
beasts Auxentius, a grave and holy old man.
Others who were in mature life he made eunuchs,
and condemned them to the same mines.
Yet
others, after severe tortures, he cast into prison.
Among these was my dearest friend Pamphi
lus," who was by reason of every virtue the
most illustrious of the martyrs in our time.
Urbanus first tested him in rhetorical philosophy and learning; and afterwards en
deavored to compel him to sacrifice.
But as
he saw that he refused and in nowise regarded
his threats, being exceedingly angry, he ordered
him to be tormented with severest tortures.
And when the brutal man, after he had
almost satiated himself with these tortures
by continuous and prolonged scrapings in his
sides, was yet covered with shame before all, he
put him also with the confessors in prison.
But what recompense for his cruelty to
the saints, he who thus abused the martyrs
of Christ, shall receive from the Divine judg
ment, may be easily determined from the pre
ludes to it, in which immediately, and not long
after his daring cruelties against Pamphilus, while
he yet held the government, the Divine judg
ment came upon him. For thus suddenly, he who
but yesterday was judging on the lofty tribunal,
guarded by a band of soldiers, and ruling over
the whole nation of Palestine, the associate and
dearest friend and table companion of the tyrant
himself, was stripped in one night, and over
whelmed with disgrace and shame before those
who had formerly admired him as if he were him
self an emperor; and he appeared cowardly and
unmanly, uttering womanish cries and supplica
tions to all the people whom he had ruled. And
Maximinus himself, in reliance upon whose favor
Urbanus was formerly so arrogantly insolent,
as if he loved him exceedingly for his deeds
against us, was set as a harsh and most severe
judge in this same Caesarea to pronounce sen
tence of death against him, for the great dis
grace of the crimes of which he was con
victed.
Let us say this in passing. A suitable time may come when we shall have leisure to relate the end and the fate of those impious

Up to the sixth year the storm had
Before
this time there had been a very large number
of confessors of religion in the so-called Por
phyry quarry in Thebais, which gets its name
from the stone found there.
Of these, one
hundred men, lacking three, together with women
and infants, were sent to the governor of Pales
tine. When they confessed the God of the uni
verse and Christ, Firmilianus,' who had been
sent there as governor in the place of Urbanus,
directed, in accordance with the imperial com
mand, that they should be maimed by burning
the sinews of the ankles of their left feet, and
that their right eyes with the eyelids and pupils
should first be cut out, and then destroyed by
hot irons to the very roots. And he then sent
them to the mines in the province to endure
hardships with severe toil and suffering.

But it was not sufficient that these only
who suffered such miseries should be de
prived of their eyes, but those natives of Pales
tine also, who were mentioned just above as
condemned to pugilistic combat, since they

count not only before the overseers, but also
before Maximinus himself, and having man
ifested the noblest persistence in confession
by the endurance of hunger and stripes, they
received like punishment with those whom we
have mentioned, and with them other con
fessors in the city of Caesarea.
Immedi
ately afterwards others who were gathered
to hear the Scriptures read, were seized in Gaza,
and some endured the same sufferings in the
feet and eyes; but others were afflicted with
yet greater torments and with most terrible
tortures in the sides.
One of these, in
body a woman, but in understanding a man,
would not endure the threat of fornication, and
spoke directly against the tyrant who entrusted
the government to such cruel judges.

It is quite possible
that Eusebius, in the present case, is referring to a more detailed
statement of the fates of the various persecutors, which was to form
the second part of the present work; and it is possible, still further,
that the appendix printed at the close of the eighth book is a frag

stake, and her sides lacerated.
As those
appointed for this purpose applied the tor
tures incessantly and severely at the command
of the judge, another, with mind fixed, like the
former, on virginity as her aim, -a woman who
was altogether mean in form and contemptible
in appearance, but, on the other hand, strong
in soul, and endowed with an understanding
superior to her body, - being unable to bear
the merciless and cruel and inhuman deeds,
with a boldness beyond that of the combatants
famed among the Greeks, cried out to the judge
from the midst of the crowd: "And how long
will you thus cruelly torture my sister?"
But
he was greatly enraged, and ordered the
woman to be immediately seized.
Thereupon she was brought forward and having
called herself by the august name of the Sav
iour, she was first urged by words to sacrifice,
and as she refused she was dragged by force to
the altar.
But her sister continued to main
tain her former zeal, and with intrepid and
resolute foot kicked the altar, and over
turned it with the fire that was on it. Thereupon the judge, enraged like a wild beast,
inflicted on her such tortures in her sides as
he never had on any one before, striving al
most to glut himself with her raw flesh.
But
when his madness was satiated, he bound them
both together, this one and her whom she
called sister, and condemned them to death
by fire.
It is said that the first of these was
from the country of Gaza; the other, by name
Valentina, was of Caesarea, and was well known
to many.

But how can I describe as it deserves the
martyrdom which followed, with which the
thrice-blessed Paul was honored. He was con
demned to death at the same time with them,
under one sentence.
At the time of his mar
tyrdom, as the executioner was about to cut
off his head, he requested a brief respite.
This being granted, he first, in a clear and
distinct voice, supplicated God in behalf of
his fellow-Christians," praying for their pardon,
and that freedom might soon be restored to
them. Then he asked for the conversion of
the Jews to God through Christ; and proceed

the Samaritans, and besought that those Gen

This took
place on the twenty-fifth day of the month

Such was the end of these persons.

But
not long after, one hundred and thirty ad
mirable athletes of the confession of Christ, from
the land of Egypt, endured, in Egypt itself, at the
command of Maximinus the same afflictions in
their eyes and feet with the former persons, and
were sent to the above-mentioned mines in Pal
estine.
But some of them were condemned to
the mines in Cilicia.

AFTER such noble acts of the distin
guished martyrs of Christ, the flame of per
secution lessened, and was quenched, as it were,
by their sacred blood, and relief and liberty were
granted to those who, for Christ's sake, were
laboring in the mines of Thebais, and for a

But there is in it
a thin bitterness, a venomous spitefulness, which may be noticed as

This spiteful

point. The second fact was that the Church had no longer to deal
with the sensible, statesmanlike hostility of Diocletian, - not even
with the bluff bloodiness of Maximian.

It must have

appeared to them extreme and burdensome.

As the heaviest storm impended over all in
every quarter, the divine power of our Saviour
again infused such boldness into his athletes,"
that without being drawn on or dragged forward
by any one, they spurned the threats.
Three of the faithful joining together, rushed
on the governor as he was sacrificing to the
idols, and cried out to him to cease from his
delusion, there being no other God than the
Maker and Creator of the universe. When he
asked who they were, they confessed boldly
that they were Christians. Thereupon Firmilianus, being greatly enraged, sentenced
them to capital punishment without inflicting
tortures upon them. The name of the eldest
of these was Antoninus; of the next, Zebinas,
who was a native of Eleutheropolis ; and of
the third, Germanus.
This took place on the

all her clothing, so that she was covered only
from her loins to her feet and the rest of her body
was bare. And he led her through the entire city
of Caesarea, and regarded it as a great thing to
beat her with thongs while she was dragged
through all the market-places.
After such
treatment she manifested the noblest con
stancy at the judgment seat of the governor him
self; and the judge condemned her to be burned
alive. He also carried his rage against the pious
to a most inhuman length and transgressed the
laws of nature, not being ashamed even to deny
burial to the lifeless bodies of the sacred
men. Thus he ordered the dead to be ex
posed in the open air as food for wild beasts
and to be watched carefully by night and day.
For many days a large number of men attended
to this savage and barbarous decree. And they
looked out from their post of observation, as if
it were a matter worthy of care, to see that the
dead bodies should not be stolen. And wild
beasts and dogs and birds of prey scattered the
human limbs here and there, and the whole city
was strewed with the entrails and bones of
men, so that nothing had ever appeared
more dreadful and horrible, even to those
who formerly hated us; though they bewailed
not so much the calamity of those against whom
these things were done, as the outrage against
themselves and the common nature of man.
For there was to be seen near the gates a
spectacle beyond all description and tragic
recital; for not only was human flesh devoured
in one place, but it was scattered in every place;
so that some said that limbs and masses of flesh
and parts of entrails were to be seen even within

the gates.

After these things had continued for many
days, a wonderful event occurred. The air
was clear and bright and the appearance of the
sky most serene. When suddenly throughout
the city from the pillars which supported the
public porches many drops fell like tears; and
the market places and streets, though there was
no mist in the air, were moistened with sprinkled
water, whence I know not. Then immediately
it was reported everywhere that the earth, unable
to endure the abomination of these things, had
shed tears in a mysterious manner; and that as
a rebuke to the relentless and unfeeling nature
of men, stones and lifeless wood had wept for
what had happened.
I know well that this ac
count may perhaps appear idle and fabulous to
those who come after us, but not to those to
whom the truth was confirmed at the time."

1 This is a glaring instance of uncritical credulity on Eusebius'
part, and yet even Cruse can say: "Perhaps some might smile at
the supposed credulity of our author, but the miracle in this ac
count was not greater than the malignity, and if man can perform
miracles of vice, we can scarcely wonder if Providence should pre
sent, at least, miracles of admonition." Cureton more sensibly re

were again seized by those who examined peo
ple passing the gates. They had been sent to
minister to the confessors in Cilicia. They re
ceived the same sentence as those whom they
had gone to help, being mutilated in their eyes
and feet.
Three of them exhibited in Ascalon,
where they were imprisoned, marvelous bravery
in the endurance of various kinds of martyrdom.
One of them named Ares was condemned to
the flames, and the others, called Probus * and
Elias, were beheaded.

On the eleventh day of the month Audynaeus," which is the third before the Ides of
January, in the same city of Caesarea, Peter an
ascetic, also called Apselamus," from the village
of Anea," on the borders of Eleutheropolis, like
purest gold, gave noble proof by fire of his faith
in the Christ of God. Though the judge and
those around him besought him many times to
have compassion on himself, and to spare his
own youth and bloom, he disregarded them, pre
ferring hope in the God of the universe to all
things, even to life itself. A certain Asclepius,
supposed to be "a bishop of the sect of Marcion,
possessed as he thought with zeal for religion,
but "not according to knowledge,"' ended his
life on one and the same funeral pyre. These
things took place in this manner.

CHAPTER XI.

It is time to describe the great and celebrated spectacle of Pamphilus,' a man thrice
dear to me, and of those who finished their
course with him. They were twelve in all; being
counted worthy of apostolic grace and num
ber. Of these the leader and the only one
honored with the position of presbyter at
Caesarea, was Pamphilus ; a man who through

marks: "This, which doubtless was produced by natural causes,
seemed miraculous to Eusebius, more especially if he looked upon
it as fulfilling a prophecy of our Lord - |. xix. 4o: ‘I tell you,
that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately
cry out.'

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[MART. PAL.

his entire life was celebrated for every virtue,
for renouncing and despising the world, for shar
ing his possessions with the needy, for contempt
of earthly hopes, and for philosophic deport
ment and exercise. He especially excelled all
in our time in most sincere devotion to the
Divine Scriptures and indefatigable industry in
whatever he undertook, and in his helpful
ness to his relatives and associates.
In a
separate treatise on his life," consisting of
three books, we have already described the excel
lence of his virtue.
Referring to this work those
who delight in such things and desire to know
them, letus now consider the martyrsin order.
Second after Pamphilus, Vales, who was
honored for his venerable gray hair, entered
the contest. He was a deacon from AElia," an
old man of gravest appearance, and versed in the
Divine Scriptures, if any one ever was. He had
so laid up the memory of them in his heart that
he did not need to look at the books if he under
took to repeat any passage of Scripture.

The third was Paul from the city of
Jamna," who was known among them as
most zealous and fervent in spirit.
Previous to
his martyrdom, he had endured the conflict of
confession by cauterization.

After these persons had continued in prison
for two entire years, the occasion of their mar
tyrdom was a second arrival of Egyptian
brethren who suffered with them.
They
had accompanied the confessors in Cili
cia to the mines there and were returning to
At the entrance of the gates of
their homes.
Caesarea, the guards, who were men of barba
rous character, questioned them as to who they
were and whence they came. They kept back
nothing of the truth, and were seized as malefac
tors taken in the very act. They were five
in number. When brought before the ty
rant, being very bold in his presence, they
were immediately thrown into prison. On the
next day, which was the nineteenth of the month
Peritius," according to the Roman reckoning
the fourteenth before the Kalends of March, they
were brought, according to command, before the
judge, with Pamphilus and his associates whom
we have mentioned.
First, by all kinds of tor
ture, through the invention of strange and vari
ous machines, he tested the invincible constancy

Jamna, or Jamnia, was a town of

Judea, lying west of Jerusalem, near the sea.

* i.e. Feb. 19 (see the table on p. 403, below). We learn from
chap. 7, §§ 3-5, that Pamphilus was thrown into prison in the fifth
ear of the persecution and as late as November of that year, i.e.
{on November, 307, and April, 308.
Since he had lain two
whole years in prison (according to § 5, above), the date referred to
in the present passage must be February of the year 31 o. The mar
tyrdom of Pamphilus is commonly, for aught I know to the contrary,
uniformly put in the year 399, as the seventh year of the persecu
tion is nearly synchronous with that year.
But that the common
date is a mistake is plain enough from the present chapter.

of the Egyptians.
Having practised these
cruelties upon the leader" of all, he asked
him first who he was. He heard in reply the name
of some prophet instead of his proper name.
For it was their custom, in place of the names
of idols given them by their fathers, if they had
such, to take other names; so that you would
hear them calling themselves Elijah or Jeremiah
or Isaiah or Samuel or Daniel, thus showing
themselves inwardly true Jews, and the genuine
Israel of God, not only in deeds, but in the
names which they bore. When Firmilianus had
heard some such name from the martyr, and did
not understand the force of the word, he
asked next the name of his country.
But
he gave a second answer similar to the for
mer, saying that Jerusalem was his country,
meaning that of which Paul says, "Jerusalem
which is above is free, which is our mother,""
and, "Ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto
the city of the living God, the heavenly Je
rusalem."?
This was what he meant; but
the judge thinking only of the earth, sought
diligently to discover what that city was, and in
what part of the world it was situated. And
therefore he applied tortures that the truth
might be acknowledged.
But the man, with
his hands twisted behind his back, and his feet
crushed by strange machines, asserted firmly
that he had spoken the truth. And being
questioned again repeatedly what and where
the city was of which he spoke, he said that it
was the country of the pious alone, for no
others should have a place in it, and that it
lay toward the far East and the rising sun.
He philosophized about these things ac
cording to his own understanding, and was
in nowise turned from them by the tortures with
which he was afflicted on every side. And as if
he were without flesh or body he seemed insen
sible of his sufferings.
But the judge being
perplexed, was impatient, thinking that the
Christians were about to establish a city some
where, inimical and hostile to the Romans.
And he inquired much about this, and investi
gated where that country toward the East
was located.
But when he had for a long
time lacerated the young man with scourg
ings, and punished him with all sorts of tor
ments, he perceived that his persistence in what
he had said could not be changed, and passed
against him sentence of death.
Such a scene
was exhibited by what was done to this man.
And having inflicted similar tortures on the others,
he sent them away in the same manner.

Then being wearied and perceiving that

PAMPHILUS AND

HIS COMPANIONS.

he punished the men in vain, having satiated
his desire, he proceeded against Pamphilus and
his companions. And having learned that al
ready under former tortures they had manifested
an unchangeable zeal for the faith, he asked them
if they would now obey. And receiving from
every one of them only this one answer, as their
last word of confession in martyrdom, he inflicted
on them punishment similar to the others.
When this had been done, a young man,
one of the household servants of Pamphilus,
who had been educated in the noble life and
instruction of such a man, learning the sentence
passed upon his master, cried out from the
midst of the crowd asking that their bodies
might be buried.
Thereupon the judge,
not a man, but a wild beast, or if anything
more savage than a wild beast, giving no con
sideration to the young man's age, asked him
only the same question. When he learned that
he confessed himself a Christian, as if he had
been wounded by a dart, swelling with rage, he
ordered the tormentors to use their utmost
power against him. And when he saw that
he refused to sacrifice as commanded, he
ordered them to scrape him continually to his
very bones and to the inmost recesses of his
bowels, not as if he were human flesh but as if
he were stones or wood or any lifeless thing.
But after long persistence he saw that this was
in vain, as the man was speechless and insensible
and almost lifeless, his body being worn out
by the tortures.
But being inflexibly merci
less and inhuman, he ordered him to be
committed straightway, as he was, to a slow fire.
And before the death of his earthly master,
though he had entered later on the conflict, he
received release from the body, while those who
had been zealous about the others were yet
delaying. One could then see Porphyry,"
like one who had come off victorious in every
conflict, his body covered with dust, but his
countenance cheerful, after such sufferings, with
courageous and exulting mind, advancing to
death. And as if truly filled with the Divine
Spirit, covered only with his philosophic robe
thrown about him as a cloak, soberly and intelli
gently he directed his friends as to what he
wished, and beckoned to them, preserving still

Such was the contest of

His death was reported to Pamphilus

of the confessors from the army.
As the
bearer of such a message, he was forthwith
deemed worthy of a similar lot.
For as soon
as he related the death of Porphyry, and had
saluted one of the martyrs with a kiss, some
of the soldiers seized him and led him to the
governor. And he, as if he would hasten him on
to be a companion of the former on the way to
heaven, commanded that he be put to death
immediately. This man was from Cappado
cia, and belonged to the select band of sol
diers, and had obtained no small honor in those
things which are esteemed among the Romans.
For in stature and bodily strength, and size and
vigor, he far excelled his fellow-soldiers, so that
his appearance was matter of common talk, and
his whole form was admired on account of
its size and symmetrical proportions.
At
the beginning of the persecution he was
prominent in the conflicts of confession, through
his patience under scourging.
After he left the
army he set himself to imitate zealously the re
ligious ascetics, and as if he were their father
and guardian he showed himself a bishop and
patron of destitute orphans and defenceless
widows and of those who were distressed with
penury or sickness.
It is likely that on this
account he was deemed worthy of an extraor
dinary call to martyrdom by God, who rejoices
in such things more than in the smoke and
blood of sacrifices. He was the tenth ath
lete among those whom we have mentioned
as meeting their end on one and the same day.
On this day, as was fitting, the chief gate was
opened, and a ready way of entrance into the
kingdom of heaven was given to the martyr
Pamphilus and to the others with him.
In the footsteps of Seleucus came Theo
dulus, a grave and pious old man, who be
longed to the governor's household, and had
been honored by Firmilianus himself more than
all the others in his house on account of his
age, and because he was a father of the third
generation, and also on account of the kindness
and most faithful conscientiousness which he

whom we have spoken, Julian came to complete
it. He had just arrived from abroad, and had
not yet entered the gate of the city, when hav
ing learned about the martyrs while still on the
way, he rushed at once, just as he was, to see
them. When he beheld the tabernacles of the
saints prone on the ground, being filled with
joy, he embraced and kissed them all.

him as he was doing this and led him to

demned him to a slow fire.
Thereupon Julian,
leaping and exulting, in a loud voice gave thanks
to the Lord who had judged him worthy of such
things, and was honored with the crown
of martyrdom. He was a Cappadocian by
birth, and in his manner of life he was most
circumspect, faithful and sincere, zealous in all
other respects, and animated by the Holy Spirit
himself.

Such was the company which was thought
worthy to enter into martyrdom with Pam
philus. By the command of the impious
governor their sacred and truly holy bodies
were kept as food for the wild beasts for four
days and as many nights.
But since, strange to
say, through the providential care of God, noth
ing approached them, -neither beast of prey,
nor bird, nor dog, - they were taken up unin
jured, and after suitable preparation were buried

in the customary manner.

When the report of what had been done
to these men was spread in all directions,
Adrianus and Eubulus, having come from the
so-called country of Manganaea" to Caesarea, to
see the remaining confessors, were also asked at
the gate the reason for their coming; and hav

delay inflicted many tortures in their sides, and
condemned them to be devoured by wild
beasts.
After two days, on the fifth of
the month Dystrus," the third before the
Nones of March, which was regarded as the
birthday of the tutelary divinity of Caesarea,"
Adrianus was thrown to a lion, and afterwards
slain with the sword.
But Eubulus, two days
later, on the Nones of March, that is, on the
seventh of the month Dystrus, when the judge
had earnestly entreated him to enjoy by sacrific
ing that which was considered freedom among
them, preferring a glorious death for religion to
transitory life, was made like the other an offer

in Caesarea, sealed the list of athletes.

It is proper also to relate here, how in a
short time the heavenly Providence came
upon the impious rulers, together with the tyrants
themselves.
For that very Firmilianus, who had
thus abused the martyrs of Christ, after suffering
with the others the severest punishment, was put
to death by the sword.

Such were the martyrdoms which took place
at Caesarea during the entire period of the per
secution.

CHAPTER XII.

I THINK it best to pass by all the other events
which occurred in the meantime : such as those
which happened to the bishops of the churches,
when instead of shepherds of the rational' flocks of
Christ, over which they presided in an unlawful
manner, the divine judgment, considering them
worthy of such a charge, made them keepers of
camels," an irrational beast" and very crooked in
the structure of its body, or condemned them to
have the care of the imperial horses; - and
I pass by also the insults and disgraces and tor
tures they endured from the imperial overseers
and rulers on account of the sacred vessels and
treasures of the Church; and besides these the
lust of power on the part of many, the disorderly
and unlawful ordinations, and the schisms among
the confessors themselves; also the novelties
which were zealously devised against the rem
nants of the Church by the new and factious
members, who added innovation after innovation
and forced them in unsparingly among the calam
ities of the persecution, heaping misfortune upon
misfortune.
I judge it more suitable to shun
and avoid the account of these things, as I said
at the beginning."
But such things as are sober
and praiseworthy, according to the sacred word,
- "and if there be any virtue and praise,"*-
I consider it most proper to tell and to record,
and to present to believing hearers in the his
tory of the admirable martyrs. And after this
I think it best to crown the entire work with
an account of the peace which has appeared
unto us from heaven.

had continued into the eighth year were gradu
ally and quietly becoming less severe. A large
number of confessors were collected at the cop
per mines in Palestine, and were acting with
considerable boldness, so far as even to build
places of worship.
But the ruler of the prov
ince, a cruel and wicked man, as his acts against
the martyrs showed, having come there and
learned the state of affairs, communicated it to
the emperor, writing in accusation what
ever he thought best.
Thereupon, being
appointed superintendent of the mines, he
divided the band of confessors as if by a royal
decree, and sent some to dwell in Cyprus and
others in Lebanon, and he scattered others in
different parts of Palestine and ordered
them to labor in various works.
And, se
lecting the four who seemed to him to be
the leaders, he sent them to the commander of
the armies in that section.

There were others there who had been

them, and set a worthy and genuine ex

throughout its entire continuance, been eminent
for his confessions in all sorts of conflicts, had

of the Divine Scriptures, "not in tables
of
stone" " as the divine apostle says, neither on
skins of animals, nor on paper which moths and
time destroy, but truly "in fleshy tables of the
heart," " in a transparent soul and most pure
eye of the mind, so that whenever he wished he
could repeat, as if from a treasury of words, any
portion of the Scripture, whether in the law, or the
prophets, or the historical books, or the gospels,
or the writings of the apostles.

I confess that I was astonished when I
first saw the man as he was standing in the
midst of a large congregation and repeating
portions of the Divine Scripture.
While I only
heard his voice, I thought that, according to the
custom in the meetings, he was reading.
But
when I came near and perceived what he was
doing, and observed all the others standing
around him with sound eyes while he was using
only the eyes of his mind, and yet was speak
ing naturally like some prophet, and far excell
ing those who were sound in body, it was im
possible for me not to glorify God and wonder.
And I seemed to see in these deeds evident and
strong confirmation of the fact that true man
hood consists not in excellence of bodily ap
pearance, but in the soul and understanding

fested the superior excellence of the power that
was within him.

But as to those whom we have mentioned
as abiding in a separate place, and attend
ing to their customary duties in fasting and
prayer and other exercises, God himself saw fit
to give them a salutary issue by extending his
right hand in answer to them. The bitter foe,
as
they were armed against him zealously
through their prayers to God, could no longer
endure them, and determined to slay and destroy
them from off the earth because they troubled
him. And God permitted him to accomplish
this, that he might not be restrained from
the wickedness he desired, and that at the same
time they might receive the prizes of their mani
fold conflicts.
Therefore at the command of
the most accursed Maximinus, forty, lacking
one," were beheaded in one day.

These martyrdoms were accomplished
in Palestine during eight complete years;
and of this description was the persecution in
our time.
Beginning with the demolition of
the churches, it increased greatly as the rulers
rose up from time to time against us.
In these
assaults the multiform and various conflicts of
those who wrestled in behalf of religion produced
an innumerable multitude of martyrs in every

THE imperial edict of recantation, which
has been quoted above,' was posted in all
parts of Asia and in the adjoining provinces.
After this had been done, Maximinus, the tyrant
in the East, - a most impious man, if there ever
was one, and most hostile to the religion of the
God of the universe, - being by no means satis
fied with its contents," instead of sending the
above-quoted decree to the governors under him,
gave them verbal commands to relax the
war against us.
For since he could not in
any other way oppose the decision of his
superiors, keeping the law which had been al
ready issued secret, and taking care that it
might not be made known in the district under
him, he gave an unwritten order to his gov
ernors that they should relax the persecution
against us. They communicated the com
mand to each other in writing.
Sabinus,"
at least, who was honored with the highest
official rank among them, communicated the
will of the emperor to the provincial governors
in a Latin epistle, the translation of which is as

follows:

"With continuous and most devoted ear
nestness their Majesties, our most divine
masters, the emperors," formerly directed the
minds of all men to follow the holy and correct
course of life, that those also who seemed to
live in a manner foreign to that of the Romans,
should render the worship due to the immortal
gods.
But the obstinacy and most unconquer
able determination of some went so far that they
could neither be turned back from their pur
pose by the just reason of the command, nor be
intimidated by the impending punishment.
Since therefore it has come to pass that by
such conduct many have brought them
selves into danger, their Majesties, our most
powerful masters, the emperors, in the exalted

Majesties' purpose to bring men into so great
danger for such a cause, have commanded their

that if any Christian be found engaging in the
worship of his own people, thou shouldst ab

shouldst not suppose it necessary to punish any
one on this pretext.
For it has been proved by
the experience of so long a time that they can
in no way be persuaded to abandon such
obstinate conduct.
Therefore it should be

istrates and district overseers' of every city,
that they may know that it is not necessary for
them to give further attention to this mat

Heinichen remarks:
"Sed non necessaria, credo, est harc emendatio, immto ea dem sere

fice re of eram dare sc. ut facile intelligatur / e r s e 7 to en at is
Ch r is to a n is , ultra hoc scriptum, id est, magi's yuame hoc
scripto est designatum." Closs interprets in the same way, translat
ing: "dass sie sich night weiter, als in diesem Schreiben befohlen ist,
mit den Christen zu befassen haben." The Greek, however, does not
seem to me to admit of this interpretation (it reads two yroev,
m epautépo attois Tourov too ypa ouatos (bpovriča move to 6at un
mpoa joeuv), and there seems to be no other alternative than to
change the word Ypáuuaros to mpgyuatos, or at least give it the
meaning of mpáYuaros, as Mason does, without emending the text
(though I am not aware that Ypsiuma can legitimately be rendered
in any such way).
I am inclined to think that the word negotium
stood in the original, and that it was translated by the word mpayu a.
Had epistola or litterae been used, referring to the present docu
ment, - and it could not well refer to anything else, - we should
expect Eusebius to translate by on to roam, for he calls the docu
ment an on to roam in § 3, above. On the other hand, if scriptura,
or any other similar word, had been used and translated ypau wa by
Eusebius, we should have expected him to call the document a
ypguna, not an ém a roam in § 3.

The general drist of the letter cannot be mistaken. As Mason
paraphrases it: "In other words, Christianity strictly is still illicit,
though in particular cases not to be punished as severely as hereto
fore; and the emperor, though forced for the present not to require
you to persecute, will expect you not to relax your exertions more
than can be helped." Mason justly emphasizes in the same connec
tion the use of the words un trpoo maet v in the last clause, which do
not mean non licere ("it is not permitted ") as Valesius, followed
by many others, render them, but "it is not necessary," "they
need not."
It is plain that Maximin made his concessions very un
willingly and only because compelled to; and it is clear that he
suppressed the edict of Galerius, and substituted general and not
wholly unambiguous directions of his own, in order that as little as
ossible might be done for the Christians, and that he might be left
ree for a future time when he should find himself in a more inde
!. position; he evidently did not care to compromise and
amper himself by officially sanctioning the full and explicit tolera:
tion accorded in the edict of Galerius.

Maximin's attitude in the matter, see Mason, p. 399 sq. As he

the

thorough hater of the good and an enemy of
every virtuous person, as he was, could no longer
bear this ; and indeed he did not permit matters
to go on in this way quite six months."
Devis
ing all possible means of destroying the peace,
he first attempted to restrain us, under a pre
text," from meeting in
cemeteries.
Then through the agency of some wicked
men he sent an embassy to himself against
us," inciting the citizens of Antioch to ask from
him as a very great favor that he would by no
means permit any of the Christians to dwell in
their country; and others were secretly induced
to do the same thing. The author of all this in
Antioch was Theotecnus," a violent and wicked
man, who was an impostor, and whose character
was foreign to his name." He appears to have
been the curator" of the city.

1 The Edict of Galerius was issued in April, 311 (see Lactantius,
de Mort. Aers. 35, and Bk. VIII. chap. 17, note 1, above), so that
Maximin's change of policy, recorded in this chapter, must have
begun in October, or thereabouts. Valesius supposes that the death
of Galerius was the cause of Maximin's return to persecuting meas
ures.
But Galerius died, not some months after the issue of the
edict, as Valesius, and others after him, assert, but within a few
days after it, as is directly stated by Lactantius (ibid.), whose ac
curacy in this case there is no reason to question.
Another mis
statement made by Walesius in the same connection, and repeated
by Heinichen, Cruse, and others, is that Maximin became Augustus
only after the death of Galerius. The truth, is, he was recognized
as an Augustus in 308 (see Lactantius, ibid. chap. 32; and Bk. VIII.
chap. 13, note 22, above). The cause of the renewal of the persecu
tion seems to have been simply impatience at the exultation of the
Church and at the wonderful recuperative power revealed the moment
the pressure was taken off. #. it was not renewed sooner was
doubtless due to the more important matters, which engaged the
attention of Maximinus immediately after the death of Galerius, in
connection with the division of the Eastern Empire between himself
and Licinius (see Lactantius, ibid. chap. 36).
It would seem srom
the passage just referred to, that as soon as these matters were satis
factorily adjusted, Maximin turned his attention again to the Chris
tians, and began to curtail their liberty.
* Very likely under the pretext that night gatherings at the
tombs of the martyrs, with M. excitement and enthusiasm neces
sarily engendered under such circumstances, were of immoral ten
dency. §. the honor shown by the Christians to their
fellows who had been put to death at the command of the state was
looked upon as an insult to the authorities, and could not but be very
distasteful to them. They imagined that such meetings would only
tend to foster discontent and disloyalty on the part of those who en
gaged in them, and consequently they were always suspicious of .
them.

* The same account is given by Lactantius, ibid. chap. 36
("First of all he took away the toleration and general protection
granted by Galerius to the *Hi!. and, for this end, he secretly
procured addresses for the different cities, requesting that no Chris
tian church might be built within their walls; and thus he meant to
make that .. was his own choice appear as is extorted from him by
importunity"). It is possible that the account is correct, but it is more
probable that the embassies were genuine, and were voluntarily sent
to the emperor, while he was on a tour through his dominions, by the
pagan population of some of the cities who knew the emperor's own
osition in the matter, and desired to conciliate him and secure
}. from him.
Of course such deputations would delight him
greatly; and what one city did, others would feel compelled to do
also, in order not to seem behindhand in religious zeal and in order
not to run the risk of offending the emperor, who since the death of

The Newly Erected Statue at Antioch.

AFTER this man had carried on all kinds of
war against us and had caused our people to be
diligently hunted up in their retreats, as if they
were unholy thieves, and had devised every sort
of slander and accusation against us, and become
the cause of death to vast numbers, he finally
erected a statue of Jupiter Philius' with certain
juggleries and magic rites. And after inventing
unholy forms of initiation and ill-omened myster
ies in connection with it, and abominable means
of purification," he exhibited his jugglery, by
oracles which he pretended to utter, even to
the emperor; and through a flattery which was
pleasing to the ruler he aroused the demon
against the Christians and said that the god had
given command to expel the Christians as his
enemies beyond the confines of the city and the
neighboring districts.

THE fact that this man, who took the
lead in this matter, had succeeded in his
purpose was an incitement to all the other

And
the governors of the provinces perceiving that
this was agreeable to the emperor suggested to
their subjects that they should do the same.
And as the tyrant by a rescript declared
himself well pleased with their measures,"
persecution was kindled anew against us.

* Lactantius (off. chap. 36) says: "In compliance with those
addresses he [Maximinus] introduced a new mode of government
in things respecting religion, and for each city he created a high
priest, chosen from among the persons of most distinction. The
office of those men was to make daily sacrifices to all their gods,
and, with the aid of the former priests, to prevent the Christians
srom erecting churches, or from worshiping God, either publicly or
in private; and he authorized them to compel the Christians to sac:
rifice to idols, and, on their refusal, to bring them before the civil
magistrate; and, as if this had not been enough, in every province
he established a superintendent priest, one of chief eminence in the
state; and he commanded that all those priests newly instituted
should appear in white habits, that being the most honorable dis
tinction of dress.". Maximin perceived the power that existed in
the Catholic Church with its wonderful organization, and conceived
the stupendous idea of rejuvenating paganism by creating a pagan
Catholic Church. The Roman religion should cease to be the loose,
unorganized, chaotic thing it had always been, and should be made

with great zeal for the service of those whom
they worshiped.
Indeed, the extraordinary
superstition of the emperor, to speak in brief,
led all his subjects, both rulers and private citi
zens, for the sake of gratifying him, to do every
thing against us, supposing that they could best
show their gratitude to him for the benefits which
they had received from him, by plotting murder
against us and exhibiting toward us any new
signs of malignity.

The Forged Acts.

HAVING therefore forged Acts of Pilate |
and our Saviour full of every kind of blas
phemy against Christ, they sent them with the
emperor's approval to the whole of the empire
subject to him, with written commands that they
should be openly posted to the view of all in
every place, both in country and city, and that
the schoolmasters should give them to their
scholars, instead of their customary lessons,
to be studied and learned by heart. While
these things were taking place, another
military commander, whom the Romans call
Dux," seized some infamous women in the mar

threatening to inflict tortures upon them com

regular organization and placing the entire institution in the hands
ofi. and able men, whose business it should be to increase
its stability and power in every way and in all quarters. We are
compelled to admire the wisdom of Maximin's plan. No persecutor
before him had ever seen the need of thus replacing the Christian
Church by another institution as great and as splendid as itself.
The effort, like that of Julian a half-century later, must remain
memorable in the annals of the conflict of paganism with Chris
tlanity.

They
cannot have been very skillful forgeries, for Eusebius, in Bk. I. chap.
9, above, points out a palpable chronological blunder which stamped
them as fictitious on their very face. And yet they doubtless an
swered every purpose; for few of the heathen would be in a position
to detect such an error, and perhaps fewer still would care to expose
it if they discovered it. These Acts are of course to be distinguished
from the numerous Acta Zoroat; which proceeded from Christian
sources (see above, Bk. II. chap. 2, note 1). The way in which
these Acts were employed was diabolical in its very shrewdness.
Certainly there was no more effectual way of checking the spread of
Christianity than systematically, and persistently to train up the
outh of the empire to look with contempt, and disgust upon the
ounder of Christianity, the Christian's Saviour and Lord. Incal.
culable mischief must inevitably have been produced had Maximin's
reign lasted for a number of years. As it was, we can imagine the
horror of the Christians at this new and sacrilegious artifice of the
enemy.

masterstroke" to Theotecnus, but I am unable to find any proof that

nor improbable that he was; but had Eusebius known him to be the
author, he would certainly have informed us. As it
is, his state

connection with Theotecnus.

never been followed elsewhere. The children

names of Jesus and Pilate, and the Acts which

It appears to me necessary to insert here
this document of Maximinus which was
posted on pillars, in order that there may be
made manifest at the same time the boastful and
haughty arrogance of the God-hating man, and
the sleepless evil-hating divine vengeance upon

under whose pressure he not long afterward took
the opposite course in respect to us and con

in the sense of "not long afterward." The single exception occurs
in Bk. IV. chap. 7, § 12, where the phrase is clearly used with the
other meaning - "not for long."
In view of this preponderance of
instances for the former use of the phrase in this single work, it seems
best in the present case-the only doubtful one, so far as I am aware
- to follow Valesius, Stroth, and Closs in translating "not long

it was known to every one how much regard
and reverence you were paying to the immortal
gods, exhibiting not a faith of bare and empty
words, but continued and wonderful exam

given you this saving mind on account of

your faith and piety.

"Accordingly that supreme and mightiest
Jove, who presides over your illustrious city, who
preserves your ancestral gods, your wives and
children, your hearths and homes from every
destructive pest, has infused into your souls this
wholesome resolve ; showing and proving how
excellent and glorious and salutary it is to ob
serve with the becoming reverence the worship
and sacred rites of the immortal gods.
For who can be found so ignorant or so
devoid of all understanding as not to per
ceive that it is due to the kindly care of the gods
that the earth does not refuse the seed sown in it,
nor disappoint the hope of the husbandmen with
vain expectation; that impious war is not inevita
bly fixed upon earth, and wasted bodies dragged
down to death under the influence of a corrupted
atmosphere; that the sea is not swollen and raised
on high by blasts of intemperate winds; that
unexpected hurricanes do not burst forth and
stir up the destructive tempest; moreover, that
the earth, the nourisher and mother of all, is not
shaken from its lowest depths with a terrible
tremor, and that the mountains upon it do not
sink into the opening chasms. No one is ig
norant that all these, and evils still worse than
these, have oftentimes happened hitherto.
And all these misfortunes have taken place
on account of the destructive error of the
empty vanity of those impious men, when it
prevailed in their souls, and, we may almost say,
weighed down the whole world with shame."
After other words he adds: "Let them look
at the standing crops already flourishing

with waving heads in the broad fields, and at the
meadows glittering with plants and flowers, in
response to abundant rains and the restored
mildness and softness of the atmosphere.
Finally, let all rejoice that the might of the
most powerful and terrible Mars has been
propitiated by our piety, our sacrifices, and our
veneration; and let them on this account enjoy
firm and tranquil peace and quiet; and let as
many as have wholly abandoned that blind error
and delusion and have returned to a right and
sound mind rejoice the more, as those who have
been rescued from an unexpected storm or
severe disease and are to reap the fruits of
pleasure for the rest of their life.
But if
they still persist in their execrable vanity, let
them, as you have desired, be driven far away
from your city and territory, that thus, in accord
ance with your praiseworthy zeal in this matter,
your city, being freed from every pollution and
impiety, may, according to its native disposition,
attend to the sacred rites of the immortal
gods with becoming reverence. But that ye
may know how acceptable to us your request
respecting this matter has been, and how ready
our mind is to confer benefits voluntarily, with
out memorials and petitions, we permit your de
votion to ask whatever great gift ye may desire
in return for this your pious disposition.
And now ask that this may be done and
that ye may receive it; for ye shall obtain
it without delay.
This, being granted to your
city, shall furnish for all time an evidence of
reverent piety toward the immortal gods, and
of the fact that you have obtained from our
benevolence merited prizes for this choice of
yours; and it shall be shown to your children
and children's children."

This was published against us in all the
provinces, deprivingus of every hope of good,
at least from men; so that, according to that
divine utterance, "If it were possible, even the
elect would have stumbled" at these things.
And now indeed, when the hope of most of
us was almost extinct, suddenly while those
who were to execute against us the above decree
had in some places scarcely finished their jour
ney, God, the defender of his own Church, ex
hibited his heavenly interposition in our behalf,
well-nigh stopping the tyrant's boasting against

abundance upon the earth and an unexpected
famine made its appearance, and in addition to
this a pestilence, and another severe disease
consisting of an ulcer, which on account of its
fiery appearance was appropriately called a car
buncle."
This, spreading over the whole body,
greatly endangered the lives of those who suf
fered from it; but as it chiefly attacked the
eyes, it deprived multitudes of men, women,
and children of their sight.
In addition to
this the tyrant was compelled to go to war
with the Armenians, who had been from ancient
times friends and allies of the Romans. As they
were also Christians" and zealous in their piety
toward the Deity, the enemy of God had at
tempted to compel them to sacrifice to idols
and demons, and had thus made friends
foes, and allies enemies.
All these things
suddenly took place at one and the same

tyrant's empty vaunt
time, and refuted
against the Deity.
For he had boasted that,
because of his zeal for idols and his hostility
against us, neither famine nor pestilence nor

therefore, coming upon him at once and to
gether, furnished a prelude also of his own
destruction. He himself with his forces
was defeated in the war with the Armenians,
and the rest of the inhabitants of the cities
under him were terribly afflicted with fanline
and pestilence, so that one measure of wheat
was sold
for twenty-five hundred Attic
drachms." Those who died in the cities
were innumerable, and those who died in
the country and villages were still more. So

rural population were almost entirely wiped
out; nearly all being speedily destroyed by fam

Eusebius is the only writer to tell
us of this famine, and pestilence during Maximin's reign, though
Lactantius (De Mort. Aers. 37) does refer in a single sentence to a
famine, without giving us any particulars in regard to it, or informing
us of its severity or extent.
* We do not know when Christianity was first preached in Ar
menia, but late in the third century Gregory, "the so..." an
Armenian of royal blood who had received a Christian training in
Cappadocia, returned as a missionary to his native land, which was
mainly heathen, and at the beginning of the fourth century succeeded
in converting the king, Tiridates III., and a large number of the
nobles and people, and Christianity was established as the state
religion (see the articles Armenia and Gregory, the Illuminator, in
the />ict. of Christ. Bros.).

The Armenians had been friends of the Romans for many genera
tions and allies in their wars with the Persians on many occasions.
The present war is mentioned, so far as I know, only by Eusebius.
According to § 4, below, it ended in a defeat for Maximinus.
It
cannot have been a war of great consequence.
It was very likely
little more than a temporary misunderstanding, resulting perhaps in
a few skirmishes between troops on the border, and speedily settled
by a treaty of some kind or another. Maximinus at any rate could
not afford to quarrel long with his Eastern neighbors, in view of the
struggle with Licinius which he knew must come in time. Whether
the Armenians or the Romans were the aggressors in this affair,
Eusebius does not tell us.
It is very probable, as Mason suggests,
that Maximinus tried to put down Christianity in Lesser Armenia,
which was a Roman province and therefore under his sway, and
that their brethren in the kingdom of Armenia took up arms against
Rome to avenge their kindred and their faith.

ine and pestilence.
Some, therefore, desired to dispose of their most precious
things to those who were better supplied, in
return for the smallest morsel of food, and
others, selling their possessions little by little,
fell into the last extremity of want.
Some,
chewing wisps of hay and recklessly eating nox
ious herbs, undermined and ruined their
constitutions. And some of the high-born
women in the cities, driven by want to
shameful extremities, went forth into the market
places to beg, giving evidence of their former
liberal culture by the modesty of their appear
ance and the decency of their apparel.
Some, wasted away like ghosts and at the
very point of death, stumbled and tottered
here and there, and too weak to stand fell down
in the middle of the streets; lying stretched
out at full length they begged that a small
morsel of food might be given them, and with
their last gasp they cried out Hunger
having
strength only for this most painful cry.
But others, who seemed to be better supplied, astonished at the multitude of the
beggars,
giving away large quantities,
finally became hard and relentless, expecting
that they themselves also would soon suffer the
same calamities as those who begged.
So that
in the midst of the market-places and lanes,
dead and naked bodies lay unburied for many
days, presenting the most lamentable spec
tacle to those that beheld them.
Some
also became food for dogs, on which ac
count the survivors began to kill the dogs, lest
they should become mad and should go to
devouring men.

But still worse was the pestilence which
consumed entire houses and families, and
especially those whom the famine was not able
to destroy because of their abundance of food.
Thus men of wealth, rulers and governors and
multitudes in office, as if left by the famine on
purpose for the pestilence, suffered swift and
speedy death.
Every place therefore was full of
lamentation; in every lane and market-place and
street there was nothing else to be seen or
heard than tears, with the customary instru
ments and the voices of the mourners."
In
this way death, waging war with these two
weapons, pestilence and famine, destroyed whole
families in a short time, so that one could see
two or three dead bodies carried out at
once.
Such were the rewards of the boast
ing of Maximinus and of the measures of
the cities against us.

and piety of the Christians become manifest
to all the heathen.

and humanity by their deeds.
Every day some
continued caring for and burying the dead, for
there were multitudes who had no one to care
for them ; others collected in one place those
who were afflicted by the famine, throughout the
entire city, and gave bread to them all; so that
the thing became noised abroad among all men,
and they glorified the God of the Christians;
and, convinced by the facts themselves, con
sessed that they alone were truly pious and
religious. After these things were thus done,
God, the great and celestial defender of the
Christians, having revealed in the events which
have been described his anger and indignation
at all men for the great evils which they had
brought upon us, restored to us the bright and
gracious sunlight of his providence in our behalf;
so that in the deepest darkness a light of peace
shone most wonderfully upon us from him, and
made it manifest to all that God himself has
always been the ruler of our affairs.
From time
to time indeed he chastens his people and cor
rects them by his visitations, but again after
sufficient chastisement he shows mercy and favor
to those who hope in him.

CHAPTER IX.

The Victory of the God-Beloved Emperors."

THUS when Constantine, whom we have
already mentioned" as an emperor, born of
an emperor, a pious son of a most pious and
prudent father, and Licinius, second to him," -
two God-beloved emperors, honored alike for
their intelligence and their piety, - being stirred
up against the two most impious tyrants by God,
the absolute Ruler and Saviour of all, engaged
in formal war against them, with God as their
ally, Maxentius" was defeated at Rome by Con
stantine in a remarkable manner, and the tyrant
of the East" did not long survive him, but met
a most shameful death at the hand of Licin

1 All the MSS., followed by Walesius and Cruse, give this as the
title of the next chapter, and give as the title of this chapter the one
which I have placed at the head of chapter 10.
It is plain enough
from the contents of the two chapters that the titles have in some
way become transposed in the MSS., and so they are restored to
their proper position by the majority of the editors, whom I have
followed.

* See above, Bk. VIII. chap. 13.
* On Licinius, see thid. note 21.

Constantine and Licinius were
both Augusti, and thus nominally, of equal rank.
Nevertheless,
both in the edict of Galerius, quoted in Bk. VIII. chap. 17, and in
the edict of Milan, given in full in the Pe Mart. Aers, chap. 48,
Constantine's name precedes that of Licinius, showing that he was
regarded as in some sense the latter's senior, and thus confirming
Eusebius' statement, the truth of which Closs unnecessarily denies.
It seems a little peculiar that Constantine should thus be recognized
as Licinius' senior, especially in the edict of Galerius; for although
it is true that he had been a Caesar some time before Licinius had
been admitted to the imperial college, yet, on the other hand,
Licinius was made Augustus by Galerius before Constantine was,

efeat by Licinius and

ius, who had not yet become insane." Constantine, who was the superior both in dig
nity and imperial rank," first took compassion
upon those who were oppressed at Rome, and
having invoked in prayer the God of heaven,
and his Word, and Jesus Christ himself, the
Saviour of all, as his aid, advanced with his whole
army, proposing to restore to the Romans
their ancestral liberty.
But Maxentius, putting confidence rather in the arts of sorcery
than in the devotion of his subjects, did not dare
to go forth beyond the gates of the city, but for.
tified every place and district and town which
was enslaved by him, in the neighborhood of
Rome and in all Italy, with an immense multi
tude of troops and with innumerable bands of
soldiers.
But the emperor, relying upon the as
sistance of God, attacked the first, second, and
third army of the tyrant, and conquered them
all ; and having advanced through the greater
part of Italy, was already very near Rome.
Then, that he might not be compelled to
wage war with the Romans for the sake of
the tyrant, God himself drew the latter, as if
bound in chains, some distance without the gates,
and confirmed those threats against the impious
which had been anciently inscribed in sacred
books, - disbelieved, indeed, by most as a myth,
but believed by the faithful, - confirmed them,
in a word, by the deed itself to all, both believ
ers and unbelievers, that saw the wonder
with their eyes.
Thus, as in the time of
Moses himself and of the ancient God
beloved race of Hebrews, "he cast Pharaoh's
chariots and host into the sea, and overwhelmed
his chosen charioteers in the Red Sea, and cov
ered them with the flood," in the same way
Maxentius also with his soldiers and body-guards
"went down into the depths like a stone," when
he fled before the power of God which was with
Constantine, and passed through the river which
lay in his way, over which he had formed a

* of no uqvovros Táre. This refers to Licinius' hostility to the
Christians, which made its appearance some years later, and re
sulted in a persecution (see below, Bk. X. chap. 8). The clause,
if a part of the original, obliges us to suppose that the ninth book
was composed after Licinius had begun to persecute, but there are
strong reasons for thinking that the first nine books were completed
before 314 (sce above, p. 45); indeed, we cannot explain Eusebius'
eulogistic words in speaking of Licinius here and elsewhere in this
book on any other ground.
It seems necessary, therefore, to regard
this clause and the similar clause in § 12, below, as later insertions,
made possibly at the time of the addition of the tenth book (see p. 45).

means of his own destruction.
In regard
to him one might say, "he digged a pit and
opened it and fell into the hole which he had
made ; his labor shall turn upon his own head,
and his unrighteousness shall fall upon his
own crown."" Thus, then, the bridge over
the river being broken, the passageway set
tled down, and immediately the boats with the
men disappeared in the depths, and that most
impious one himself first of all, then the shield
bearers who were with him, as the divine oracles
foretold, "sank like lead in the mighty
waters";" so that those who obtained the
victory from God, if not in words, at least
in deeds, like Moses, the great servant of God,
and those who were with him, fittingly sang as
they had sung against the impious tyrant of old,
saying, "Let us sing unto the Lord, for he hath
gloriously glorified himself; horse and rider
hath he thrown into the sea; a helper and a
protector hath he become for my salvation; ""
and "Who is like unto thee, O Lord ; among the
gods, who is like unto thee? glorious in holi
ness," marvelous in glory, doing wonders.""

his very deeds, sang to God, the universal

But he, as one possessed of inborn piety
toward God, did not exult in the shouts, nor
was he elated by the praises; but perceiving
that his aid was from God, he immediately com
manded that a trophy of the Saviour's passion

he had placed it, with the saving sign of the
cross in its right hand, in the most public place
in Rome, he commanded that the following in

Roman tongue: "By this salutary sign, the

himself and with him the Emperor Licinius,
who had not yet been seized by that madness
into which he later fell," praising God as the
author of all their blessings, with one will and
mind drew up a full and most complete decree
in behalf of the Christians," and sent an account
of the wonderful things done for them by God,
and of the victory over the tyrant, together with
a copy of the decree itself, to Maximinus, who
still ruled over the nations of the East and
pretended friendship toward them.
But he,
like a tyrant, was greatly pained by what he
learned ; but not wishing to seem to yield to others,
nor, on the other hand, to suppress that which
was commanded, for fear of those who enjoined
it, as if on his own authority, he addressed, under
compulsion, to the governors under him this
first communication in behalf of the Christians,"
falsely inventing things against himself which had
never been done by him.

odio; upon the receipt of the edict of Constantine and Licinius.
As Mason remarks, his reasons for writing this epistle can hardly
have been fear of Constantine and Licinius, as Fusebius states, for
he was bent upon war against them, and attacked Licinius at the
earliest possible moment. He cannot have cared, therefore, to take
any special pains to conciliate them. He was probably moved by a
desire to conciliate, just at this crisis, the numerous and influential
body of his subjects whom he had persecuted, in order that he might
not have to contend with disaffection and disloyalty within his own
dominions during his impending conflict with Licinius. The docu
ment itself is a most peculiar one, full of false statements and con
tradictions.
Mason well says: "In this curious letter Maximin
contradicts himself often enough to make his Christian subjects
dizzy,
First he justifies bloody persecution, then plumes himself
upon having stopped it, next apologizes for having set it again on foot,
then denies that it was going on, and lastly orders it to cease. We
cannot wonder at what Eusebius relates, that the people whose
wrongs the letter applauded and forbade, neither built church nor
held meeting in public on the strength of it; they did not know
where to have it."

MAXIMIN'S GRANT OF PARTIAL TOLERATION.

East under favorable auspices and learned that
in some places a great many men who were
able to render public service had been banished
by the judges for the above-mentioned cause, I
gave command to each of the judges that hence
forth none of them should treat the provincials
with severity, but that they should rather recall
them to the worship of the gods by flattery
and exhortations." Then when, in accord
ance with my command, these orders were
obeyed by the judges, it came to pass that none
of those who lived in the districts of the East
were banished or insulted, but that they were
rather brought back to the worship of the gods
by the fact that no severity was employed
toward them.
But afterwards, when I went
up last year * under good auspices to Nico
media and sojourned there, citizens of the same
city came to me with the images of the gods,
earnestly entreating that such a people should
by no means be permitted to dwell in their
country."
But when I learned that many
men of the same religion dwelt in those re
gions, I replied that I gladly thanked them for
their request, but that I perceived that it was
not proffered by all, and that if, therefore, there
were any that persevered in the same supersti
tion, each one had the privilege of doing as he
pleased, even if he wished to recognize the
worship of the gods."
Nevertheless, I con
sidered it necessary to give a friendly an
swer to the inhabitants of Nicomedia and to the
other cities which had so earnestly presented to
me the same petition, namely, that no Christians
should dwell in their cities, - both because this
same course had been pursued by all the ancient
emperors, and also because it was pleasing to
the gods, through whom all men and the gov
ernment of the state itself endure, - and to
confirm the request which they presented in
behalf of the worship of their deity. There

ters have been sent to thy devotedness, and

the care of the gods.

of his own choice should decide to adopt

should be welcomed, but if any should wish to
follow their own religion, do thou leave it in
their power.
Wherefore it behooves thy
devotedness to observe that which is com
mitted to thee, and to see that power is given
to no one to oppress our provincials with in
sults and extortions," since, as already written,
it is fitting to recall our provincials to the wor
ship of the gods rather by exhortations and
flatteries.
But, in order that this command of
ours may come to the knowledge of all our pro
vincials, it is incumbent upon thee to proclaim
that which has been enjoined, in an edict issued
by thyself."

Since he was forced to do this by neces
sity and did not give the command by his
own will, he was not regarded by any one as
sincere or trustworthy, because he had already
shown his unstable and deceitful disposition
after his former similar concession.

of our people, therefore, ventured to hold
meetings or even to appear in public, because
his communication did not cover this, but only
commanded to guard against doing us any in

meetings or build churches or perform any
of our customary acts.

doubtless used to translate the Latin concussio, which in legal lan

aware, that these beneficiari were especially active in thus prac
ticing extortions upon the Christians; but we can gather from Ter
tullian's words in the various passages referred to that the Christians
had to suffer particularly from the soldiers in this respect, and doubt
for they possessed more
less from the beneficiarif most of all;

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[IX. Io.

CHAPTER X.

The Overthrow of the Tyrants and the IWord's
which they uttered before their Death."

this course were the following.

THE circumstances which drove him to
Being no
longer able to sustain the magnitude of the
government which had been undeservedly com
mitted to him, in consequence of his want of
prudence and imperial understanding, he man
aged affairs in a base manner, and with his mind
unreasonably exalted in all things with boastful
pride, even toward his colleagues in the empire
who were in every respect his superiors, in
birth, in training, in education, in worth and in
telligence, and, greatest of all, in temperance
and piety toward the true God, he began to
venture to act audaciously and to arrogate
to himself the first rank."
Becoming mad
in his folly, he broke the treaties which he
had made with Licinius" and undertook an
implacable war. Then in a brief time he threw
all things into confusion, and stirred up every
city, and having collected his entire force, com
prising an immense number of soldiers, he went
forth to battle with him, elated by his hopes in
demons, whom he supposed to be gods, and
by the number of his soldiers. And when
he joined battle" he was deprived of the
oversight of God, and the victory was given to
Licinius," who was then ruling, by the one

which he trusted was destroyed, and as all
his guards abandoned him and left him alone,
and fled to the victor, he secretly divested him
self as quickly as possible of the imperial gar
ments, which did not fitly belong to him, and in
a cowardly and ignoble and unmanly way min
gled with the crowd, and then fled, concealing
himself in fields and villages."
But though he
was so careful for his safety, he scarcely escaped
the hands of his enemies, revealing by his deeds

* On the transposition of the titles of chaps. 9 and Io, see the

previous chapter, note 1.

* That Maximin should arrogate to himself, as Eusebius says,
the highest rank is not very surprising, when we realize that that
position, in so far as any difference in rank between the different
rulers was acknowledged, belonged to him by right, inasmuch as
he was Constantine's senior (having been first Caesar when the lat
ter was only second), while Constantine (see above, chap. 9, note 2)
was regarded as the senior of Licinius.

* The treaty made in 311, just after the death of Galerius (see De

mort. Aers. 36).

* This battle between Licinius and Maximin was fought on April
30, 313, at Adrianople, in Thrace. For a more detailed but somewhat
imaginative account of the battle, see De mort. Aers, chap. 45 sq.
Lactantius is considerate enough to accord Licinius the honor of a
divine vision, that he may not be behind his imperial colleague Con
stantine; and he is pious enough to ascribe the victory wholly to the
divine aid vouchsased in response to the prayers of Licinius and his
soldiers.

* The word Licinius is omitted by Laemmer and Heinichen, but

without sufficient warrant, for it is found in nearly all the MSS.
" Lactantius (roid, chap. 47) informs us that Maximin's flight
was so rapid that he reached Šic. which was 160 miles from
Adrianople, on the evening of the day following the battle.
As
Gibbon remarks, "The incredible speed which Maximin exerted in
his flight is much more celebrated than his prowess in battle,"

that the divine oracles are faithful and true,
in which it is said, "A king is not saved by
a great force, and a giant shall not be saved
by the greatness of his strength; a horse is a
vain thing for safety, nor shall he be delivered
by the greatness of his power. Behold, the eyes
of the Lord are upon them that fear him, upon
them that hope in his mercy, to deliver
their souls from death."
Thus the tyrant, covered with shame, went to his own
country. And first, in
frantic rage, he slew
many priests and prophets of the gods whom
he had formerly admired, and whose oracles had
incited him to undertake the war, as sorcerers
and impostors, and besides all as betrayers of
his safety. Then having given glory to the God
of the Christians and enacted a most full and
complete ordinance in behalf of their liberty,"
he was immediately seized with a mortal disease,
and no respite being granted him, departed this
life." The law enacted by him was as follows:

"The Emperor Caesar Caius Valerius Maximi

tus, Augustus. We believe it manifest that no
one is ignorant, but that every man who looks
back over the past knows and is conscious that
in every way we care continually for the good of
our provincials, and wish to furnish them with
those things which are of especial advantage to
all, and for the common benefit and profit, and
whatever contributes to the public welfare
and is agreeable to the views of each. When,
therefore, before this, it became clear to our
mind that under pretext of the command of our
parents, the most divine Diocletian and Maxi
mianus, which enjoined that the meetings of the

were to oppose Licinius successfully, he must secure the loyalty of
all his subjects, and this could be done only by granting the Chris
tians full toleration. He could see plainly enough that Licinius'
religious policy was a success in securing the allegiance of his sub
jects, ...]". found himself compelled in . to pursue a
similar course, distasteful as it was to him. There is no sign that
he had any other motive in taking this step.
Religious considera
tions seem to have had nothing to do with it; he was doubtless as
much of a pagan as ever. The edict itself is composed in an admi
rable vein. As Mason remarks, "Maximin made the concession with
so much dignity and grace, that it is impossible to help wishing that
his language were truer." As in the previous decree, he indulges
his passion for lying without restraint; but, unlike that one, the
present edict is straightforward and consistent throughout, and grants
the Christians sull liberty in the most unequivocal terms.

* Maximin's death took place at Tarsus (according to De mort.
Aers. chap. 49), and apparently within a few weeks after his defeat
at Adrianople and the publication of his edict of toleration. The
reports of his death are somewhat conflicting.
Zosimus and the
epitomist of Victor say merely that he died a natural death; Lac
tantius tells us that i. took poison; while Eusebius in § 14 sq.
gives us a horrible account of his last sickness which, according to
him, was marked, to say the least, with some rather remarkable
symptoms. Mason facetiously remarks that Eusebius seems to be

DEATH OF MAXIMIN.

Christians should be abolished, many extortions"
and spoliations had been practiced by offi
cials; and that those evils were continually in
creasing, to the detriment of our provincials,
toward whom we are especially anxious to exer
cise proper care, and that their possessions
were in consequence perishing, letters were sent
last year" to the governors of each province, in
which we decreed that, if any one wished to fol
low such a practice or to observe this same re
ligion, he should be permitted without hindrance
to pursue his purpose and should be impeded
and prevented by no one, and that all should
have liberty to do without any fear or suspi
cion that which each preferred.
But even
now we cannot help perceiving that some
of the judges have mistaken our commands, and
have given our people reason to doubt the mean
ing of our ordinances, and have caused them to
proceed too reluctantly to the observance of
those religious rites which are pleasing to
them.
In order, therefore, that in the fu
ture every suspicion of fearful doubt may be
taken away, we have commanded that this decree
be published, so that it may be clear to all that
whoever wishes to embrace this sect and religion
is permitted to do so by virtue of this grant of
ours; and that each one, as he wishes or as is
pleasing to him, is permitted to practice this re
ligion which he has chosen to observe according

build Lord's houses.
But that this grant of
ours may be the greater, we have thought
good to decree also that if any houses and lands
before this time rightfully belonged to the Chris
tians, and by the command of our parents fell
into the treasury, or were confiscated by any
city, - whether they have been sold or presented
to any one as a gift, - that all these should be
restored to their original possessors, the Chris
tians, in order that in this also every one may
have knowledge of our piety and care."

ll

These are the words of the tyrant which
were published not quite a year after the
decrees against the Christians engraved by him
on pillars."
And by him to whom a little
before we seemed impious wretches and atheists
and destroyers of all life, so that we were not
permitted to dwell in any city nor even in coun
try or desert, - by him decrees and ordinances
were issued in behalf of the Christians, and they

of the persecutors, but in the present case exaggeration is hardly
necessary, for it would seem from Lactantius' account, that he died
not of poison, as he states, but of delirium tremens. As Mason
remarks, "It is probable that Maximin died of nothing worse than
a natural death.
But the death which was natural to him was the
most dreadful perhaps that men can die. Maximin was known as an
habitual drunkard; and in his dying delirium he is said to have cried
out that he saw God, with assessors, all in white robes, judging

im."

who recently had been destroyed by fire and
sword, by wild beasts and birds of prey, in the
presence of the tyrant himself, and had suffered
every species of torture and punishment, and
most miserable deaths as atheists and impious
wretches, were now acknowledged by him as
possessors of religion and were permitted to
build churches; and the tyrant himself bore
witness and confessed that they had some
rights. And having made such confessions,
as if he had received some benefit on ac
count of them, he suffered perhaps less than he
ought to have suffered, and being smitten by a
sudden scourge of God, he perished in the
second campaign of the war.
But his end
was not like that of military chieftains who,
while fighting bravely -in battle for virtue and
friends, often boldly encounter a glorious death;
for like an impious enemy of God, while his
army was still drawn up in the field, remaining
at home and concealing himself, he suffered the
punishment which he deserved.
For he was
smitten with a sudden scourge of God in his
whole body, and harassed by terrible pains and
torments, he fell prostrate on the ground, wasted
by hunger, while all his flesh was dissolved by
an invisible and God-sent fire, so that the whole
appearance of his frame was changed, and there
was left only a kind of image wasted away by
length of time to a skeleton of dry bones; so
that those who were present could think of his
body as nothing else than the tomb of his soul,
which was buried in a body already dead
and completely melted away. And as the
heat still more violently consumed him in
the depths of his marrow, his eyes burst forth,
and falling from their sockets left him blind.
Thereupon still breathing and making free con
fession to the Lord, he invoked death, and at
last, after acknowledging that he justly suffered
these things on account of his violence against
Christ, he gave up the ghost.

The Fina/ Destruction of the Enemies of

THUS when Maximinus, who alone had

had appeared the worst of them all, was put out
of the way, the renovation of the churches from
their foundations was begun by the grace of

above, chap. 9, note 7), and Diocletian early in 313 (see Bk. VIII.
App. note 3).

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

[IX. 11.

while the impious enemies of religion were cov
ered with extremest shame and dishonor.
For Maximinus himself, being first pro
nounced by the emperors a common en
emy, was declared by public proclamations to be
a most impious, execrable, and God-hating ty
rant. And of the portraits which had been set up
in every city in honor of him or of his children,
some were thrown down from their places to the
ground, and torn in pieces; while the faces of oth
ers were obliterated by daubing them with black
paint. And the statues which had been erected
to his honor were likewise overthrown and
broken, and lay exposed to the laughter and
sport of those who wished to insult and
abuse them. Then also all the honors of
the other enemies of religion were taken
away, and all those who sided with Maximinus
were slain, especially those who had been hon
ored by him with high offices in reward for their
flattery, and had behaved insolently toward
our doctrine.
Such an one was Peucetius,"
the dearest of his companions, who had
been honored and rewarded by him above all,
who had been consul a second and third time,
and had been appointed by him chief minister;"
and Culcianus," who had likewise advanced
through every grade of office, and was also cel
ebrated for his numberless executions of Chris
tians in Egypt;" and besides these not a few
others, by whose agency especially the tyranny
of Maximinus had been confirmed and ex
And Theotecnus" also was sum
tended.

* Of this Peucetius (Rufinus Peucedius) we know only what is
told us here.
Walesius says: "The name is to be rendered Picen
tius, a name which was borne by a certain calumniator in the time
of Constantine, as is stated by Zosimus at the end of his second
book.
The Latins, indeed, call them Picentes whom the Greeks
call IIvrerious."
* tav Ka86Aov Adywy, orapxos, apparently equivalent to the
phrase ori riov Ka86Aov Adywy, used in Bk. §. chap. 19, § 5. On
its significance, see the note on that passage, and cf. Valesius' note
ad locum.

* This same Culcianus appears in the Acts of St. Phileas of
Th"nuis (Ruinart, p. 434 sq.; see the extract printed in Mason, p.
292 sq.) as the magistrate or governor under whom Phileas suffered
in Thebais. He is doubtless to be identified, as Walesius remarks,
with..Quleianus (Kovantarós) mentioned by Epiphanius (Haer.
LXVIII. 1) as governor of Thebais at the time | the rise of the
Meletian schism, while Hierocles was governor of Alexandria.
o Culcianus seems to have been governor of Thebais (where
Phileas suffered, according to Bk. vío. chap. 9), not of Egypt.
Possibly Eusebius employs the word Egypt in its general sense, as
including Thebais.

statue had been set up by him at Antioch, he
appeared to be in the happiest state, and was
already made a governor by Maximinus.
But Licinius, coming down to the city of
Antioch, made a search for impostors, and
tortured the prophets and priests of the newly
erected statue, asking them for what reason they
practiced their deception.
They, under the
stress of torture, were unable longer to conceal
the matter, and declared that the whole decep
tive mystery had been devised by the art of
Theotecnus.
Therefore, after meting out to all
of them just judgment, he first put Theotecnus
himself to death, and then his confederates in
the imposture, with the severest possible
tortures. To all these were added also the
children" of Maximinus, whom he had
already made sharers in the imperial dignity, by
placing their names on tablets and statues. And
the relatives of the tyrant, who before had been
boastful and had in their pride oppressed all
men, suffered the same punishments with those
who have been already mentioned, as well as
the extremest disgrace.
For they had not re
ceived instruction, neither did they know and
understand the exhortation given in the
Holy Word: "Put not your trust in princes, nor in the sons of men, in whom there
is no salvation; his spirit shall go forth and
return to his earth; in that day all their thoughts
perish."

The impious ones having been thus
removed, the government was preserved
firm and undisputed for Constantine and Licin
ius, to whom it fittingly belonged.
They, hav
ing first of all cleansed the world of hostility
to the Divine Being, conscious of the benefits
which he had conferred upon them, showed
their love of virtue and of God, and their piety
and gratitude to the Deity, by their ordinance
in behalf of the Christians."

* See chap. 3.
* Lactantius (De mort. Aers. chap. 50) tells us that Maximin
left a wife and two children, a boy eight years old, named Maximus,
and a daughter seven years old who was betrothed to Candidianus.

THANKS for all things be given unto God
the Omnipotent Ruler and King of the uni
verse, and the greatest thanks to Jesus Christ
the Saviour and Redeemer of our souls, through
whom we pray that peace may be always pre
served for us firm and undisturbed by exter
nal troubles and by troubles of the mind.
Since in accordance with thy wishes, my
most holy Paulinus,' we have added the
tenth book of the Church History to those which
have preceded," we will inscribe it to thee,
proclaiming thee as the seal of the whole
work; and we will fitly add in a perfect
number the perfect panegyric upon the
restoration of the churches," obeying the Divine
Spirit which exhorts us in the following words:

1 Paulinus, bishop of Tyre, became afterward bishop of Antioch,
as we are told by Eusebius, Contra Marcellum, I. 4, and by Philo
storgius, H. E. III. 15.
According to Jerome's Chron., year of
Abr. 2345, he was the successor of Philogonius and the predecessor
of Eustathius in the episcopate of Antioch. He was still alive when
Eusebius completed his History, that is, at least as late as 323 (see
above, p. 45), but he was already dead when the Council of Nicaea
met; for Eustathius was at that time bishop of Antioch (see e.g. So
zomen, H. E. I. 17, Theodoret, H. E. I. 7, and the Acts of the Coun
cil of Nicaea, ed. Labbei et Cossartii, I. p. 51), and Zeno, bishop of
Tyre (see the Acts of the Nicene Council, ibid.).
Philostorgius
(oid.) informs us that he became bishop of Antioch but six months
before his death, and there is no reason to doubt the statement.
Eusebius speaks of him in the highest terms, both here and in his
Contra Marcellum, and it was at the dedication of his church in
Tyre that he delivered the panegyric oration quoted in chap. 4,
below. He is claimed as a sympathizer by Arius in his epistle to
Eusebius of Nicomedia (Theodoret, Af. } I. 5), and that he ac
cepted Arius' tenets is implied by Eusebius of Nicomedia, who,
however, feels obliged to admonish him for not showing greater zeal
in the support of the cause (see this epistle quoted by Theodoret,
A. I. 6).
This is the extent of our information in regard to him.
• On the date of the composition of the tenth book of the History,

and its relation to the earlier books, see above, p. 45.

to the number of the book (the number ten being commonly so
called in ancient times), to which he has referred in the previous

Could we regard the "perfect panegyric" as referring to
the book as a whole, as Cruse does, the sentence would be some

"Sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath
done marvelous things.
His right hand and his
holy arm hath saved him. The Lord hath made
known his salvation, his righteousness hath he
revealed in the presence of the nations." "
And in accordance with the utterance which
commands us to sing the new song, let us
proceed to show that, after those terrible and
gloomy spectacles which we have described," we
are now permitted to see and celebrate such
things as many truly righteous men and martyrs
of God before us desired to see upon earth and
did not see, and to hear and did not hear."
But they, hastening on, obtained far better
things, being carried to heaven and the
paradise of divine pleasure.
But, acknowledg
ing that even these things are greater than we
deserve, we have been astonished at the grace
manifested by the author of the great gifts, and
rightly do we admire him, worshiping him with
the whole power of our souls, and testifying to
the truth of those recorded utterances, in
which it is said, "Come and see the works
of the Lord, the wonders which he hath
done upon the earth; he removeth wars to the
ends of the world, he shall break the bow and
snap the spear in sunder, and shall burn the
shields with fire."
Rejoicing in these things
which have been clearly fulfilled in our day, let
us proceed with our account.

The whole race of God's enemies was
destroyed in the manner indicated," and
was thus suddenly swept from the sight of men.
So that again a divine utterance had its fulfill
ment: "I have seen the impious highly exalted
and raising himself like the cedars of Lebanon ;
and I have passed by, and behold, he was not :
and I have sought his place, and it could
not be found." And finally a bright and
splendid day, overshadowed by no cloud,
illuminated with beams of heavenly light the
churches of Christ throughout the entire world.

upon us by God."

CHAPTER II.

7.he Restoration of the Churches.

All men, then, were freed from the op
pression of the tyrants, and being released
from the former ills, one in one way and another
in another acknowledged the defender of the
pious to be the only true God. And we especially
who placed our hopes in the Christ of God had
unspeakable gladness, and a certain inspired joy
bloomed for all of us, when we saw every place
which shortly before had been desolated by the
impieties of the tyrants reviving as if from a long
and death-fraught pestilence, and temples again
rising from their foundations to an immense
height, and receiving a splendor far greater than
that of the old ones which had been destroyed.
But the supreme rulers also confirmed to us
still more extensively the munificence of God
by repeated ordinances in behalf of the Christians;
and personal letters of the emperor were sent to
the bishops, with honors and gifts of money.
It
may not be unfitting to insert these documents,
translated from the Roman into the Greek tongue,
at the proper place in this book,' as in a sacred
tablet, that they may remain as a memorial to
all who shall come after us.

CHAPTER III.

The Dedications in Every /?ace.

AFTER this was seen the sight which had
been desired and prayed for by us all;
feasts of dedication in the cities and consecra
tions of the newly built houses of prayer took
place, bishops assembled, foreigners came to
gether from abroad, mutual love was exhibited
between people and people, the members of
Christ's body were united in complete har
mony. Then was fulfilled the prophetic
utterance which mystically foretold what was
to take place: "Bone to bone and joint to
joint,"" and whatever was truly announced in
enigmatic expressions in the inspired pas
sage.
And there was one energy of the

* These sentences are excellent examples of Eusebius' rhetorical
style, which marks the greater part of this tenth book. My endeavor
has been to adhere as closely as possible to the oioi, and yet
there are cases in which it is quite out of the question to give a
literal translation without violating all grammatical laws, and in
which the sense can be reproduced only by paraphrasing. The
present sentence runs vai unv kai Tov mpomyovu vow ovre Aets

one soul in all, and the same eagerness of
faith, and one hymn from all in praise of the
Deity.
Yea, and perfect services were conducted
by the prelates, the sacred rites being solem
nized, and the majestic institutions of the Church
observed," here with the singing of psalms and
with the reading of the words committed to us
by God, and there with the performance of
divine and mystic services; and the mysterious
symbols of the Saviour's passion were dis
pensed.
At the same time people of every
age, both male and female, with all the
power of the mind gave honor unto God, the
author of their benefits, in prayers and thanks
giving, with a joyful mind and soul. And every
one of the bishops present, each to the best of
his ability, delivered panegyric orations, adding
luster to the assembly.

CHAPTER IV.

Panegyric on the Splendor of Affairs.

A CERTAIN one of those of moderate talent,' who had composed a discourse, stepped
forward in the presence of many pastors who
were assembled as if for a church gathering,
and while they attended quietly and decently,
he addressed himself as follows to one who was
in all things a most excellent bishop and beloved
of God," through whose zeal the temple in Tyre,
which was the most splendid in Phoenicia, had
been erected.

Panegyric upon she building of the churches,
addressed to Paulinus, Bishop of Zyre.

"Friends and priests of God who are clothed
in the sacred gown and adorned with the heav
enly crown of glory, the inspired unction and
the sacerdotal garment of the Holy Spirit; and
thou," oh pride of God's new holy temple, en
dowed by him with the wisdom of age, and yet
exhibiting costly works and deeds of youthful
and flourishing virtue, to whom God himself,
who embraces the entire world, has granted the
distinguished honor of building and renewing this
earthly house to Christ, his only begotten and
first-born Word, and to his holy and divine
bride;"-one might call thee a new Beseleel,"

or also a new Zerubabel, who added a much
greater glory than the former to the temple
of God;"-and you also, oh nurslings of
the sacred flock of Christ, habitation of
good words, school of wisdom, and august
and pious auditory of religion: " It was long
ago permitted us to raise hymns and songs
to God, when we learned from hearing the Divine
Scriptures read the marvelous signs of God and
the benefits conferred upon men by the Lord's
wondrous deeds, being taught to say ‘Oh God
we have heard with our ears, our fathers have
told us the work which thou didst in their
days, in days of old.'"
But now as we no
longer perceive the lofty arm" and the celes
tial right hand of our all-gracious God and uni
versal King by hearsay merely or report, but
observe so to speak in very deed and with
our own eyes that the declarations recorded
long ago are faithful and true, it is permitted
us to raise a second hymn of triumph and to
sing with loud voice, and say, "As we have
heard, so have we seen; in the city of the
Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.'"
And in what city but in this newly built
and God-constructed one, which is a ‘church
of the living God, a pillar and foundation of
truth,'" concerning which also another
the
divine oracle thus proclaims, ‘Glorious things
have been spoken of thee, oh city of God."
Since the all-gracious God has brought us to
gether to it, through the grace of his Only
Begotten, let every one of those who have been
summoned sing with loud voice and say, ‘I was
glad when they said unto me, we shall go unto
the house of the Lord,' " and ‘Lord, I have
loved the beauty of thy house and the place
where thy glory dwelleth.'" And let us
not only one by one, but all together, with
one spirit and one soul, honor him and cry
aloud, saying, ‘Great is the Lord and greatly to
be praised in the city of our God, in his holy
mountain.'"
For he is truly great, and great
is his house, lofty and spacious and "comely in
beauty above the sons of men." "Great is
the Lord who alone doeth wonderful things';"
‘great is he who doeth great things and things
past finding out, glorious and marvelous things
which cannot be numbered';* great is he ‘who

7 Eusebius addresses, first the assembled clergymen in general,
then Paulinus in particular, and finally the people, calling the latter
"nurslings," "habitation," "school," "auditory." The signifi
cance of the words as used by him is plain enough, but their colloca
tion is rather remarkable.

from their thrones and hath exalted them of
low degree from the earth. The hungry he hath
filled with good things and the arms of
the proud he hath broken." Not only to
the faithful, but also to unbelievers, has he
confirmed the record of ancient events; he that
worketh miracles, he that doeth great things, the
Master of all, the Creator of the whole world,
the omnipotent, the all-merciful, the one and
only God. To him let us sing the new song,"
supplying in thought," "To him who alone doeth

great wonders:
ever';* ‘To him which smote great kings, and
slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth
forever';* "For the Lord remembered us in
our low estate and delivered us from our
adversaries.' " And let us never cease to
cry aloud in these words to the Father of
the universe. And let us always honor him with
our mouth who is the second cause of our bene
fits, the instructor
in divine knowledge, the
teacher of the true religion, the destroyer of
the impious, the slayer of tyrants, the reformer
of life, Jesus, the Saviour of us who were
in despair.
For he alone, as the only all
gracious Son of an all-gracious Father, in
accordance with the purpose of his Father's
benevolence, has willingly put on the nature of
us who lay prostrate in corruption, and like
some excellent physician, who for the sake of
saving them that are ill, examines their suffer
ings, handles their foul sores, and reaps pain for
himself from the miseries of another," so us
who were not only diseased and afflicted with
terrible ulcers and wounds already mortified,
but were even lying among the dead, he hath
saved for himself from the very jaws of death.

other parts of the book.

some tragic poet. That they are quoted from an ancient writer is
clear enough from the Ionic forms which occur (opm, dAA9 spi no t,

For then when the whole
human race lay buried in gloomy night and
in depths of darkness through the deceitful arts
of guilty demons and the power of God-hating

the rays of his light, even as wax is melted.
But when malignant envy and the evil
loving demon wellnigh burst with anger at
such grace and kindness, and turned against us
all his death-dealing forces, and when, at first,
like a dog gone mad which gnashes his teeth at
the stones thrown at him, and pours out his rage
against his assailants upon the inanimate mis
siles, he leveled his ferocious madness at the
stones of the sanctuaries and at the lifeless mate
rial of the houses, and desolated the churches,
-at least as he supposed, - and then emitted
terrible hissings and snake-like sounds, now by
the threats of impious tyrants, and again by
the blasphemous edicts of profane rulers, vomit
ing forth death, moreover, and infecting with
his
poisons
the souls captured by him, and almost slaying
them by his death-fraught sacrifices of dead
idols, and causing every beast in the form of
man and every kind of savage to assault us,

Council," the great Captain" of God,
after the mightiest soldiers of his kingdom had
displayed sufficient exercise through patience
and endurance in everything, suddenly appeared
anew, and blotted out and annihilated his ene
mies and foes, so that they seemed never to
have had even a name.
But his friends and
relatives he raised to the highest glory, in the
presence not only of all men, but also of celes

but the meaning seems to be "without harm to himself," "un

Eusebius is perhaps thinking especially of
Christ's absolute sinlessness and victory over all temptation: per

such a task, strength possessed by Christ alone in sufficient measure

is open to dispute. That it asserts the Son to be possessed per se,
in and of himself, of absolute deity, - that is, that he is self-existent,
- can hardly be maintained, though Valesius does maintain it. The
word admits some latitude of meaning, as Heinichen shows (in his
edition of Eusebius, III. p. 736 sq., J/elet. XX.), and its use does
not forbid a belief in the subordination of the Son.

‘he spake, and they were made ; he commanded,

"A special discourse would be needed ac
curately to survey and explain all this; and
also to describe how great the zeal of the
laborers is regarded by him who is celebrated
as divine," who looks upon the living temple
which we all constitute, and surveys the house,
composed of living and moving stones, which
is well and surely built upon the foundation of
the apostles and prophets, the chief cornerstone
being Jesus Christ himself, who has been re
jected not only by the builders of that ancient
building which no longer stands, but also by the
builders - evil architects of evil works - of
the structure, which is composed of the mass
of men and still endures."
But the Father
has approved him both then and now, and
has made him the head of the corner
of this our common church. Who that
beholds this living temple of the living God
formed of ourselves - this greatest and truly
divine sanctuary, I say, whose inmost shrines
are invisible to the multitude and are truly holy
and a holy of holies - would venture to declare
it? Who is able even to look within the sacred
enclosure, except the great High Priest of all,
to whom alone it is permitted to fathom
the mysteries of every rational soul?
But

perhaps it
only, to be second after him in the same work,
namely, to the commander of this army whom
the first and great High Priest himself has

* Eusebius' reference to these various buildings is somewhat
confusing. He speaks first of the Church of Christ, "the living

obtained your people by the allotment and the
judgment of the Father, as if he had appointed
him his own servant and interpreter, a new
Aaron or Melchizedec, made like the Son of
God, remaining and continually preserved by
him in accordance with the united prayers
of all of you. To him therefore alone let
it be granted, if not in the first place, at
least in the second after the first and greatest
High Priest, to observe and supervise the in
most state of your souls, - to him who by ex
perience and length of time has accurately
proved each one, and who by his zeal and care
has disposed you all in pious conduct and doc
trine, and is better able than any one else to give
an account, adequate to the facts, of those things
which he himself has accomplished with the
Divine assistance. As to our first and great
High Priest, it
is said," "Whatsoever he
seeth the Father doing those things likewise the
Son also doeth.'"
So also this one," looking
up to him as to the first teacher, with pure eyes
of the mind, using as archetypes whatsoever
things he seeth him doing, produceth images of
them, making them so far as is possible in the
same likeness, in nothing inferior to that Beseleel,
whom God himself "filled with the spirit of wis
dom and understanding '" and with other tech
nical and scientific knowledge, and called to be
the maker of the temple constructed after
heavenly types given in symbols. Thus this
one also bearing in his own soul the image
of the whole Christ, the Word, the Wisdom, the
Light, has formed this magnificent temple of the
highest God, corresponding to the pattern of
the greater as a visible to an invisible, it
is
impossible to say with what greatness of soul,
with what wealth and liberality of mind, and
with what emulation on the part of all of you,
shown in the magnanimity of the contributors
who have ambitiously striven in no way to be left
behind by him in the execution of the same pur
pose. And this place, - for this deserves to be
mentioned first of all, - which had been cov

yield to the wickedness of those who had brought
about that condition of things, although he might
have chosen some other place, for many other
sites were available in the city, where he would
have had less labor, and been free from
trouble.

to the work, and then strengthened the
whole people with zeal, and formed them all

‘For," he says, "in the wilderness water has
broken out, and a pool in thirsty ground, and
the dry land shall be watered meadows, and
in the thirsty ground there shall be springs
of water."
These things which were
prophesied long ago have been recorded
in sacred books; but no longer are they trans
mitted to us by hearsay merely, but in facts.
This desert, this dry land, this widowed and
deserted one, ‘whose gates they cut down with
axes like wood in a forest, whom they broke
down with hatchet and hammer," whose books
also they destroyed," "burning with fire the
sanctuary of God, and profaning unto the ground
the habitation of his name," "whom all that
passed by upon the way plucked, and whose
fences they broke down, whom the boar out of
the wood ravaged, and on which the savage
wild beast fed," now by the wonderful power
of Christ, when he wills it, has become like a
lily.
For at that time also she was chastened at
his nod as by a careful father; ‘for whom the
Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth
every son whom he receiveth." Then after
being chastened in a measure, according to
the necessities of the case, she is commanded to
rejoice anew ; and she blossoms as a lily and
"For,'
exhales her divine odor among all men.
it is said, ‘water hath broken out in the wilder
ness," the fountain of the saving bath of divine
regeneration." And now she, who a little before
was a desert, "has become watered meadows,
and springs of water have gushed forth in a
thirsty land.'" The hands which before were
‘weak' have become "truly strong';" and these
works are great and convincing proofs of strong
hands.
The knees, also, which before were
"feeble and infirm,' recovering their wonted
strength, are moving straight forward in the
path of divine knowledge, and hastening to the
kindred flock" of the all-gracious Shepherd.
And if there are any whose souls have been
stupefied by the threats of the tyrants, not
even they are passed by as incurable by the
saving Word ; but he heals them also and urges
them on to receive divine comfort, saying, ‘Be
ye comforted, ye who are faint-hearted ; be
ye strengthened, fear not.'"

and excellent Zerubabel, having heard the
word which announced beforehand, that she who
had been made a desert on account of God
should enjoy these things, after the bitter cap

to pass that in truth ‘the latter glory of
this house is greater than the former.'"
For it was necessary and fitting that as her

her, and after his suffering had changed that

DISCOURSE

AT TY RE.

is indeed a very great wonder, passing all
admiration, especially to those who attend only
to the outward appearance; but more wonderful
than wonders are the archetypes and their mental
prototypes and divine models; I mean the re
productions of the inspired and rational
building in our souls.
This the Divine Son
himself created after his own image, impart
ing to it everywhere and in all respects the like
ness of God, an incorruptible nature, incorporeal,
rational, free from all earthly matter, a being
endowed with its own intelligence; and when
he had once called her forth from non-existence
into existence, he made her a holy spouse, an
all-sacred temple for himself and for the Father.
This also he clearly declares and confesses in
the following words: ‘I will dwell in them and
will walk in them ; and I will be their God, and
they shall be my people." Such is the perfect
and purified soul, so made from the beginning
as to bear the image of the celestial Word.
But when by the envy and zeal of the malig
nant demon she became, of her own volun
tary choice, sensual and a lover of evil, the
Deity left her; and as if bereft of a protector,
she became an easy prey and readily accessible
to those who had long envied her; and being
assailed by the batteries and machines of her
invisible enemies and spiritual foes, she suffered
a terrible fall, so that not one stone of virtue
remained upon another in her, but she lay
completely dead upon the ground, entirely di

vested of her natural ideas of God.

"But as she, who had been made in the
image of God, thus lay prostrate, it was
not that wild boar from the forest which we see
that despoiled her, but a certain destroying
demon and spiritual wild beasts who deceived
her with their passions as with the fiery darts
of their own wickedness, and burned the truly
divine sanctuary of God with fire, and profaned
to the ground the tabernacle of his name. Then
burying the miserable one with heaps of earth,
they destroyed every hope of deliverance.
But that divinely bright and saving Word,
her protector, after she had suffered the
merited punishment for her sins, again restored
her, securing the favor of the all-merciful

the highest rulers, he purified, through the
agency of those most divinely favored princes,
the whole earth from all the impious destroyers,
and from the terrible and God-hating tyrants
themselves. Then bringing out into the light
those who were his friends, who had long before
been consecrated to him for life, but in the midst,
as it were, of a storm of evils, had been concealed
under his shelter, he honored them worthily

* 2 Cor. vi. 16.

with the great gifts of the Spirit. And again, by
means of them, he cleared out and cleaned with
spades and mattocks - the admonitory words
of doctrine" - the souls which a little while
before had been covered with filth and burdened
with every kind of matter and rubbish of
impious ordinances.
And when he had
made the ground of all your minds clean
and clear, he finally committed it to this all
wise and God-beloved Ruler, who, being en
dowed with judgment and prudence, as well as
with other gifts, and being able to examine and
discriminate accurately the minds of those com
mitted to his charge, from the first day, so to
speak, down to the present, has not ceased to
build. Now he has supplied the brilliant gold,
again the refined and unalloyed silver, and the
precious and costly stones in all of you, so that
again is fulfilled for you in facts a sacred
and mystic prophecy, which says, "Behold
I make thy stone a carbuncle, and thy
foundations of sapphire, and thy battlements of
jasper, and thy gates of crystals, and thy wall of
chosen stones; and all thy sons shall be taught
of God, and thy children shall enjoy complete
peace; and in righteousness shalt thou be
built." Building therefore in righteousness,
he divided the whole people according to
their strength.
With some he fortified only the
outer enclosure, walling it up with unfeigned
faith; such were the great mass of the people
who were incapable of bearing a greater struc
ture.
Others he permitted to enter the build
ing, commanding them to stand at the door and
act as guides for those who should come in ;
these may be not unfitly compared to the vesti
bules of the temple.
Others he supported by
the first pillars which are placed without about
the quadrangular hall, initiating them into the
first elements of the letter of the four Gospels.
Still others he joined together about the basilica
on both sides; these are the catechumens who
are still advancing and progressing, and are not
far separated from the inmost view of divine
things granted to the faithful.
Taking from
among these the pure souls that have been
cleansed like gold by divine washing," he then

ings of the Scripture, and illumines them."

on either side of the authority of the Father,
Christ, and the Holy Spirit as second lights, he
exhibits abundantly and gloriously throughout
the entire building the clearness and splendor
of the truth of the rest in all its details. And
having selected from every quarter the living
and moving and well-prepared stones of the
souls, he constructs out of them all the great and
royal house, splendid and full of light both within
and without ; for not only soul and understand
ing, but their body also is made glorious by the
blooming ornament of purity and modesty.
66 And in this temple there are also thrones,
and a great number of seats and benches,
in all those souls in which sit the Holy Spirit's
gifts, such as were anciently seen by the sacred
apostles, and those who were with them, when
there "appeared unto them tongues parting asun
der, like as of fire, and sat upon each one
of them.'"
But in the leader of all it is
reasonable to suppose" that Christ himself
dwells in his fullness," and in those that occupy
the second rank after him, in proportion as
each is able to contain the power of Christ and
of the Holy Spirit." And the souls of some -
of those, namely, who are committed to each
of them for instruction and care - may be

and unique altar, what else could this be
than the pure holy of holies of the soul of the
common priest of all?
Standing at the right
of it, Jesus himself, the great High Priest of
the universe, the Only Begotten of God, receives
with bright eye and extended hand the sweet
incense from all, and the bloodless and imma
terial sacrifices offered in their prayers, and bears
them to the heavenly Father and God of the
universe.
And he himself first worships him,
and alone gives to the Father the reverence
which is his due, beseeching him also to con

tinue always kind and propitious to us all.

"Such is the great temple which the great
Creator of the universe, the Word, has built
throughout the entire world, making it an intel
lectual image upon earth of those things which lie
above the vault of heaven, so that throughout the
whole creation, including rational beings on earth,
his Father might be honored and adored.

and incomprehensible to us, - who that is mor
tal is able worthily to celebrate this?
‘For eye
hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of men those things which God
hath prepared for them that love him."
Since we, men, children, and women, small
and great, are already in part partakers of
these things, let us not cease all together, with
one spirit and one soul, to confess and praise the
author of such great benefits to us, ‘Who for
giveth all our iniquities, who healeth all our dis
eases, who redeemeth our life from destruction,
who crowneth us with mercy and compassion,
who satisfieth our desires with good things."
‘For he hath not dealt with us according to our
sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniqui
ties; " "for as far as the east is from the west,
so far hath he removed our iniquities from us.
Like as a father pitieth his own children, so
the Lord pitieth them that fear him.'"
Rekindling these thoughts in our memories,
both now and during all time to come, and
contemplating in our mind night and day, in
every hour and with every breath, so to speak,
the Author and Ruler of the present festival, and
of this bright and most splendid day, let us love
and adore him with every power of the soul.
And now rising, let us beseech him with loud
voice to shelter and preserve us to the end in
his fold, granting his unbroken and unshaken
peace forever, in Christ Jesus our Saviour;
through whom be the glory unto him forever
and ever."

Amen."

All but three of the

the last four being given by the majority of them as the title of

ter, which in two important MSS., followed by Stroth, is made a
part of chap. 5.
Heinichen inserts the words at this point because
they are out of place in the position in which they commonly occur:
but the truth is, they are no better adapted to the present chapter
than to that one, for only one of the edicts quoted in this chapter
has reference to the property of Christians.
It seems to me much
more likely that the words were originally written in the margin of
some codex opposite that particular rescript, and thence by an error
slipped into the text at the head of a later one, which was then made

other things, or rather first of all, to make such
decrees as seemed in many respects for the

preserve reverence and piety toward the deity.

translated "sects," and the
reference has been supposed to
be to various schismatic bodies included in the former edict, but,
as Mason remarks, such an interpretation is preposterous, and
introduces an idea in direct contradiction to the entire tenor of
the present document. The fact is that, although "sects" is the
natural translation of the word at peoets, we find the same word in
§ 6, below, used to translate conditiones, and it may be reasonably
assumed - in fact, it may be regarded as certain in view of the con
text - that in the present case the same word stood in the Latin
original. I have no hesitation, therefore, in adopting the rendering
which I have given in the text. These "conditions," then, to which

It was fitting that
we should write that this is our pleasure,

same Christians freedom and full liberty to
observe their own religion.
Since this has
been granted freely by us to them, thy de

others also who may wish to follow their own
religious observances; it being clearly in accord

one should have the liberty of choosing and
worshiping whatever deity he pleases.
This has
been done by us in order that we might not
seem in any way to discriminate against
any rank or religion." And we decree still
further in regard to the Christians, that their
places, in which they were formerly accustomed
to assemble, and concerning which in the former
letter sent to thy devotedness a different command
was given," if it appear that any have bought
them either from our treasury or from any other
person, shall be restored to the said Christians,
without demanding money or any other equiva
lent, with no delay or hesitation.
If any happen
to have received the said places as a gift, they
shall restore them as quickly as possible to
these same Christians: with the understanding that if those who have bought these
places, or those who have received them as a
gift, demand anything from our bounty, they
may go to the judge of the district, that pro

All these things are to be granted to the society

* It would seem that this communication was sent to Anulinus
soon after the issue of the Edict of Milan; for it gives directions for
the carrying out of some of the provisions made in that edict, and is
very likely but a sample of special letters sent in connection with
that document to the governors of the various provinces. We know
from the next chapter that Anulinus was proconsul of the Roman
province of Africa, of which Carthage was the capital city, and
which was very thickly populated with Christians. Of Anulinus
himself we know only what we can learn from this and the next two
chapters. The title of the rescript as given by Eusebius is some
what misleading.
There is no indication in the document itself that
it was written with the distinct purpose of distinguishing the Catho
lic Church from schismatic bodies, and granting it privileges denied
to them.
If such had been its aim, it would certainly have stated it
more clearly. The term "Catholic Church" (in § 16) seems in fact
to be used in a general sense to indicate the Christian Church as a
whole.
It is, to be sure, possible that Constantine may already
have had some knowledge of the schismatics whom he refers to in
another epistle, quoted in the next chapter; but his omission of all
reference to them in the present case shows that he did not intend at
this time to draw lines, between parties, or to pass judgment upon
any society calling itself a Christian church.

orth Africa.

"This and the next epistle were occasioned by the Donatist schism.
This great schism arose after the close of the Diocletian persecution,
and divided the church of North Africa for more than a century.
Like the Novatian schism, it was due to the conflict of the more
rigid and the more indulgent theories of discipline.
In Novatianism,
however, the burning question was the readmission of the lapsed;
in Donatism, the validity of clerical functions performed by unholy
or unfaithful clergymen.
In the latter, therefore, the question was
one of clerical, not lay discipline, and there was involved in it a
very important thcological principle. The Donatists maintained
that the validity of clerical functions depended upon the character
of the administering clergyman; the Catholic party maintained that
the validity of those functions depended solely upon Christ, and
was quite independent of the character of the officiating clergyman,
}. he had been duly qualified by the Church for the per
ormance of such functions.
Augustine, nearly a century after the
rise of the sect, found it necessary to oppose it, and it was in the
controversy with it that he developed his doctrine of the Church and
the Sacraments. The immediate occasion of the schism was the
election of Caecilianus, who favored the milder principles of church
discipline, to the bishopric of Carthage, in 311.
His election was
opposed by the entire rigoristic party in Carthage and throughout
It was claimed that the Bishop Felix of Aptunga,
by whom he was ordained, had been a traditor during the persecu
tion, and that therefore Caecilian's ordination was not valid. As a
consequence the bishops of Numidia, who had not been invited
to assist in the choice and ordination of Caecilian, held a synod
in Carthage, and elected a counter-bishop, Majorinus. Thus the
schism was definitely launched. The party called itself for a time
by the name of its first bishop, but in 315 he was succeeded by
Donatus, called the Great, to distinguish him from Donatus, bishop
of Casae Nigrae, who had been one of the original leaders of the
movement.
From him the sect took the name by which it was
thencesorth known. Doubtless personal jealousies and enmities had
considerable to do with the origin of the schism, but it is quite
inaccurate to ascribe it wholly to such causes. The sundamental
ground lay in the deep-seated difference in principles between the
two parties in the Church, and it was inevitable that that difference
should make itself felt in some such rupture, even had personal
reasons not co-operated to such an extent, as they did. Our chief
sources for a knowledge of Donatism are the anti-Donatistic works
of Augustine (see The AVicene, and Post-Micene Fathers, first
series, Vol. IV. p. 369 sq.), together with a number of his epistles,
and Optatus' De Schismate Donatista rum. The literature on
the subject is very extensive.
See especially Walesius' essay, De
Schi's mate Portat., appended to his edition of Eusebius (Reading's
edition, p. 775 sq.); Ribbeck, Donatus and A ugustinos, 1858; the
articles Caecilianus and Donatism in the Dict. of Christ. Bros. .

CONSTANTINE SUMMONS COUNCILS.

Since many such

of his colleagues in Africa, in many matters; *

has freely entrusted to my devotedness, and in
which there is a great population, the multitude

good to me that Caecilianus himself, with
ten of the bishops that appear to accuse him,
and with ten others whom he may consider
necessary for his defense, should sail to Rome,

Constantine did not voluntarily meddle
in the Donatistic controversy. . He was first appealed to by the
Donatists themselves, §. the proconsul Anulinus, early in the
year,313 (see Augustine, Epistle 88, for a copy of the letter in which

to their appeal Constantine (in the present epistle) summoned the
two parties to appear before a Roman synod, which was held in
October, 313. The Donatists were unable to prove their charges,
and the synod gave decision against them. Again, at their own
request, their case was heard at a council held in Gaul the following
year (the synod of Arles; see the next epistle of Constantine ...i
in this chapter). This council also decided against them, and the
Donatists appealed once more to the judgment of the emperor him
self. He heard their case in Milan in 316, and confirmed the de
cisions of the councils, and soon afterward issued laws against them,
threatening them with the banishment of their bishops and the con
fiscation of their property. He soon, however, withdrew his per
secuting measures, and adopted a policy of toleration.
During
subsequent reigns their condition grew worse, and they were often
obliged to undergo severe hardships; but they clung rigidly to their
rinciples until the invasion of the Vandals in 428, when the entire
North African Church was devastated.

not to epistles of Anulinus, but to the communications of the Dona
tists forwarded to the emperor by Anulinus.
In his epistle to the
emperor, which was written April 15, 313 (see Augustine, EA. 88),
Anulinus speaks of two communications handed to him, by the 120
natists, which he forwards to the emperor with his own letter. The
former of them, which is no longer extant, bore the title Libellus
ecclesiae Catholicar crimin it m Caeciliani.
The other, which is
reserved by Optatus (Du Pin's edition, p. 22, and Routh, Rel. Sac.
s: 280) contained the request that the emperor would appoint some
Gallic bishops to hear the case, because the church of that country
had not been subjected to the same temptation as themselves during
the persecution, and could therefore render an impartial decision. It
was in consequence of this request that the Gallic bishops mentioned
below were directed by the emperor to proceed to Rome to join with
Miltiades in the adjudication of the case.
Constantine speaks of
receiving many such communications, but no others are preserved
to us.

zo Caecilianus had been arch-deacon of the church of Carthage
under the bishop Mensurius, and had been a diligent supporter of
the latter in his opposition to the fanatical conduct and the extreme
rigor of the stricter party during the persecution.
In 311 he became
bishop, and lived until about 345. We know nothing about his life
after the first few years of the conflict.
His title to the bishopric
was universally acknowledged outside of North Africa, and by all
there except the Donatists themselves.
* The chief charge brought against Caecilian was that he had
been ordained by a traditor, #. of Aptunga, and that his ordina
tion was therefore invalid. The charge against Felix was carefull
investigated at the Council of Arles, and pronounced quite ...}.
less. Many personal charges, such as cruelty to the martyrs in
rison (which had its ground, doubtless, in his condemnation of the
oolish fanaticism which was so common during the persecution in
Africa), tyranny, bloodthirstiness, &c., were brought against Cae
cilian, but were dismissed in every case as quite groundless.

the references given below). An extended account of him, largely
legendary, is given by Gregory of Tours (De gloria Com/. 75, ac
cording to the Dict. of Christ. Biog.). The dates of his accession
and death are unknown to us. He attended the Council of Arles in
313 (see the list of those present, in Routh, IV. p. 312), and is
spoken of in high terms by Koi. (Contra 9 us. o 7; Opus int
Aer/. cont. 9 ul. I. 55), and also by Jerome, who informs us that he
wrote a commentary on the Song of Songs and a work against No
vatian (see his de vir. Fol. 82, EA. ad Florentium, and ad J/arcel

by nineteen bishops, - the three from Gaul just mentioned, Milti

at the Council of Arles (see Routh, IV. 312), and in consequence it
has been thought that he presided at the Council, a conclusion
which some have regarded as confirmed by Constantine's own words
in § 24, below.
But on the other hand, in the epistle of the synod
addressed to Sylvester of Rome, and containing the canons of the
Council, it is distinctly stated that Marinus, bishop of Arles, pre
sided; and this in itself seems more probable, although the docu
ment in which the statement is found may not perhaps be genuine
(see, for instance, Ffoulke's article Marinus in the Dict. of Christ.
A fog., which needs, however, to be taken with allowance, for the
case against the genuineness of the extant canons of the Council is
by no means so strong as he implies). Of Chrestus himself we know
nothing more than can be gathered from this epistle.

* The accompanying epistle furnishes the first instance which we
have of financial support furnished the clergy by the state. From
this time on the old system of voluntary contributions sell more and
more into disuse, and the clergy gained their support from the
income upon the church property, which accumulated rapidly, in
consequence of special grants by the state and voluntary gifts and
legacies by pious Christians, or from imperial bounties, as in the
resent case. Chrysostom, however, complains that the clergy in
is time were not as well supported as under the ancient voluntary
system. The accuracy of his statement, however, is open to doubt,
as is the accuracy of all such comparisons between an earlier age
and our own, unless it be based upon exhaustive statistics. Upon
the general subject of the maintenance of the clergy in the early
Church, see Bingham's Antiquities, Bk. V. Compare also Hatch's

If it is,
it leads us to suppose that Constantine had heard about the troubles
in Carthage before he received the communication from Anulinus
referred to in the previous chapter; for we can hardly suppose that
pending the trial of Caecilian Constantine would show him such sig
nal marks of favor, which would lay him at once open to the charge
of partiality, and would be practically a prejudgment of the case.
On the other hand, he could not have referred to the Donatists in
this way after the trial of the case, for his words imply that he is
referring, not to an already well-established and wo party,
but simply to individuals whom he has recently learned to be making
some kind of trouble in the church. These considerations seem to
me to lead to the conclusion that this epistle preceded the one to
Miltiades quoted in the previous chapter, and also the one from
Anulinus to Constantine (see notes 16 and 19 on that chapter).
If
this be so, it must have been written as early as April, 313, and
therefore soon after the epistle to Anulinus quoted in the previous
chapter, $ 15 sq., .We might then be led to suppose that it was in
consequence of this grant made by Constantine solely to Caecilian
and the clergy under him that the Donatists decided to appeal to
the emperor, his treatment of all who were opposed to Caecilian
...; them that he had heard reports of them by no means to
their advantage, and thus impelling them to try and set themselves
right in his eyes and in the eyes of the world by a public investiga

The Subsequent Wickedness of Licinius, and his
. Death.

SUCH blessings did divine and heavenly
grace confer upon us through the appear
ance of our Saviour, and such was the abun
dance of benefits which prevailed among all
men in consequence of the peace which we
enjoyed. And thus were our affairs crowned
with rejoicings and festivities.
But malig

these things; and moreover the events that
befell the tyrants whom we have already men

he waged an impious and most terrible war
against him, paying regard neither to laws of
nature, nor treaties, nor blood, and giving
no thought to covenants."
For Constantine,
like an all-gracious emperor, giving him

the leading bishop of North Africa, and thus recognized as in 'some
sense at the head of the church of that entire section of country.
* To speak of Licinius as alone responsible for the civil war
between himself and Constantine, which ended in his own downfall,
is quite unjustifiable; indeed, this entire chapter is a painful example
of the way in which prejudice distorts facts.
The positions of the
two emperors was such that a final struggle between them for the

which seeins to have resulted from Licinius' refusal to deliver up
a relative of his own, who had in some way been concerned in a
conspiracy against Constantine. The occasion of the war is not
perfectly plain, but it is certain that Constantine, not Licinius, was
the agoressor.
Constantine came off victorious, but was not able to
overthrow his rival, and a treaty was concluded by which Illyricum,
one of Licinius' most important provinces, was ceded to Constantine.
The two emperors remained at peace, each waiting for a time when
he could with advantage attack the other, until 323, when a second
and greater war broke out, to which Eusebius, who omits all reser
ence to the former, refers in these two chapters. The immediate
occasion of this war, as of the former, is obscure, but it was certainly
not due to Constantine's pity for the oppressed Christian subjects of
Licinius, and his pious desire to avenge their sufferings, as Eusebius,
who in his I ota, Const. II. 3, in contradiction to this present pas
sage, claims for his prince the honor of beginning the war without
any other provocation, would have us believe. , Doubtless the fact
that Licinius was persecuting his Christian subjects had much to
do with the outbreak of the war; for Constantine saw clearly that
Licinius had weakened his hold upon his subjects by his conduct,
and that therefore a good time had arrived to strike the decisive
blow. A pretext - for of course Constantine could not go to war
without some more material and plausible pretext than sympathy
with oppressed Christian brethren - was furnished by some sort
of a misunderstanding in regard to the respective rights of the two
sovereigns in the border territory along the Danube frontier, and
the war began by Constantine taking the initiative, and invading his
rival's territory. Two battles were fought, - one at Adrianople in
July, and the other at Chrysopolis in September, 323, -in both of
which Constantine was victorious, and the latter of which resulted
in the surrender of Licinius, and the accession of Constantine to the
supreme sovereignty of both East and West.

ed., I. p. 490 sq., and Burckhardt's Zeit Constantins, 2d ed.,

evidences of true favor, did not refuse alliance
with him, and did not refuse him the illustrious
marriage with his sister, but honored him by
making him a partaker of the ancestral nobility
and the ancient imperial blood," and granted
him the right of sharing in the dominion over
all as a brother-in-law and co-regent, conferring
upon him the government and administration of
no less a portion of the Roman provinces
than he himself possessed."
But Licinius,
on the contrary, pursued a course directly
opposite to this ; forming daily all kinds of plots
against his superior, and devising all sorts of
mischief, that he might repay his benefactor
with evils.
At first he attempted to conceal his
preparations, and pretended to be a friend, and
practiced frequently fraud and deceit, in the
hope that he might easily accomplish the
desired end."
But God was the friend, protector, and guardian of Constantine, and
bringing the plots which had been formed in
secrecy and darkness to the light, he foiled them.
So much virtue does the great armor of piety
possess for the warding off of enemies and for
the preservation of our own safety.

that his secret preparations by no means
progressed according to his mind, - for God
revealed every plot and wickedness to the God
favored emperor, - being no longer able to con
ceal himself, he undertook an open war."
And at the same time that he determined
to wage war with Constantine, he also
proceeded to join battle with the God of the
universe, whom he knew that Constantine wor
shiped, and began, gently for a time and quietly,
to attack his pious subjects, who had never done
This he did under
his government any harm."

* A more flagrant misrepresentation of facts could hardly be
imagined.
Licinius received his appointment directly from Galerius
and owed nothing whatever to Constantine; in fact, was an Augustus
before the latter was, and held his half of the empire quite indepen
dently of the latter, and indeed by a far clearer title than Constantine

* There is no reason to suppose that Licinius was any more

guilty than Constantine in these respects.

* This is in direct contradiction to Eusebius' own statement in
his l'ita Comst. II. 3 (see above, note 1), and is almost certainly
incorrect.

ischeo p. 5 sq., did not begin to persecute the
* Licinius, as Görres has shown in his able essay Die Licinian
Christians until the year 3i) (the persecution was formerly com
monly supposed to have begun some three or four years earlier).
The causes of his change of policy in this matter it is impossible to
state with certainty, but the exceedingly foolish step seems to have
been chiefly due to his growing hatred and suspicion of the Chris
tians as the friends of Constantine. Though he had not hitherto
been hostile to then, he had yet never taken any pains to win their
friendship and to secure their enthusiastic support as Constantine
had, and as a consequence they naturally looked with envy upon
their brethren in the west, who were enjoying such signal marks of
imperial favor.
Licinius could not but be conscious of this; and as
the relations between himself and Constantine became more and
more strained, it was not unnatural for him to acquire a peculiar
enmity toward them, and finally to suspect them of a conspiracy, in
favor of his rival. Whether he had any grounds for such a suspicion
we do not know, but at any rate he began to show his changed atti
tude in 319 by clearing his palace of Christians (see § to). No
more foolish step can be imagined than the opening of a persecution

the compulsion of his innate wickedness
which drove him into terrible blindness. He
did not therefore keep before his eyes the
memory of those who had persecuted the Chris
tians before him, nor of those whose destroyer
and executioner he had been appointed, on
account of the impieties which they had com
mitted.
But departing from sound reason, being
seized, in a word, with insanity, he determined
to war against God himself as the ally of Con
stantine, instead of against the one who was
assisted by him. And in the first place, he
drove from his house every Christian, thus
depriving himself, wretched man, of the prayers
which they offered to God in his behalf, which
they are accustomed, according to the teaching
of their fathers, to offer for all men. Then he
commanded that the soldiers in the cities should
be cashiered and stripped of their rank unless
they chose to sacrifice to the demons. And yet
these were small matters when compared
with the greater things that followed. Why
it necessary to relate minutely and in
is
detail all that was done by the hater of God,
and to recount how this most lawless man in
vented unlawful laws?" He passed an ordinance
that no one should exercise humanity toward the
sufferers in prison by giving them food, and that
none should show mercy to those that were per
ishing of hunger in bonds; that no one should
in any way be kind, or do any good act, even
though moved by Nature herself to sympathize
with one's neighbors. And this was indeed an
openly shameful and most cruel law, calculated
to expel all natural kindliness. And in addition
to this it was also decreed, as a punishment, that
those who showed compassion should suffer the
same things with those whom they compassion
ated ; and that those who kindly ministered to

at this critical juncture.
Just at a time when he needed the most
loyal support of all his subjects, he wantonly alienated the affections
o: large and influential portion of them, and in the very act gave
them good reason to become devoted adherents of his enemy. The
persecution of Licinius, as Görres has clearly shown (ibid. p. 29 sq.)
was limited in its extent and mild in its character.
It began, as
Eusebius informs us, with the expulsion of Christians from the pal
ace, but even here it was not universal; at least, Eusebius of Nico
media and other prominent clergymen still remained Licinius' friends,
and were treated as such by him. In fact, he evidently punished only
those whom he thought to be his enemies and to be interested in the
success of Constantine, if not directly conspiring in his behalf. No
general edicts of persecution were issued by him, and the sufferings
of the Christians seem to have been confined almost wholly to occa
sional loss of property or banishment, or, still less frequently, im
prisonment. R few bishops appear to have been put to death, but
there is no reason to suppose that they suffered at the command of
Licinius himself. Of course, when it was known that he was hos
tile to the Christians, sanatical heathen officials might venture, oc
casionally at least, to violate the existing laws and bring hated
bishops to death on one pretext or another.
But such cases were
certainly rare, and there seem to have been no instances of execu
tion on the simple ground of Christianity, as indeed there could not
be while the Edict of Milan remained unrepealed.
Eusebius' state
ment that Licinius was about to proceed to severer measures, when
the war with Constantine broke out and put a stop to his plans, is
very likely true; but otherwise his report is rather highly colored,
as many other sources fully warrant us in saying. For a careful and
very satisfactory discussion of this whole subject, see Görres, ibid.
p. 32 sq.

* Note the play on the word vôuos. voucus &vöuovs 6 mavavouco

the suffering should be thrown into bonds and
into prison, and should endure the same punish
ment with the sufferers.
Such were the decrees
of Licinius.

Why should we recount his innovations
in regard to marriage or in regard to the
dying - innovations by which he ventured to
annul the ancient laws of the Romans which
had been well and wisely formed, and to intro
duce certain barbarous and cruel laws, which
were truly unlawful and lawless?' He invented,
to the detriment of the provinces which were
subject to him, innumerable prosecutions," and
all sorts of methods of extorting gold and silver,
new measurements of land" and injurious exac
tions from men in the country, who were
no longer living, but long since dead. Why
is it necessary to speak at length of the
banishments which, in addition to these things,
this enemy of mankind inflicted upon those
who had done no wrong, the expatriations of
men of noble birth and high reputation whose
young wives he snatched from them and con
signed to certain baser fellows of his own, to be
shamefully abused by them, and the many mar
ried women and virgins upon whom he gratified
his passions, although he was in advanced age"
- why, I say, is it necessary to speak at length
of these things, when the excessive wickedness
of his last deeds makes the first appear
small and of no account?

to shine forth as in the midst of a dark and
gloomy night, and raised up a deliverer for all,
leading into those regions with a lofty arm, his
servant, Constantine.

CHAPTER IX.

The Victory of Constantine, and the Blessings
which under him accrued to the Suðjects of
the Roman Empire.

To him, therefore, God granted, from
heaven above, the deserved fruit of piety,
the trophies of victory over the impious, and
he cast the guilty one with all his counselors
and friends prostrate at the feet of Con
stantine.
For when Licinius carried his
madness to the last extreme, the emperor,
the friend of God, thinking that he ought no
longer to be tolerated, acting upon the basis of
sound judgment, and mingling the firm princi

important city of Pontus, situated on the river Iris.

ples of justice with humanity, gladly determined
to come to the protection of those who were
oppressed by the tyrant, and undertook, by put
ting a few destroyers out of the way, to save
the greater part of the human race."
For
when he had formerly exercised humanity
alone and had shown mercy to him who was not
worthy of sympathy, nothing was accomplished;
for Licinius did not renounce his wickedness,
but rather increased his fury against the peoples
that were subject to him, and there was left to
the afflicted no hope of salvation, oppressed
as they were by a savage beast. Wherefore,
the protector of the virtuous, mingling hatred
for evil with love for good, went forth with his
son Crispus, a most beneficent prince," and ex
tended a saving right hand to all that were per
ishing.
Both of them, father and son, under
the protection, as it were, of God, the universal
King, with the Son of God, the Saviour of
all, as their leader and ally, drew up their forces
on all sides against the enemies of the Deity and
won an easy victory; * God having prospered
them in the battle in all respects according
to their wish.
Thus, suddenly, and sooner
than can be told, those who yesterday and
the day before breathed death and threatening
were no more, and not even their names were
remembered, but their inscriptions and their
honors suffered the merited disgrace. And the
things which Licinius with his own eyes had
seen come upon the former impious tyrants he
himself likewise suffered, because he did not
receive instruction nor learn wisdom from the
chastisements of his neighbors, but followed the
same path of impiety which they had trod, and
was justly hurled over the same precipice.
Thus he lay prostrate.

But Constantine, the mightiest victor,
adorned with every virtue of piety, together with
his son Crispus, a most God-beloved prince,
and in all respects like his father, recovered the
East which belonged to them ;" and they formed
one united Roman empire as of old, bringing
under their peaceful sway the whole world from
the rising of the sun to the opposite quarter,
both north and south, even to the extremities

Crispus, the oldest son of
Constantine, by his first wife Minervina, was born about the begin
ning of the fourth century, made Caesar in 317, and put to death
by Constantine in 326 on suspicion, whether justified or not we do
not know; of conspiracy and treason. Qur sources agree in pro
nouncing him a young man of most excellent character and marked
ability; and indeed he proved his valor and military talents in the
west in a campaign against the Franks, and also in the present war
with Licinius, in which he won a great naval battle, and thus con
tributed materially to his father's victory.
His execution is the
darkest blot on the memory of Constantine, and however it may be
palliated can never, as it seems, be excused.

of the declining day.
All fear therefore
of those who had formerly afflicted them
was taken away from men, and they cele
brated splendid and festive days.
Everything
was filled with light, and those who before were
downcast beheld each other with smiling faces
and beaming eyes.
With dances and hymns,
in city and country, they glorified first of all
God the universal King, because they had been
thus taught, and then the pious emperor
with his God-beloved children. There was
oblivion of past evils and forgetfulness of
every deed of impiety; there was enjoyment of
present benefits and expectation of those yet to
come.
Edicts full of clemency and laws con
taining tokens of benevolence and true piety

were issued in every place by the victorious
emperor." Thus after all tyranny had been
purged away, the empire which belonged to
them was preserved firm and without a rival for
Constantine and his sons alone." And having
obliterated the godlessness of their predecessors,
recognizing the benefits conferred upon them
by God, they exhibited their love of virtue and
their love of God, and their piety and gratitude
to the Deity, by the deeds which they performed
in the sight of all men.

Eusebius in his lota Const. Bk. II.

Crispus in the previous paragraphs, that the Assistory was completed

ON Bk. III. chap. 3, § 5 (note 17, continued).
Since this note was in type Dr. Gardiner's admirable and exhaustive essay on the authorship
of the Epistle to the Hebrews (in the Micene and Post-Nicene Fathers, First Series, Vol. XIV. p.
341 sq.) has come to hand, and I have been much pleased to see that the theory that Barnabas
wrote the epistle is accepted and defended with vigor.

On Bk. III. chap. 24, § 17 (note 18, continued).
In three places in the Church History (Bk. III. chap. 24, § 17, chap. 25, § 2, and chap. 39,
§ 16) John's "former" epistle is referred to, as if he had written only two.
In the last passage
the use of trporépa instead of trporm might be explained as Westcott suggests (Canon of the AVew
Zestament, p. 77, note 2), by supposing Eusebius to be reproducing the words of Papias; but in

the other passages this explanation will not do, for the words are certainly Eusebius' own.
the Muratorian Canon only two epistles of John are mentioned, and in Irenaeus the second epistle
is quoted as if it were the first (see Westcott, ibis. p. 384, note 1). These facts lead Westcott
to ask: "Is it possible that the second epistle was looked upon as an appendix to the first? and
may we thus explain the references to two epistles of John?" He continues: "The first epistle,
as is well known, was called ad Parthos by Augustine and some other Latin authorities; and the
same title trpos IIáptovs is given to the second epistle in one Greek manuscript (62 Scholz). The
Latin translation of Clement's Out/ines (IV. 66) says: Secunda /ohannis epistola qua ad virgines
(trap6évous) scriffa simp/issima ess.
Jerome, it may be added, quotes names from the third
epistle as from the second (De nom. //e/r.)." On the other hand, in Bk. V. chap. 8, § 7, Euse
bius speaks of the "first" (Tporo) epistle of John, and in Bk. III. chap. 25, $ 3, he expressly
It is evident, therefore, that whatever the use of
mentions a second and third epistle of John.
Tporépa instead of Tptorm in connection with John's first epistle may mean as used by others, it
does not indicate a knowledge of only a first and second as used by him.
It is by no means
impossible, however, that Westcott's suggestion may be correct, and that the first and second
epistles were sometimes looked upon as but one, and it is possible that such use of them by some
of his predecessors may account for Eusebius' employment of the word Tporéoa in three separate
passages.

The words j bepopévn Bapyūsła riorroMo have been commonly translated "the so-called Epistle
of Barnabas," or "the Epistle ascribed to Barnabas," implying a doubt in Eusebius' mind as to
the authenticity of the work.
This translation, however, is, in my opinion, quite unwarranted.
There are passages in Eusebius where the word bipouat used in connection with writings cannot
by any possibility be made to bear this meaning ; cases in which it can be interpreted only

These passages, and many others which are cited by Heinichen (Vol. III. p. 91), prove that the
word is frequently used in the sense of "extant" or "in circulation."
But in spite of these
numerous examples, Heinichen maintains that the word is also used by Eusebius in another and
quite different sense; namely, "so-called "or "ascribed to," thus equivalent to Aeyopévy). A care
ful examination, however, of all the passages cited by him in illustration of this second meaning
will show that in them too the word may be interpreted in the same way as in those already
referred to ; in fact, that in many of them that is in itself the more natural interpretation. The
passages to which we refer are Bk. III. chap. 25, §§ 2, 3, and 4; III. 3. I, rov & bepopévmy airot
Sevrépay; III. 39. 6 (where I ought to have translated "is extant under the name of John "). To
draw a distinction between the meaning of the word as used in these and in the other passages
is quite arbitrary, and therefore unwarranted. The sense in which, as we have found, Eusebius
so commonly employs the word attaches also to the Latin word fertur in the Muratorian Canon.
I have not endeavored to trace carefully the use of the word in other writers; but while many
instances occur in which it is certainly used in this sense, others in which either interpretation is
allowable, I have not yet found one in which this meaning is ruled out by the nature of the case
or by the context.
In view of these facts I believe we should be careful to draw a sharp distinc
tion between Aeyouévm or kaxoupévn and bepopévm when used in connection with written works.

A considerable portion of my translation was in type before I had observed this distinction

The Greek reads träorms ékkAmoréas (without the article), and so, two lines below, ov ráorm ékk\morso.
All the translators (with the exception of Pratten in the Ante-Micene Fathers, Vol. VIII.,
who reads, "the churches") render "the whole church," as if reading ràs with the article. We
have not, it is true, enough of Hegesippus' writings to be able to ascertain positively his use of
rås, and it is possible that he carelessly employed it indifferently with or without the article to
signify the definite "all" or "the whole."
In the absence of positive testimony, however, that
he failed to draw the proper distinction between its use with and its use without the article, and
in view of the fact that Eusebius himself (as well as other early Fathers so far as I am able to
recall) is very consistent in making the distinction, I have not felt at liberty in my translation
to depart from a strict grammatical interpretation of the phrases in question.
Moreover, upon
second thought, it seems quite as possible that Hegesippus meant to say "every" not "all" ;
for he can hardly have supposed these relatives of the Lord to have presided literally over the
whole Church, while he might very well say that they presided each over the church in the city in
which he lived, which is all that the words necessarily imply. The phrase just below, "in every
church," is perhaps as natural as "in the whole church."

Since the above note was in type Resch's important work on the Agrapha (von Gebhardt and
Harnack's 7exse und. Untersuchungen, Bd. V. Heft 4) has come to hand. On p. 27 sq. he dis
cusses at considerable length the sources of the Synoptic Gospels. He accepts the theory which
is most widely adopted by New-Testament critics, that the synoptic tradition as contained in our
Synoptic Gospels rests upon an original Gospel of Mark (nearly if not quite identical with our
present Gospel of Mark) and a pre-canonical Hebrew Gospel.
In agreement with such critics
he draws a sharp distinction between this original Hebrew Gospel and our canonical Greek
Matthew, while at the same time recognizing that the latter reproduces that original more fully

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

than either of the other Gospels does.
This original Hebrew he then identifies with the A6) wa
referred to by Papias as composed by Matthew in the Hebrew tongue (see Bk. III. chap. 39,
§ 16); that is, with the traditional Hebrew Gospel of Matthew (see ibid. chap. 24, note 5). The
arguments which he urges in support of this position are very strong. Handmann regards the
Gospel according to the Hebrews as the second original source of the synoptic tradition, along
side of the Ur-Marcus, and even suggests its identification with the A6)wa of Papias, and yet
denies its identity with the Hebrew Matthew. On the other hand, Resch regards the Hebrew
Matthew, which he identifies with the Aóywa of Papias, as the second original source of the synop
tic tradition, alongside of Mark or the Ur-Marcus, and yet, like Handmann, though on entirely
different grounds, denies the identity of the Gospel according to the Hebrews with the Hebrew
Matthew.
Their positions certainly tend to confirm my suggestion that the Hebrew Matthew
and the Gospel according to the Hebrews were originally identical (see above, Bk. III. chap. 27,
note 8).

Zhe Successors of Antoninus Pius.

On Bk. V. Introd. § 1 (note 3, continued).
Antoninus Pius was succeeded in 161 by his adopted sons, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
Verus and Lucius Ceionius AElius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus. Upon his accession to
the throne the former transferred his name Verus to the latter, who was thenceforth called
Lucius Aurelius Verus.
In his Chronicle Eusebius keeps these two princes distinct, but in
his //istory he falls into sad confusion in regard to them, and this confusion has drawn upon
him the severe censure of all his critics. He knew of course, as every one did, that Antoninus
Pius had two successors.
10, he states this directly, and gives
the names of the successors as "Marcus Aurelius Verus, who was also called Antoninus," and
From that point on he calls the former of these princes simply Antoninus Verus,
"Lucius."
Antoninus, or Verus, dropping entirely the name Marcus Aurelius.
In Bk. IV. chap. 18, § 2, he
speaks of the emperor "whose times we are now recording," that is, the successor of Antoninus
Pius, and calls him Antoninus Verus.
In Bk. V. Introd. § 1 he refers to the same emperor as
Antoninus Verus, and in Bk. V. chap. 4, § 3, and chap. 9, he calls him simply Antoninus, while
in Bk. IV. chap. 13, § 8, he speaks of him as the "Emperor Verus." The death of this Emperor
Antoninus is mentioned in Bk. V. chap. 9, and it is there said that he reigned nineteen years
and was then succeeded by Commodus. It is evident that in all these passages he is referring
to the emperor whom we know as Marcus Aurelius, but to whom he gives that name only once,
when he records his accession to the empire. On the other hand, in Bk. V. chap. 5, § 1, Euse
bius speaks of Marcus Aurelius Caesar and expressly distinguishes him from the Emperor
Antoninus, to whom he has referred at the close of the previous chapter, and makes him the
brother of that emperor.
Again, in the same chapter, § 6, he calls this Marcus Aurelius Caesar,
just referred to, the "Emperor Marcus," still evidently distinguishing him from the Emperor
Antoninus.
In this chapter, therefore, he thinks of Marcus Aurelius as the younger of the two
sons left by Antoninus Pius; that is, he identifies him with the one whom we call Lucius Verus,
and whom he himself calls Lucius in Bk. IV. chap. 14, § 10.
Eusebius thus commits a palpable
error. How are we to explain it?

-

The explanation seems to me to lie

in the circumstance that Eusebius attempted to
reconcile the tradition that Marcus Aurelius was not a persecutor with the fact known to

emperors had persecuted. Of course, among the good emperors was included the philosophical
Marcus Aurelius (cf. e.g. Tertullian's Apos. chap. 5, to which Eusebius refers in Bk. V. chap. 5).
It was of Marcus Aurelius, moreover, that the story of the Thundering Legion was told (see ibid.).
But Eusebius was not able to overlook the fact that numerous martyrdoms occurred during the
reign of the successor of Antoninus Pius. He had the documents recording the terrible persecu
tion at Lyons and Vienne; he had an apology of Melito, describing the hardships which the
Christians endured under the same emperor (see Bk. IV. chap. 26). He found himself, as an
historian, face to face with two apparently contradictory lines of facts. How was the contradiction
to be solved? He seems to have solved it by assuming that a confusion of names had taken place,
and that the prince commonly known as Marcus Aurelius, whose noble character was traditional,
and whose friendship to the Christians he could not doubt, was the younger, not the older of the
two brothers, and therefore not responsible for the numerous martyrdoms which took place after
the death of Antoninus Pius. And yet he is not consistent with himself even in his History; for
he gives the two brothers their proper names when he first mentions them, and says nothing of
an identification of Marcus Aurelius with Lucius.
It is not impossible that the words Marcus
Aurelius, which are used nowhere else of the older brother, are an interpolation; but for this there
is no evidence, and it may be suggested as more probable that at the time when this passage was
written the solution of the difficulty which he gives distinctly in Bk. V. chap. 5 had not yet oc
curred to him. That he should be able to fancy that Marcus Aurelius was identical with Lucius is
perhaps not strange when we remember how much confusion was caused in the minds of other
writers besides himself by the perplexing identity of the names of the various members of the
Antonine family. To the two successors of Antoninus Pius, the three names, Aurelius, Verus, and

think that the name Marcus may also have belonged to the younger one.
This supposition would
seem to him to find some confirmation in the fact that the most common official designation of
the older successor of Antoninus Pius was not Marcus Aurelius, but Antoninus simply, or M.
Antoninus. The name Marcus Aurelius or Marcus was rather a popular than an official designa

tion between Antoninus the emperor and Marcus, or Marcus Aurelius; for while he speaks of the
"Emperor Antoninus" at the beginning of the passages in which he recounts the story of the
Thundering Legion (year of Abr. 2188), he says at the close : literae quoque exstant Marci regis
(the M. Aure/i gravissimi imperatoris of Jerome looks like a later expansion of the simpler origi
nal) quibus testatur copias suas iamiam perituras Christianorum precibus servatas esse. But even
when he had reached the solution pointed out, Eusebius did not find himself clear of difficulties;
for his sources put the occurrence of the Thundering Legion after the date at which the younger
brother was universally supposed to have died, and it was difficult on still other grounds to
suppose the prince named Marcus Aurelius already dead in 169 (the date given by Eusebius
In this emergency he came to the conclusion
himself in his Chronicle for the death of Lucius).
that there must be some mistake in regard to the date of his death, and possessing no record of
the death of Marcus Aurelius as distinct from Antoninus, he simply passed it by without mention.
That Eusebius in accepting such a lame theory showed himself altogether too much under the
influence of traditional views cannot be denied ; but when we remember that the tradition that
Marcus Aurelius was not a persecutor was supported by writers whose honesty and accuracy he
could never have thought of questioning, as well as by the very nature of the case, we must, while
we smile at the result, at least admire his effort to solve the contradiction which he, as an histo

Westcott suggests that his mother may have
been of Jewish descent, because in an epistle of Jerome (ad. Pau/am : Ep. 39, § 1, Migne's ed.)
he is said to have learned Hebrew so thoroughly that he "vied with his mother " in the singing of
psalms (but compare the stricture of Redepenning on this passage, p. 187, note 1). The date
of his birth may be gathered from the fact (stated in this chapter) that he was in his seventeenth

year at the time of his father's death, which gives us 185 or 186 as the year of his birth (cf. Rede
penning, I. p. 417-420, Erste Beilage). We learn from the present chapter that as a boy he
was carefully trained by his father in the Scriptures and afterward in Greek literature, a training
of which he made good use in later life. He was also a pupil of Clement in the catechetical
school, as we learn from chaps. 6 and 14 (on the time, see chap. 6, note 4). He showed
remarkable natural ability, and after the death of his father (being himself saved from martyrdom
only by a device of his mother), when left in poverty with his mother and six younger brothers
(see § 13 of this chapter), he was able, partly by the assistance of a wealthy lady and partly by
teaching literature, to support himself (§ 14).

officially committed to him by Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria (see chap. 3). He lived at
this time a life of rigid asceticism (ibid.), and even went so far as to mutilate himself in his zeal
for the prosecution of his work (see chap. 8).
His great influence naturally aroused the hostility
of unbelievers against him ; but though many of his pupils suffered martyrdom (see chap. 4), he

God (ibid.).
During these years in which he was at the head of the catechetical school, he
devoted himself with vigor to the study of Greek philosophy, and was for a time a pupil of the
Neo-Platonist Ammonius Saccas (chap. 19). He studied non-Christian thought, as he tells us,
in order that he might be the better able to instruct his pagan and heretical pupils (ibid.).
His
labors in the school in time grew so heavy that he was obliged to associate with himself his friend
and fellow-pupil Heraclas, to whom he committed the work of elementary instruction (chap. 15).
It was during this time that he seems to have begun his Hexap/a, having learned Hebrew in order
to fit himself the better for his work upon the Old Testament (chap. 16).
During this period
(while Zephyrinus was bishop of Rome, i.e. before 217) he made a brief visit to Rome (chap. 14),
and later he was summoned to Arabia, to give instruction to the governor of that country, and
remained there a short time (chap. 19).
Afterward, on account of a great tumult in Alexandria
(see chap. 19, note 22), he left the city and went to Caesarea in Palestine, where, although only
a layman, he publicly expounded the Scriptures in the church (chap. 19). The bishop Deme
trius strongly disapproved of this, and summoned him back to Alexandria (ibid.). Upon his
return to Alexandria he entered upon the work of writing Commentaries on the Scriptures (see
During this period he wrote also other important works (see chap. 24).
chap. 23).

In the tenth year of Alexander Severus (A.D. 231) he left Alexandria (according to chap. 26)
and took up his residence in Caesarea, leaving his catechetical school in charge of his assistant,
Heraclas. The cause of his departure is stated in chap. 23 to have been "some necessary affairs
of the church " which called him to Greece.
(For a statement of the reasons which lead
me, contrary to the common opinion, to identify the departure mentioned in chap. 23 with

do not know ; but that a visit (to be distinguished from the second visit mentioned in chap. 32 ;
see note 4 on that chapter) was made we know from a fragment of one of Origen's epistles written
from Athens (printed in Lommatzsch's ed. of Origen's works, XXV. p. 388); with which are to
be compared Epiphanius, Haer. LXIV. 1, and the remark made by Eusebius in chap. 16, § 2, in
regard to the finding of a copy of a translation in Nicopolis.
Origen's ordination resulted in
the complete alienation of the bishop Demetrius (upon his earlier and later attitude toward
Origen, and the causes of the change, see below, p. 394 sq.), and he called a council in Alexandria
of bishops and presbyters (the council must have been held very soon after the receipt of the
news of Origen's ordination, for Demetrius died in 232 ; see Bk. V. chap. 22, note 4) which
decided that Origen should be required to leave Alexandria and not be allowed to reside or to
teach there, but did not depose him from the priesthood.
Afterward, however, Demetrius, com

Taking up his abode in Caesarea, Origen made this place his headquarters for the
rest of his life, and found there the most cordial sympathy and support (chap. 27). He carried
on in Caesarea a catechetical school, expounding the Scriptures, lecturing on theology, and at the
same time continuing his literary labors in peace until the persecution of Maximinus (A.D. 235237), during which some of his friends in Caesarea suffered (see chaps. 27, 28, 30, 32, and 36).

His correspondence with the Emperor Philip and his wife is mentioned by Eusebius

the persecution, in the seventieth year of his age (see Bk. VII. chap. 1), at Tyre, and was buried
there (Jerome, de vir. is/. c. 54).

Origen was without doubt the greatest scholar and the most original thinker of his age. He
was at the same time a man of most devout piety, and employed all his wonderful talents in the
service of what he believed to be the truth.
His greatest labors were in the field of exegesis,

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS.

The philosophical and theological works known to us are the two books On the Resurrection
(see chap. 24, note 5): the De principiis (see ibid, note 6); and the Stromata (see ibid, note 7).

Origen's great apologetic work is his Contra Celsum (see chap. 36, note 3).
Two works of a practical character are known to us: On Martyrdom (see chap. 28, note 3);
and On Prayer. The latter work is not mentioned by Eusebius in his History, but is referred to
in Pamphilus' Apology for Origen, Chap. VIII. (Lommatzsch, XXIV. p. 397).
It is extant in the
original Greek, and is printed by Lommatzsch, XVII. p. 79-297.
It is addressed to two of his
friends, Ambrosius and Tatiana, and is one of his most beautiful works. As to the date at which
Origen wrote the work, we know (from chap. 23 of the work) only that it was written after the
composition of the commentary on Genesis (see above, Bk. VI. chap. 24), but whether before
or after his departure from Alexandria we cannot tell.

Of his epistles only two are preserved entire, one to Julius Africanus, and another to Gregory
Thaumaturgus. On the former, see chap. 31, note 1. On the latter and on Origen's other
epistles, see chap. 36, note 7.

On Bk. VI. chap. 8, § 5 (note 4). Origen and Demetrius.
The friendship of Demetrius for Origen began early and continued, apparently without inter
ruption, for many years.
In 203 he committed to him the charge of the catechetical school
(chap. 3); in the present chapter we find him encouraging him after learning of his rash deed ;
some years afterward, upon Origen's return from a visit to Rome, where his fame as a teacher had
already become very great, Demetrius still showed the very best spirit toward him (chap. 14);
and a little later sent him into Arabia to give instruction to an officer in that country (chap. 19).
It is soon after this that the first sign of a difference between the two men appears, upon the
occasion of Origen's preaching in Caesarea (ibid.). There seems, however, to have been no lasting
quarrel, if there was any quarrel at all; for in 231 we find Demetrius giving Origen letters of
recommendation upon the occasion of his visit to Achaia (see below, p. 396). The fact that
he gives him these letters, thus recognizing him as a member of his church in good standing, and
sending him upon his important mission with his official approval, shows that no open break
between himself and Origen can as yet have taken place.
But in his commentary on John (Tom.
VI. praes.) Origen shows us that his last years in Alexandria were by no means pleasant ones.
He compares his troubles there to the waves of a stormy sea, and his final departure to the exodus
of the children of Israel. We know that he had been engaged for some time in writing commen
taries, and that the first five books of his commentary on John - epoch-making in their signifi
cance, and sure to cause a sensation in orthodox, conservative circles - had recently appeared.
We know that his reputation for heterodoxy was already quite widespread and that the majority
of the Egyptian clergy were by no means upon his side. The trials to which he refers, therefore,
may well have been a result of this hostility to his teachings existing among the clergy about him,
and Demetrius may have shared to an extent in the common feeling.
At the same time his dis
approval cannot have been very pronounced, or he could not have given his official sanction to
Origen's important visit to Achaia.
But now, things being in this condition, Origen set out upon
his mission, leaving Heraclas in charge of his school, and undoubtedly with the expectation of
returning again, for he left the unfinished sixth book of his commentary on John behind him (see
preface to the sixth book). He stopped in Palestine on his way to Athens, and there was ordained
a presbyter by the bishops of that country (upon the motives which prompted him in the matter,
see below, p. 397). The result was a complete break between Demetrius and himself, and his
condemnation by an Alexandrian synod. To understand Demetrius' action in the matter, we
must remember that both Eusebius and Jerome attribute the change in his attitude to jealousy of

jealousy led him to attack Origen, or to seek to undermine his influence, and we have no right
to accuse him, without ground, of such unchristian conduct. At the same time, while he remained,
as he supposed, an honest friend of Origen's, the least feeling of jealousy (and it would have been
remarkable had he never felt the least) would make him more suspicious of the latter's conduct,
and more prone to notice in his actions anything which might be interpreted as an infringement
of his own prerogatives, or a disregard of the full respect due him. We seem to see a sign of
this over-sensitiveness (most natural under the circumstances) in his severe disapproval of Origen's
preaching in Caesarea, which surprised the Palestinian bishops, but which is not surprising when
we realize that Demetrius might so easily construe it as a token of growing disrespect for his

state of mind, that he might in all sincerity have given letters of recommendation to Origen and
have wished him God speed upon his mission, and yet that the news of his ordination to the
presbyterate by foreign bishops, without his own approval or consent, and indeed in opposition
to his own principles and to ecclesiastical law, should at once arouse his ire, and, by giving occa
sion for what seemed righteous indignation, open the floodgates for all the smothered jealousy of
years.
In such a temper of mind he could not do otherwise than listen willingly to all the accu
sations of heresy against Origen, which were no doubt busily circulated in his absence, and it was
inevitable that he should believe it his duty to take decided steps against a man who was a
heretic, and at the same time showed complete disregard of the rules and customs of the Church,
and of the rights of his bishop. The result was the definitive and final exclusion of Origen
from communion with the Alexandrian church, and his degradation from the office of presbyter
by decree of the Alexandrian synods described above, p. 392 sq.
The two grounds of
the sentence passed by these synods were plainly his irregular ordination to the priesthood
when constitutionally unfit for it (cf. what Eusebius says in this chapter), and his heterodoxy
(cf. e.g. the synodical epistle of the Egyptian bishops given in Mansi's Collect. Concil. IX.
10, and Rufinus'
col. 524, and also Jerome's epistle ad Pammachium et Oceanum, $
Apologi in Hieron. II. 21). That the ordination to the priesthood of one who had mutilated
himself was not universally considered uncanonical in the time of Origen is proved by the fact
that the Palestinian bishops (whom Origen cannot have allowed to remain ignorant of his condi
tion) all united in ordaining him.
But the very fact that they all united (which has perplexed
some scholars) leads us to think that they realized that their action was somewhat irregular, and
hence wished to give it sanction by the participation of a number of bishops. The first canon of
the Council of Nicaea forbids such ordination, and the canon is doubtless but the repetition of an
older one (cf. Apost. Canons, 21 to 24, and see Hefele, Concillengesch. I. p. 377), and yet
Origen's consent to his ordination makes it improbable that there was in force in his time, even
in Alexandria, a canon placing absolute and unconditional clerical disabilities upon such as he.
That the action, however, was considered at least irregular in Alexandria, is proved by the posi
tion taken in the matter by Demetrius; and the fact that he made so much of it leads us to
believe that the synod, called by him, may now have made canon law of what was before only cus
tom, and may have condemned Origen for violating that custom which they considered as binding
Certainly had there been no such custom, and had it not seemed to Demetrius absolutely
as law.
binding, he would have ordained Origen to the priesthood long before.
His ordination in Pales
tine was in violation of what was known to be Demetrius' own principle, and the principle of the
Alexandrian church, even if the principle was not, until this time or later, formulated into a
Canon.

Eusebius gives as the cause of Origen's visit to Greece simply "a pressing necessity in con
nection with ecclesiastical affairs," but Jerome (de vir. isl. c. 54) tells us that it was on account
of heresies which were troubling the churches of Achaia (/ropter ecclesias Achaiae, quae pluri/us

Origen's Visit to Achaia.

THE CHURCH HISTORY OF EU SEBIUS.

consent of Demetrius (xopis rijs toū oiketov ywópons émotorkómov), but this must be regarded as a
mistake (caused perhaps by his knowledge that it was Origen's ordination, which took place during
this trip, that caused Demetrius' anger; for Photius does not say that this statement rests upon
the authority of Pamphilus, but prefaces his whole account with the words &
ré IIáuqixos paprus
kai tropot tradio rot), for Jerome (de vir. is/. c. 54) says that Origen went to Athens by way of
Palestine sub testimonio ecclesiastica epistolae, and in chap. 62 he says that Alexander, bishop
of Jerusalem wrote an epistle in which he stated that he had ordained Origen juxta testimonium
Demetrii. We must therefore assume that Origen left Alexandria for Athens with Demetrius'
approval, and with letters of recommendation from him.
It is the common opinion that Origen
left Alexandria this time about 228 A.D., and after his visit in Achaia returned to Alexandria,
where he remained until excommunicated by the council called by Demetrius.
Upon searching
the sources, however, I can find absolutely no authority for the statement that he returned to
Alexandria after his visit to Achaia; in fact, that he did seems by most scholars simply to be
taken for granted without further investigation. The opinion apparently rests upon the inter.
pretation of two passages, one in a report of the proceedings of the Alexandrian synod taken by
Photius from Pamphilus' Apology, the other in the preface to the sixth book of Origen's commen.
tary on the Gospel of John.
In the former it is said that the synod voted to exile Origen from
Alexandria, and forbade him to reside or to teach there (lomobićeral peraorroval pov dro "AAéčav
But certainly such a decree is
8pesas rov 'Qptyévmv, kai unjre 8warpiðew év airff, usire 8184.0 kelv).
far from proving that Origen, at the time it was passed, was actually in Alexandria.
It simply
shows that he still regarded that city as his residence, and was supposed to be expecting to
return to it after his visit was completed.
In the preface to the sixth book of his commentary on
John's Gospel, he speaks of the troubles and trials which he had been enduring in Alexandria
before he finally left the city, and compares that departure to the exodus of the children of
Israel.
But certainly it is just as easy to refer these troubles to the time before his visit to
Achaia, a time when in all probability the early books of his commentary on John, as well as
others of his writings, had begun to excite the hostility of the Alexandrian clergy, and thus
made his residence there uncomfortable.
It is almost necessary to assume that this hostility
had arisen some time before the synods were held, in order to account both for the hostility
of the majority of the clergy, which cannot have been so seriously aroused in an instant,
and also for the change in Demetrius' attitude, which must have found a partial cause in the
already existing hostility of the clergy to Origen, hostility which led them to urge him on to take
decisive steps against Origen when the fitting occasion for action came in the ordination of
The only arguments which, so far as I am able to learn,

have been or can be urged for Origen's return to Alexandria are thus shown to prove nothing.
On the other hand, it is a fact that Origen was ordained on his way to Achaia, and then went on
and did his business there, and it is difficult to imagine that Demetrius and the Alexandrian
church would have waited so long before taking action in regard to this step, which appeared to

It
is difficult to imagine that his departure was so hasty that he could not take even his MSS. with
him; but if he left only for his visit to Achaia, expecting to return again, he would of course
leave his MSS. behind him, and when his temporary absence was changed by the synod into
permanent exile, he might not have been in a position, or might not have cared, to send back for
the unfinished work.
Still further, it does not seem probable that, if he were leaving Alexandria
an exile under the condemnation of the church, and in such haste as the leaving of his unfinished
commentary would imply, he should be in a position to entrust the care of his catechetical school

merely on a visit, he would of course leave the school in Heraclas' charge, and after his condem
nation the clergy might see that Heraclas was the man for the place, and leave him undisturbed
in it.
After having, upon the grounds mentioned, reached the conclusion, shared so far as I
knew by no one else, that it is at least unlikely that Origen returned to Alexandria after his
visit to Greece, I was pleased to find my position strengthened by some chronological considera
tions urged by Lipsius (Chronosogie d', röm. Bischöfe, p. 195, note), who says that "we do not
know whether Origen ever returned to Alexandria after his ordination," and who seems to think
it probable that he did not. He shows that Pontianus did not become bishop of Rome until 230,
and therefore, if Eusebius is correct in putting Origen's visit to Achaia in the time of Pontianus'
episcopate, as he does in this passage, that visit cannot have taken place before 230 (the com
monly accepted date, which rests upon a false chronology of Pontianus' episcopate, is 228); while

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES.

on the other hand, according to chap. 26, Origen's final departure from Alexandria took place in
the tenth year of Alexander's reign (231 A.D.), shortly before Demetrius' death, which occurred
not later than 232 (see Bk. V. chap. 22, note 4).
Supposing, then, that Origen returned to
Alexandria, we must assume his journey to Palestine, his ordination there, his visit to Achaia and
settlement of the disputes there, his return to Alexandria, the composition of at least some part of
his commentary on John, the calling of a synod, his condemnation and exile, - all within the

(It may be remarked that Redepenning, who accepts the com

then, that this departure for Achaia is identical with that mentioned in chap. 26, we put it in the
year 231.
It must have been (as of course we should expect, for he stopped in Palestine only
on his way to Achaia) very soon after his departure that Origen's ordination took place; and the
synod must have been called very soon after that event (as we should likewise expect), for Deme
trius died the following year.

As to the cause of Origen's ordination, it is quite possible, as Redepenning suggests, that
when he went a second time to Palestine, his old friends, the bishops of Caesarea, of Jerusalem,
and of other cities, wished to hear him preach again, but that remembering the reproof of the
bishop Demetrius, called forth by his preaching on the former occasion (see chap. 19), he
refused, and that then the Palestinian bishops, in order to obviate that difficulty, insisted on
ordaining him.
It is not impossible that Origen, who seems never to have been a stickler for the
exact observance of minor ecclesiastical rules and formalities, supposed that Demetrius, who had
shown himself friendly in the past, and not hostile to him because of his youthful imprudence
(see chap. 8), would concur willingly in an ordination performed by such eminent bishops, and
an ordination which would prove of such assistance to Origen in the accomplishment of the work
in Achaia which he was undertaking with the approval of Demetrius himself, even though the
latter could not bring himself to violate what he considered an ecclesiastical canon against the
ordination of eunuchs. We can thus best explain Origen's consent to the step which, when we
consider his general character, it is difficult to suppose he would have taken in conscious opposi

was ordained, according to Jerome's de vir. ill. c. 54 (cf. also chap. 8, above), by Theoctistus,
bishop of Caesarea, and Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem, together with "the most distinguished
bishops of Palestine" (as Eusebius says in chap. 8).

length, and the student is referred to their works for a fuller examination of the questions involved.
It is not my purpose here to discuss the various views that have been presented by others; but
inasmuch as I am unable fully to agree with any of them, I desire to indicate my own conception
of the causes that led to the persecution. We are left almost wholly to conjecture in the matter;
for our only authority, Lactantius, makes so many palpably erroneous statements in his descrip
tion of the causes which produced the great catastrophe that little reliance can be placed upon
him (see Burckhardt's demonstration of these errors, ibid. p. 289 sq.).
Nevertheless, he has pre
served for us at least one fact of deep significance, and it is a great merit of Mason's discussion
that he has proved so conclusively the correctness of the report. The fact I refer to is that the
initiative came from Galerius, not from Diocletian himself.
Lactantius states this very distinctly
and repeatedly, but it has been argued by Hunziker and many others that the persecution had
been in Diocletian's mind for a long time, and that it was but the culmination of his entire policy.
Having settled political matters, it is said, he turned his attention to religious matters, and deter
mined as a step toward the restoration of the old Roman religion in its purity to exterminate
Christianity.
It had

and was at length made only under the pressure of strong external reasons.
But though Mason
has brought out this important fact so clearly, and though he has shown that Galerius was the
original mover in the matter, he has, in my opinion, gone quite astray in his explanation of the
causes which led Diocletian to accede to the wishes of Galerius.
According to Mason, Diocle
tian was induced against his will to undertake a course of action which his judgment told him
was unwise. "But the Caesar [Galerius] was the younger and the stronger man; and a determi

broke down so far as to offer to forbid the profession of the faith within the walls of his palace
and under the eagles of his legions. He was sure it was a mistaken policy.
It was certainly
distasteful to himself. The army would suffer greatly by the loss.
Diocletian would have to part
with servants to whom he was attached," &c.
To my mind, it is impossible to believe that
Diocletian - great and wise emperor as he had proved himself, and with an experience of over
eighteen years of imperial power during which he had always shown himself master-can thus
have yielded simply to the importunity of another man. Our knowledge of Diocletian's character
should lead us to repudiate absolutely such a supposition.
Feeling the difficulty of his own sup
position, Mason suggests that Diocletian may have felt that it would be better for him to begin
the persecution himself, and thus hold it within some bounds, than to leave it for Galerius to con

cletian was convinced that the measure was in itself vicious and impolitic, that was a most
remarkable course to pursue. To do a bad thing in order to leave no excuse for a successor
to do the same thing in a worse way - certainly that is hardly what we should expect from
the strongest and the wisest ruler Rome had seen for three centuries.
If he believed it ought
not to be done, we may be sure he would not have done it, and that neither Galerius
nor any one else could compel him to.
He was not such a helpless tool in the hands of
others, nor was he so devoid of resources as to be obliged to prevent a successor's folly and
wickedness by anticipating him in it, nor so devoid of sense as to believe that he could.
It is,
in my opinion, absolutely necessary to assume that Diocletian was convinced of the necessity of
proceeding against the Christians before he took the step he did. How then are we to account

for this change in his opinions?
among the Christians.
But the question naturally arises, what motive can the Christians have
had for forming a plot against an emperor so friendly to them and a government under which
they enjoyed such high honors?
Burckhardt gives no satisfactory answer to this very pertinent
query, and consequently his theory has not found wide acceptance. And yet I believe he is upon
the right track in speaking of a plot, though he has not formed the right conception of its causes
and nature, and has not been able to urge any known facts in direct support of his theory.
In
my opinion the key to the mystery lies in the fact which Lactantius states and the truth of which
Mason demonstrates, but which Burckhardt quite overlooks, that the initiative came from Galerius,
not Diocletian, viewed in the light of the facts that Galerius had long been known to be a bitter
enemy of the Christians, and that he was to succeed Diocletian within a couple of years. The
course of events might be pictured somewhat as follows.
Some of the Christian officials and
retainers of Diocletian, fearing what might happen upon the accession of Galerius, who was known
to be a deadly enemy of the Christians, and who might be expected, if not to persecute, at least
to dismiss all the Christian officials that had enjoyed Diocletian's favor (Galerius himself had
only heathen officials in his court), conceived the idea of frustrating in some way the appointed

succession and secure it for some one who would be more favorable to them (possibly for the
young Constantine, who was then at Diocletian's court, and who, as we know, was later so cor
dially hated by Galerius).
It may have been hoped by some of them that it would be possible in
the end to win Diocletian himself over to the side of Christianity, and then induce him to change
the succession and transmit the power to a fitter prince.
There may thus have been nothing dis
tinctly treasonable in the minds of any of them, but there may have been enough to arouse the
suspicions of Galerius himself, who was the one most deeply interested, and who was always well
aware of the hatred which the Christians entertained toward him. We are told by Lactantius
that Galerius spent a whole winter with Diocletian, endeavoring to persuade him to persecute.
The latter is but a conclusion drawn by Lactantius from the events which followed; for he tells us
himself that their conferences were strictly private, and that no one knew to what they pertained.
But why did the persecution of the Christians at this particular time seem so important a thing to
Galerius that he should make this long and extraordinary visit to Nicomedia? Was it the result
I confess myself unable to believe that Galerius'
of a fresh accession of religious zeal on his part?
piety lay at the bottom of the matter, and at any rate, knowing that he would himself be master
of the empire in two years, why could he not wait until he could take matters into his own hands
and carry them out after his own methods? No one, so far as I know, has answered this ques
tion; and yet it is a very pertinent one.
It might be said that Galerius was afraid that he should
not be able to carry out such measures unless they had had the sanction of his great predecessor.
But Galerius never showed, either as Caesar or Augustus, any lack of confidence in himself, and I
am inclined to think that he would have preferred to enjoy the glory of the great undertaking
himself rather than give it all to another, had he been actuated simply by general reasons of
hostility toward the Church.
But if we suppose that he had conceived a suspicion of such a plan
as has been suggested, we explain fully his remarkable visit and his long and secret interviews with

Diocletian.
(which he might well fancy to be more serious than it really was) than in Nicomedia itself;
and if such a plot was on foot, it was of vital importance to unearth it and reveal it to Diocletian.
We may believe then that Galerius busied himself during the whole winter in investigating
matters, and that long after he had become thoroughly convinced of the existence of a plot
Diocletian remained skeptical.

We may suppose that at the same time whatever vague plans were in the minds of any of the
Christians were crystallizing during that winter, as they began to realize that Galerius' hold upon
the emperor was such that the latter could never be brought to break with him. We may thus
imagine that while Galerius was seeking evidence of a plot, the plot itself was growing and taking
a more serious shape in the minds at least of some of the more daring and worldly minded
Christians.
Finally, sufficient proof was gathered to convince even Diocletian that there was
some sort of a plot on foot, and that the plotters were Christians. The question then arose what
course should be pursued in the matter.
And this question may well have caused the calling
together of a number of counsellors and the consultation of the oracle of Apollo of which
Galerius naturally wished to exterminate the Christians as a whole, knowing

their universal hostility to him; but Diocletian just as naturally wished to punish only such as were
concerned in the plot, and was by no means convinced that the Christians as a whole were
engaged in it. The decision which was reached, and which is exhibited in the edict of the
24th of February, 303, seems to
confirm in a remarkable manner the theory which has

blows solely against Christians in governmental circles, - public officials and servants in official
families (cf. the interpretation of the edict given above in Bk. VIII. chap. 2, note 6).
This is cer
tainly not the procedure of an emperor who is persecuting on religious grounds. The church
officers should in that case have been first attacked as they had been by Decius and Valerian.
The singling out of Christians in official circles - and the low as well as the high ones, the
servants as well as the masters-is a clear indication that the motive was political, not religious.

were certainly not all guilty, and it was not necessary to put them all to death.
It was necessary to
put an end to the plot in the most expeditious and complete way. The plotters should be shown
that their plot was discovered, and the whole thing should be broken up by causing some of them

caused the plot to spread.
But Diocletian was well aware that any one that renounced his faith
would lose caste with his fellow-Christians, and even if he had been a plotter in the past, he could
never hope to gain anything in the future from the accession of a Christian emperor. He was

careful moreover to provide against any danger from those who refused to renounce their faith, by put
ting them into a position where it would be impossible for them to accomplish anything in that line in
the future. He knew that a plot which had no support within official circles would be of no account
and was not to be feared. The action, based on the grounds given, was worthy of Diocletian's gen
ius; explained in any other way it becomes, in my opinion, meaningless. A further confirmation
of the view which has been presented is found in the silence of Lactantius and Eusebius. The
former was in Nicomedia, and cannot have failed to know the ostensible if not the true cause of

the great persecution.
it, and doubtless that reason was stated in the preambles of his edicts, as is the case in the
edicts of other emperors; but as it happens, while we know the substance of all the edicts, not
a single preamble has been preserved. May it not be possible that the Christians, who preserved
the terms of the edicts, found the preambles distasteful because derogatory to some of themselves
and yet unfortunately not untrue? The reasons which Lactantius gives are palpable makeshifts,
and indeed he does not venture to state them categorically. "I have learned," he says, "that
the cause of his fury was as follows."
Doubtless he had heard it thus in Christian circles; but
doubtless he had heard it otherwise from heathen or from the edicts themselves; and he can
hardly, as a sensible man, have been fully satisfied with his own explanation of the matter.
Eusebius attempts no explanation. He tells us in chapter 1, above, that the Church just before
the persecution was in an abominable state and full of unworthy Christians, and yet he informs
us that he will pass by the unpleasant facts to dwell upon the brighter side for the edification of
posterity. Was the cause of the persecution one of the unpleasant facts? He calls it a judgment
of God. Was it a merited judgment upon some who had been traitors to their country? He
gives us his opinion as to the causes of the persecution of Decius and Valerian ; why is he
silent about the causes of this greatest of all the persecutions? His silence in the present case is
eloquent.

The course of events after the publication of the First Edict is not difficult to follow.

Fire
broke out twice in the imperial palace.
Lactantius ascribes it to Galerius, who was supposed to have
desired to implicate the Christians; but, as Burckhardt remarks, Diocletian was not the man to be
deceived in that way, and we may dismiss the suspicion as groundless. That the fires were accidental
is possible, but extremely improbable.
Diocletian at least believed that they were kindled by
Christians, and it must be confessed that he had some ground for his belief. At any rate, whether
true or not, the result was the torture (for the sake of extorting evidence) and the execution of
some of his most faithful servants (see Bk. VIII. chap. 6).
It had become an earnest matter
with Diocletian, and he was beginning to feel - as he had never had occasion to feel before - that
a society within the empire whose claims were looked upon as higher than those of the state
itself, and duty to which demanded, in case of a disagreement between it and the state, insub
ordination, and even treason, toward the latter, was too dangerous an institution to tolerate
longer, however harmless it might be under ordinary circumstances.
It was at about this time
that there occurred rebellions in Melitene and Syria, perhaps in consequence of the publication
of the First Edict; at any rate, the Christians, who were regarded with ever increasing suspicion,
were believed to be in part at least responsible for the outbreaks, and the result was that a
second edict was issued, commanding that all the rulers of the churches should be thrown into

Valerian, and instituted thereby a genuine religious persecution.
It was now Christians as Chris
tians whom he attacked ; no longer Christian officials as traitors. The vital difference between
the first and second edicts is very clear.
All that followed was but the legitimate carrying out of
the principle adopted in the Second Edict, - the destruction of the Church as such, the extermi
nation of Christianity.

After Constantine's victory over Maxentius, his half-sister Constantia, daughter of Constantius
Chlorus by his second wife, Theodora, was married to Licinius, and thus the alliance of the two
emperors was cemented by family ties.
Constantius Chlorus was a grandson of Crispus, brother
of the Emperor Claudius II., and hence could claim to be, in a sense, of imperial extraction; a

TABLES.- BISHOPS OF ROME.

4O1

A LIST OF THE BISHOPS OF ROME, MENTion ED BY Eusebius; witH THEIR DATES.

In the following Table the names in the first column are according to the order adopted by Eusebius
with a reference to the chapter in his Ecclesiastical History where their accession is noted.
In col. 2
the Date of Accession is given according to the computation from the Ecclesiastical History made by Clinton
in his Chronology (p. 467). The Duration of Years in col. 3 is that given by Eusebius.

The Dates of Accession and Duration according to Eusebius' Chronicle (cols. 4 and 5), and differing

considerably srom those of his Ecclesiastical History, also follow Clinton's Chronology (p. 467).

The Duration of Years from the early Liberian Catalogues (col. 6) follows the edition of Bucher (printed
by Migne, Patrol., vol. cxxvii., col. 119-122). The various readings, however, derived from different MSS.,
and revision by Editors are extremely numerous.
Moreover, scarcely one of the entries as given by Bucher
professedly from early Vatican MSS., agrees with that representing the same Bishop of Rome in either of
the early Corbey MSS., printed by Mabillon in his Vetera Analecta (Paris, 1723, pp. 218, 219).

The Durations of each Episcopate according to Anastasius (col. 7) follow Migne's Edition of that Author

(Patrol. vol. cxxvii. col. 1003-1512, and vol. cxxviii. col. 9-19).

These are also subject to various readings.

It will at once be seen how confused is the state of the chronology of the Early Bishops of Rome.
The eighth column gives the dates as revised by comparison of various data, and adapted to his general

system of Chronology by Clinton (Chronology, ed. 1853, pp. 465, 466).

TABLES.--ROMAN MONTHS.

4O3

THE ROMAN MONTHS.

The first day of each month was named "THE KALENDs, because on that day people were
summoned (calare = Gr. kaxeiv) by the Pontifex, and the commencement of the month was
announced together with other matters in connection with the Kalendar.

The fifth day of Jan., Feb., April, June, Aug., Sept., and Dec. (and the seventh day of March,
May, July, and October) was named "THE NoNES,' because it was the ninth day, inclusive,
before the Ides.

-

The thirteenth day of Jan., Feb., April, June, Aug., Sept., and Dec. (and the fifteenth day
of March, May, July, and October) was named "THE IDEs ' (the word supposed to come from an
old Etruscan verb iduare = to divide).

The mode of reckoning the intermediate days, however, was backwards. The second day
of the month would be called the fourth (or sixth as the case might be) before the Mones of
that month.

So also the eighth day of the month would be called the sixth (or the eighth as the case

might be) before the Ides of that month.

And so again the sixteenth of the month would be called the seventeenth (or the fourteenth

or the sixteenth as the case might be) before the Kalends of the month following.

It may, however, be added that there are anomalies in the writing of the date in Latin which sometimes tend
to obscure it. The words are seldom, if ever, written in full, and /// A'al. Feb. (i.e., tertio Kalendas Februarias)
would be found, rather than tertio die ante Kalendas Februarias, for the 3oth day of January : the word die being
understood, and ante being omitted before Aalendas, Monas, and Idus. A further complication ensues in the
common form for the same of a. d. 1// Kal. Feb., i.e., ante diem tertium A'alendas Februarias, which form can only
be explained by supposing the ante to have for some reason changed its place, and the ablative (die tertio) turned
at the same time into the accusative, producing the false appearance of the diem being governed by the ante.

PRO LEGO MENA.

I. CONSTANTINE THE GREAT.

PRE FA C E.

IN accordance with the instruction of the editor-in-chief the following work consists of a revis
ion of the Bagster translation of Eusebius' "Life of Constantine," Constantine's "Oration to the
Saints," and Eusebius' "Oration in Praise of Constantine," with somewhat extended Prolegomena
and limited notes, especial attention being given in the Prolegomena to a study of the Character
of Constantine.
In the work of revision care has been taken so far as possible not to destroy the
style of the original translator, which, though somewhat inflated and verbose, represents perhaps
all the better, the corresponding styles of both Eusebius and Constantine, but the number of
changes really required has been considerable, and has caused here and there a break in style in
the translation, whose chief merit is that it presents in smooth, well-rounded phrase the gener
alized idea of a sentence. The work on the Prolegomena has been done as thoroughly and
originally as circumstances would permit, and has aimed to present material in such way that the
general student might get a survey of the man Constantine, and the various problems and discus
sions of which he is center.
It is impossible to return special thanks to all who have given special
facilities for work, but the peculiar kindness of various helpers in the Bib/iothèque de la I is/e at
Lyons demands at least the recognition of individualized thanksgiving.

CHAPTER I.

LIFE."

§ 1.

Early Years.

THE Emperor Flavius Valerius Constantinus, surnamed the Great," born February 27, 272 or
274," at Naissus," was son of Constantius Chlorus, afterwards Emperor," and Helena his wife."
He was brought up at Drepanum, his mother's home,' where he remained until his father became

1 This sketch of the life of Constantine is intended to give the
thread of events, and briefly to supplement, especially for the earlier
part of his reign, the life by Eusebius, which is distinctly confined
to his religious acts and life.

* "Imperator Caesar Augustus Consul Proconsul Pontifex Max
imus, Magnus, Maximus, Pius, Felix, Fidelis, Mansuetus, Benificus,
Clementissimus, Victor, Invictus, Triumphator, Salus Reip. Beti
cus, Alemanicus, Gothicus, Sarmarticus, Germanicus, Britannicus,
Hunnicus, Gallicanus," is a portion of his title, as gathered from
coins, inscriptions, and various documents.

* Calendarium Rom. in Petavius Uranal. p. 113.

The date
varies by a year or two, according to way of reckoning, but 274 is
(Cf. Burckhardt, Manso, Keim, De Broglie,
the date usually given.
Wordsworth, etc.)
Eutropius and Hieronymus say he died in his
sixty-sixth year, Theophanes says he was sixty-five years old, and
Socrates and Sozomen say substantially the same, while Victor,
Epit. has sixty-three, and Victor, Cars. sixty-two.
Eusebius says
he lived twice the length of his reign, i.e. 63 +.

a reason.

Manso chose 274, because it agreed best with the representations
of the two Victors as over against the "later church historians."
But the two Victors say, one that he lived sixty-two years and
reigned thirty-two, and the other that he lived sixty-three and reigned
thirty; while Eutropius, secretary to Constantine, gives length of
reign correctly, and so establishes a slight presumption in favor
Moreover, it is supported by Hieronymus,
of his other statement.
whose testimony is not of the highest quality, to be sure, and is
quite likely taken from Eutropius, and Theophanes, who puts the
same fact in another form, and who certainly chose that figure for
The statement of Eusebius is a very elastic generaliza
tion, and is the only support of Victor, EArt. Socrates, who, accord
ing to Wordsworth, says he was in his sixty-fifth year, uses the
idiom "mounting upon " (&n obas) sixty-five years, which at the
least must mean nearly sixty-five years old, and unless there is some
well-established usage to the contrary, seems to mean having lived
already sixty-five years.
In the interpretation of Sozomen (also
given in translation "in his sixty-fifth year") he was "about"
sixty-five years old. Now if he died in May, his following birthday
would not have been as "about," and he must have been a little
over sixty-five. This would make a strong consensus against Victor,
against whom Eutropius alone would have a presumption of accu
racy. On the whole it may be said that in the evidence, so far as
cited by Manso, Wordsworth, Clinton, and the run of historians,
there is no critical justification for the choice of the later date and
the shorter life.

" It has been a much discussed question, whether Helena was
legitimate wife or not. Some (Zosimus 2.8; Niceph. Callist. 7. 18)
have asserted that Helena was a woman "indifferent honest," and
the birth of Constantine illegitimate. This view is simply psycho
logically impossible regarding a woman of so much and such strength
of character.
That she stood in the relation of legitimate concu
binage (cf. Smith and Cheetham, Dict. 1. 422) is not improbable,
since many (Hieron. Orosius, Zosimus 2, 8; Chron. Pasch. p. 516,
and others) assert this lesser relationship.
This would have been
not unlike a modern morganatic marriage. The facts are: 1. That
she is often spoken of as concubine (cf. above).
2. That she is
distinctly called wife, and that by some of the most competent
authorities (Eutrop. 10. 2; Anon. Wales. p. 471; Euseb. H. E.8. 13:
Ephraem p. 21, etc.), also in various inscriptions (compare collected
inscriptions in Clinton 2. 81).
3. That she was divorced (Anon.
Vales. p. 47). The weight of testimony is clearly in favor of the
word "wise," though with divorce so easy it seems to have been a
name only. The view that she was married in the full legal sense,
but only after the birth of Constantine, is plausible enough, and has
a support more apparent than real, in the fact that he "first estab
lished that natural children should be made legitimate by the sub
sequent marriage of their parents" (Sandars Inst. Żust. (1865) 113;
cf. Cod. Just. V. xxvii. 1 and 5 ed. Krueger 2 (1877) 216).

Of course the story of her violation by and subsequent marriage
to Constantius (Inc. auct. ed. Heydenreich) is purely legendary,
and the same may be said of the somewhat circumstantial account
of her relation as concubine, given by Nicephorus Callistus 7,

Caesar (A.D. 292 acc. to Clinton) and divorced Helena (Anon. Wales. p. 471). He was then sent
to the court of Diocletian, nominally to be educated (Praxagoras, in Müller, Fragm. 4 (1868);

Anon. Metroph., Theoph. p. 10)."
Shortly after joining the emperor he contracted (296 or 297) his alliance with Minervina," by
whom he had a son, Crispus." He was at Nicomedia when Diocletian's palace was struck by
lightning (Const. Orat. 35), and was present at the abdication of Diocletian and Maximinus in 305
(Lact. De M. P. c. 18 sq.).
This last event proved a crisis for Constantine. He had grown to
be a man of fine physique (Lact. c. 18; Euseb. V. C. I. 19), of proved courage and military skill
(cf. remarks on physical characteristics under Character), and a general favorite (Lact. l.c.). He
had already "long before " (Lact. c. 18) been created Tribune of the first order.
It was both
natural and fitting that at this time he should become Caesar in the place of his father, who became
Augustus.
Every one supposed he would be chosen (c. 19), and Diocletian urged it (c. 18), but
the princely youth was too able and illustrious to please Galerius, and Constantine was set aside for
obscure, and incompetent men (cf. Lact.).
His brilliant
parts naturally aroused the jealousy and suspicions of the emperors.
They, or at least Galerius,
even sought his death, it is said, by tempting him to fight wild beasts (a lion, Praxag. p. 3; cf.
Zonaras 2, p. 623), or exposing him to special danger in battle (cf. Philistog. I. 6; Lact. c. 24;
Anon. Vales. p. 471 ; Theophanes p. 10-12, &c.). The situation, hard enough before, now became,
we may well believe, intolerable. He was humiliated, handicapped, and even in danger of his life.
He was practically a prisoner. The problem was, how to get away.
Several times Constantius
asked that his son might be allowed to join him, but in vain (Lact. c. 24; Anon. Vales. p. 471).
It was given at night, and

making the journey.
Each relay of post horses which he left was maimed to baffle pursuit
(Anon. Wales., Vict. Epit. p. 49 ; cf. Lact. c. 24, Praxag. p. 3). The rage of the emperor when he
learned of the flight was great but vain.
Constantine was already out of reach, and soon joined
his father at Bononia (Boulogne, Anon. Vales. ; cf. Eumen. Paneg. (31 oy, c. 7)," just in time to
accompany him on his final expeditions to Britain (Eumen. Paneg. (310) c. 7 ; cf. Anon. Vales.

Constantine as his successor (Euseb. V. C. 1. 21 ; Eumen. Paneg. (31o) c. 7. ; Lact. c. 24).

His position was far from easy before.

that he be sent back to him (Lact., Anon. Vales. p. 471), and the as the only argument against, is reduced to a minimum in view
of Constantine's law for the legitimization of natural children by
whole story of his final flight. So also it is said by Anon. Wales.

p. 49-50), he sent his portrait to Galerius, claiming the title of Augustus.
This the emperor
refused to grant, but, much against his will, allowed him to have the title of Caesar (Lact. c. 25).
Constantine did not insist on his right to the greater title, but waited his time, and in the interim
contented himself with the lesser, - as the coins show." There was enough to do.
After his
father's death he waged war against the Francs, and later against the Bructeri and others (Eutrop.
1c. 3; Paneg. (307) c. 4; Eumen. Paneg. (310) co. 10-12 ; Nazar. Paneg. (321) 18; Euseb.
W. C. 1. 25, &c.; cf. Inscr. ap. Clinton 2. 93), and celebrated his victories by exposing his captives
to the wild beasts (Eutrop. Io. 3.; Eumen. Paneg. (31o) c. 12; Paneg. (313) c. 23; cf. Nazar.
Paneg. (321) c. 16).

Meanwhile affairs were marching at Rome, too. The same year (306) that Constantine was
elected Augustus by the soldiers, Maxentius at Rome was proclaimed emperor by the Pretorian
Guards (Eutrop. Io. 2 ; Vict. Caes. p. 156; Anon. Wales. p. 472 ; Zos. 2. 9; Socr. 1. 2; Oros. c. 26,
&c.; Lact. c. 26). He persuaded the willing (Eutrop. Io. 2) Maximian to resume the imperial
purple (Lact. c. 26; Zos. 2. Io), but soon quarreled with him (Socr. 1. 2; Eutrop. Io. 3; Zos. 2.
In 307 Constantine and Maximinus were named "sons of the emperors," and
11; Lact. c. 28)."
the following year were reluctantly acknowledged as emperors by Galerius.
Maximian, after he
had quarreled with his son, betook himself to Gaul and made alliance with Constantine by giving
his daughter Fausta in marriage (307). He proved an uncomfortable relative. The much-abused

tried to supersede Constantine by corrupting his soldiers.
At his persuasion Constantine had left
behind the bulk of his army while he made a campaign on the frontier. As soon as he was sup
posably out of the way, the soldiers were won by largesses, and Maximian assumed the purple
again.
Constantine acted with decisive promptness,
returned by such rapid marches that he caught Maximian entirely unprepared (Lact. c. 29) and
drove him into Marseilles, where the latter cursed him vigorously from the walls (Lact. c. 29), but
was able to offer no more tangible resistance. The gates were thrown open (Lact. c. 29), and
Maximian was in the power of Constantine, who this time spared his precious father-in-law."
Grateful for this mildness, Maximian then plotted to murder him. The plan was for Fausta to
leave her husband's door open and for Maximian to enter and kill Constantine with his own hands.
Fausta pretended to agree, but told her husband (Zos. 2. 11; Joh. Ant. p. 603; Oros. c. 28), who
put a slave in his own place (but apparently did not "put himself in the place of" the slave),
had the program been carried out, and catching Maximian in the act, granted him that supreme
ancient mercy, - the right to choose how he would die (Lact. c. 30)."

But he had reckoned without his host.

Though in the midst of wars and plots, and liable at any time to have to run from one end of
his province to the other to put down some insurrection, Constantine kept steadily at the work of
internal improvement, organizing the interior, fortifying the boundaries, building bridges, restor

ing cities, building up educational institutions, &c."
At the end of five years' reign (July 24,
311) he had reduced the turbulent tribes, organized his affairs, and endeared himself to his peo
ple, especially to the Christians, whom he had favored from the first (Lact. c. 24), and who
could hardly fail in those days of persecution to rejoice in a policy such as is indicated in his letter
to Maximinus Daza in behalf of persecuted Christians (Lact. c. 37).

§ 3.

State of Affairs in 311.

In the meantime, while the extreme west of the empire was enjoying the mild rule of Con
stantine, the other corners of the now quadrangular and now hexagonal world, over which during
this time Maximinus, Galerius, Licinius, Maximian, and Maxentius had tried to reign, had had a

wanted that of some one else or feared that some one else wanted his.
In order clearly to
understand Constantine, a glimpse of the state of affairs in these other parts of the empire, together
with some idea of the kind of men with whom he had to deal is essential, and may be gotten from
a brief view of (1) The rulers, (2) Characters of the rulers, (3) Condition of the ruled.

(1) The Rulers.
The intricate process of evolution and devolution of emperors, mysterious to the uninitiated
as a Chinese puzzle, is briefly as follows: In 305 Diocletian and Maximian had abdicated (Lact.
c. 18; Eutrop. 9. 27; Vict. Caes.), Galerius and Constantius succeeding as Augusti and Severus,
In 306 Constantius died, Constan
Maximinus Daza succeeding them as Caesars (Lact. c. 19).
tine was proclaimed Augustus by his army, Maxentius by the Pretorian Guards (cf. above), and
Severus by Galerius (Lact. c. 25), while Maximian resumed the purple (see above) - four
emperors, Galerius, Severus, Maximian, and Maxentius, with two Caesars, Constantine and Max
iminus, one with a pretty definite claim to the purple, and the other bound not to be left out in
the cold.
In 307 Licinius was appointed Augustus by Galerius (Lact. c. 29; Vict. Caes., Zos.
2. 1 1 ; Anon. Vales. ; Eutrop. Io. 4), who also threw a sop to Cerberus by naming Constantine
and Maximin "sons of emperors" (Lact. c. 32 ; Coins in Eckhel 8 (1838) 52.3).
Constantine
was given title of Augustus by Maximianus (?), and Maximinus about this time was forced, as he
said, by his army to assume the title.
Meantime the growing procession of emperors was reduced
by one.
Severus, sent against Maxentius, was deserted by his soldiers, captured, and slain in
307 (Lact. c. 26; Zos. 2. Io; Anon. Vales. ; Eutrop. Io. 2 ; Vict. Caes. &c. &c.), leaving still
six emperors or claimants, - Galerius, Licinius, Maxentius, Maximian, Maximinus, and Constan
tine.
In 308, making the best of a bad matter, Galerius appointed Constantine and Maximin
Augusti (see above), leaving the situation unchanged, and so it remained until the death of
Maximian in 31 o (see above), and of Galerius in May, 311 (Lact. c. 33; Vict. Caes., Vict. Epit.,
Zos. 2. 11) reduced the number to four.

-

(2) Characters of the Rulers.
Constantine's own character has been hinted at and will be studied later.

Severus was the
least significant of the others, having a brief reign and being little mentioned by historians. Dio
cletian's characterization of him was, according to Lactantius (c. 18), as ejaculated to Galerius,
"That dancing, carousing drunkard who turns night into day and day into night." The average
character of the other emperors was that of the prisoners for life in our modern state prisons.
Galerius, "that pernicious wild beast" (Lact. c. 25), was uneducated, drunken (Anon. Wales.
p. 472), fond of boasting himself to be the illegitimate son of a dragon (Lact. 9; Vict. Epit.
p. 49), and sanguinary and ferocious to an extraordinary degree (Lact. c. 9. 21, 22, &c.).
Licinius, characterized by "ingratitude" and "cold-blooded ferocity," was "not only totally

indifferent to human life and suffering, and regardless of any principle of law or justice which
might interfere with the gratification of his passions, but he was systematically treacherous and
cruel, possessed of not one redeeming quality save physical courage and military skill" (Ramsay,
in Smith Dict. 2, p. 784; compare Euseb. H. E. 10.8; V. C. 1.49-56), and "in avaricious cupidity
worst of all " (Vict. Epit. p. 51).
Maximinus' character "stands forth as pre-eminent for brutal
licentiousness and ferocious cruelty-‘lust hard by hate'" (Plumptre, in Smith & W. 3, p. 872),
and according to Lactantius, c. 38, "that which distinguished his character and in which he tran
scended all former emperors was his desire of debauching women." He was cruel, superstitious,
gluttonous, rapacious, and "so addicted to intoxication that in his drunken frolics he was frequently
deranged and deprived of his reason like a madman" (Euseb. H. E. 8. 14).
Maximianus has been
thought to be on the whole the least outrageous, and his somewhat defective moral sense
respecting treachery and murder has been noted (cf. above). He has been described as "thor
oughly unprincipled .
He is described
. . base and cruel" (Ramsay, in Smith Dict. 2, p. 981).

said (Tyrwhitt, in Smith & W. 3, p. 865): "His wickedness seems to have transcended descrip
tion, and to have been absolutely unredeemed by any saving feature." He "left no impurity or
licentiousness untouched " (Euseb. H. E. 8. 14; cf. Eutrop. Io. 4; Lact. 9). He was marked
by "impiety," "cruelty," "lust," and tyranny (Paneg. [313] c. 4). He was the most disrepu

historians, from whom such strong statements are mainly drawn, yet enough of the details are
confirmed by Victor, Epif., the Panegyrists, Eutropius, and other non-Christian writers to verify
the substantial facts of the ferocity, drunkenness, lust, covetousness, and oppression of this precious
galaxy of rulers.

(3) Condition of the Ruled.
Under such rulers there was a reign of terror during this period which contrasted strangely
with the state of things under Constantine.
Galerius was "driving the empire wild with his taxa
tions" (cf. Lact. c. 23 and 26), affording in this also a marked contrast with the course of Con
stantine in Gaul.
Maxentius led in the unbridled exercise of passion (Euseb. H. E. 8. 14; cf.
Lact. c. 18), but in this he differed from the others little except in degree (compare Euseb.
V. C. 1.55 on Licinius), and according to Lactantius (c. 28) he was surpassed by Maximin.
In brief, all did according to their own sweet wills, and the people had to stand it as best they
could. The worst was that the oppression did not end with the emperors nor the friends and
officials to whom they delegated power to satisfy their desires at the expense of the helpless.
Their armies were necessary to them. The soldiers had to be conciliated and exactions made
to meet their demands. They followed the examples of their royal leaders in all manner of
excesses and oppressions. No property or life or honor was safe.

The persecution of the Christians reached a climax of horror in this period. The beginning
of the tenth persecution was, to be sure, a little before this (303), but its main terror was in this
time.
Galerius and Maximian are said indeed to have persecuted less during this period, and
Maxentius not at all ; but Galerius was the real author and sanguinary promoter of the persecution
which is ascribed to Diocletian (Lact. c. 11), while Maximian was, in 304, the author of the
celebrated "Fourth Edict" which made death the penalty of Christianity, and Maxentius was
only better because impartial-he persecuted both Christian and heathen (Euseb. P. C. 1.
33-6; H. E. 8. 14; Eutrop. Io. 4)." The persecution under Maximin was of peculiar atrocity
(Euseb. H. E. 8. 17; 9. 6, &c.; Lact. c. 26-27), so that the whole of this period in the East,
excepting a slight breathing space in 308, was a terror to Christians, and it is said that "these
two years were the most prolific of bloodshed of any in the whole history of Roman persecu

* "Raging against the nobles with every kind of destruction," Eutrop. 10.4.

PROLEGOMENA.

tions" (Marriott, in Smith & W. 2, p. 594).
It was not until the very end of this period' that
Galerius, in terror of death, issued the famous first edict of toleration." Such was the condition
of things in July, 311. The deaths of Severus in 307, Maximian in 31 o, and Galerius in 31 1, had
cleared the stage so far as to leave but four Augusti, Licinius and Maximin in the East, Constantine
and Maxentius in the West. The only well-ordered and contented section of the world was that
of Constantine.
In all the others there was oppression, excess, and discontent, the state of things
at Rome being on the whole the most outrageous.

§ 4.

Second Five Years.
This period was most momentous for the world's history.

war against Constantine, found it in a pretended desire to avenge his father (Zos. 2. 14), and pre

mind was prepared. He was alert and ready to act. He gathered all the forces, German, Gallic,
and British (Zos. 2. 15) that he could muster, left a portion for the protection of the Rhine,
entered Italy by way of the Alps (Paneg.), and marched to meet the much more numerous
forces of Maxentius, - Romans, Italians, Tuscans, Carthagenians, and Sicilians (Zos. 2. 15)."
First Sigusium was taken by storm (Naz. Paneg. [321] c. 17 and 21 ; Paneg. [313] c. 5); then
the cavalry of Maxentius was defeated at Turin (Naz. Paneg. [321] c. 22 ; Paneg. [313] c. 6).
After a few days' rest in Milan (Paneg. [313] c. 7) he continued his triumphant march, defeating
the enemy again in a cavalry engagement at Brescia (Naz. Paneg. c. 25), and taking the strongly
fortified Verona after a hard-fought battle before the walls (Anon. Vales. p. 473; Paneg. [313];
Naz. Paneg. c. 25-26).
This had taken him out of his way a little; but now there were no

fired by his own energy and the sight of the cross. The defeat was a rout. The bridge broke.
Maxentius, caught in the jam, was cast headlong into the river (Anon. Val. p. 473; Lact. c. 44;
Chron. Pasch. p. 521, &c.); and after a vain attempt to climb out on the steep bank opposite

head cut off (Praxag. ; Anon. Vales. p. 473), and carried into the city (Anon. Vales. p. 473) on
the point of a spear (Paneg.[313] c. 18; Zos. 2. 17; Praxag. p. 1). Constantine entered the city

it is probable that the philanthropic motive was his justification and
pretext to his own conscience for the attempt to rid himself of this
suspected and dangerous neighbor. Zosimus being Zosimus, it is
probable that Maxentius was the aggressor if he says so.

* Eusebius represents the occasion of Constantine's movement
as a philanthropic compassion for the people of Rome (V. C. 1.26;
H. E. 9.9).

Praxagoras (ed. Müller, p. 1) says

Constantine then returned to Gaul (Anon. Vales. p. 473; Zos. 11. 17), where he
was forced into another sort of strenuous warfare - the ecclesiastical, taking a hand somewhat
against his will in trying to settle the famous Donatist schism."

Licinius had a more critical problem to meet.

Maximin thought it a good time to strike
while Licinius was off in Milan engaged in festivities (Lact. c. 45); but the latter, hastily gather
ing his troops and pushing on by forced marches, met near Heraclea and utterly defeated him
(Lact. c. 46).
Maximin fled precipitately, escaping the sword only to die a more terrible death
that same summer (Lact. c. 49 ; Euseb. P. C. I. 58; cf. Zos. 2. 17)." The death of Maximin

They, too, promptly fell out. The next year they were at war.

Causes and pretexts were
various ; but the pretext, if not the cause, was in general that Licinius proved an accomplice after

Whatever the immediate cause, it was one of

Apart
from the mutilation made for the glory of Constantine, it is a noble
piece of work. The changes made were artistic disfigurements; but
art's loss is science's gain, and for the historian it is most interesting.
The phrase "instinctu divinitatis" has its value in the "Hoc

certain things, it seems to have been disproved. The "harder edict"
seems to have been a product of Eusebius' rather slovenly historical
method, and to refer to the first, or Galerian edict.

* The appeal of the Donatists to Constantine was first met by the
appointment of a "court of enquiry," held at Rome, Oct. 2, 313.
The result was unsatisfactory, and Constantine ordered an examina
tion on the spot, which took place at Carthage, Feb. 15, 314 (Phil

lott). The Donatists still urging, the Council of Arles was called,
Aug. 1, 314, and some progress seemed to be made, but progress
more satisfactory to the orthodox than to the schismatics, who urged
again that Constantine hear the matter himself, as he finally did, No

firmed the previous findings, and took vigorous but ineffective meas
ures to suppress the Donatists, measures which he saw afterwards
could not be carried out, and perhaps saw to be unjust. Compare
Augustine, Ep. 43, ch. 2, and elsewhere, also various documents
from Augustine, Lactantius, Eusebius, Optatus, &c., collected in
Migne, Patz o.o. Lat. 8 (1844), 673-784.

" According to Lactantius (c. 49), an attempt at suicide by poi
son was followed by a wretched disease, bringing to a lingering and
most painful death.

7 Bassianus, who had married Anastasia, sister of Constantine,
was incited by his brother, who was an adherent of Licinius, to
revolt against Constantine. The attempt was nipped in the bud,
and Constantine demanded from Licinius the author of the plot.
His refusal, together with the throwing down of the statues of Con
stantine, was the direct occasion of the war (Anon. Wales. p. 473).
Compare Eusebius, I'. C. 1. 50-51, and Socr. 1. 3, where Licinius is
charged with repeated treachery, perjury, and hypocrisy.
Zosimus,
on the other hand (2.18), distinctly says that Licinius was not to
blame, but that Constantine, with characteristic faithlessness to their
agreement, tried to alienate some of Licinius' provinces.

took Illyrium to his other possessions."
After this battle and the re-division there was a truce
between the emperors for some years, during the early part of which (in 316 or 315) the Decen

Third Five Years.

About the time of his decennial celebration," his sons Crispus and Constantine, and Licinius,
son of Licinius, were made Caesars. The peace between the emperors continued during the
whole of this period.
There was more or less fighting with the frontier tribes, Crispus, e.g.,

period he was at Milan, where the Donatist matter, which had been dragging along since 31 1,
came up for final settlement (cf. note, above). He was also at one time or another at Arles and
at Rome, but the latter and greater part of the period was spent mainly in Dacia and Pannonia
(cf. Laws, as above). The close of his fifteen years was celebrated somewhat prematurely at
Rome, in the absence of Constantine, by the oration of Nazarius (cf. Naz. Paneg.).

Fourth Fire Years.

If the third period was relatively quiet, the fourth was absolutely stirring. There had undoubt

in this period there was a most important campaign against the Sarmatians, in which they were
defeated and their king taken prisoner."
In honor of this victory coins were struck (Eckhel,

Nine years of peace proved the utmost limit of mutual patience, and Constantine and Licinius
came to words, and from words to blows.
For a long time Constantine had been vexed at the

melted down (Anon. Contin. Dio. Cass., in Müller, Fragm. Hiss. Gr. 4 [1868] 199).
Altogether
they soon came to blows. The steps were short, sharp, decisive.
Constantine defeated Licinius
by land (July 3, 323), and through Crispus, by sea (Soz. I. 7 ; Anon. Vales. p. 474-5; Zos.
After the defeat at Adrianople, Licinius retreated to Byzantium (Zos. 2. 23-5; Vict.

as Helenopolis (Hieron. An. 2343; Chron. Pasch. p. 283 (?); Socr. H. E. I. 18; Soz. 2. 2;

magnificent Constantinople,' which was dedicated in 330 (Idatius; Chron. Pasch. p. 285 ;

It was probably during this period, too, that the work
of improvement in Jerusalem was undertaken, and Helena made her famous visit thither (Euseb.

the soundation of this "New Rome," and that it was begun soon
after his visit there. He first began to build his capital near the site

Last Years.

Later in this year, Constantine is known to have been at Jerusalem, where he dedicated a
church ( V. C. 4. 4o ; Chron. Pasch., but wrong year).
It was also the year of the Synods of
Tyre (Athanas. c. Ar. I. p. 788; W. C. 4.41 ; Theod. 1. 28). The same year, or early in the
following one, Eusebius pronounced his tricennial oration (see Special Prolegomena).
In 337
the Great Emperor died at Ancyrona, near Nicomedia, just as he was preparing for an expedition
against the Persians, and was buried in the Church of the Apostles, at Constantinople (cf. notes

Inherited Characteristics.

The fact of the inheritance of character, virtues or vices as the case may be, curiously recog
nized in various nations and ancient philosophies (cf. Ribot. Heredity, N.Y. 1875, p. 375-6),
and even in the ten commandments, has received the clearer exposition of modern science.

and philanthropist (cf. Sinclair, in Smith & W. I. 661-2).
Constantine is said to have in
herited his father's strength, courage, personal appearance (Eumen. Paneg. c. 4), piety (Pseud.-
Leo, p. 83; cf. Const. and Euseb. in V. C. 2. 49), and general virtues. The slur of Zosimus
on the character of Constantine's mother seems to have been quite gratuitous.

Physical Characteristics.

A graphic picture of his personal appearance is drawn by Cedrenus (p. 472-3).

"Constan
tinus Magnus was of medium height, broad-shouldered, thick-necked, whence his epithet Bull
necked.
His complexion was ruddy, his hair neither thick nor crisp curling, his beard scanty
and not growing in many places, his nose slightly hooked, and his eyes like the eyes of a lion.
He was joyous of heart and most cheery of countenance."" Many points in this description are
confirmed by others, some apparently contradicted. Taken in detail, his Height was probably
above medium.
Over against this statement of Cedrenus (p. 472) that he was of middle height
is that of the earlier Malalas (13. 1), who, while confirming the ruddiness of complexion, charac
terizes him as tall, and the explicit testimony of Eusebius, that among those with Diocletian
"there was no one comparable with him for height" (V. C. I. 19), and likewise among those
present at Nicaea (V. C. 3. Io).
But a "thick-necked " form hardly belongs to the strictly "tall"
man, and a thick neck and broad shoulders would hardly belong to a form of "distinguished
comeliness," if it were short (Lact. c. 18).
It may be supposed therefore that he can be described
Moreover, there would naturally have been more mention of height by
as above medium height.
Lactantius and Panegyrists if it had been very extraordinary.
In respect of Countenance he was
undoubtedly handsome. The "majestic beauty of his face" mentioned by Theophanes (p. 29 ;
cf. V. C. I. 19 ; 3. Io) is confirmed by suggestions in the Panegyrists (e.g. Eumen. c. 17 ; Naz.

c. 24), and all general testimony, and not belied by the coins.
"reddish" in the expression of Cedrenus (p. 272), "fiery" in that of Malalas (13. 1).
His
Afair, rather thin and straight, scanty Beard, and "slightly hooked " Aose are shown also by the
coins, where the nose varies from a pronounced Roman or ungraceful eagle's beak to a very pro
portionate, slightly aquiline member. His Eyes were lion-like (Cedren.), piercingly bright (Paneg.
His Expression was bright and joyous (Cedren.), characterized by
313, c. 19 ; also Eumen.).
"noble gravity mingled with hilarity" (Naz. Paneg. c. 24), by "serenity" and "cheerfulness" (cf.
Euseb. V. C. 3. 11).

In brief, he seems to have been a type of the sanguine temperament.

Added to his beauty of face was an unquestioned beauty of form.

His distinguished comeli
ness of Figure (Lact. c. 18) is a favorite theme with his enthusiastic friend Eusebius, who says,
"No one was comparable with him for grace and beauty of person" (cf. Eumen. c. 17 ; P. C. I.

1. Cf. Vict. Epit. p. 51, where "bull-necked" is rendered as seem to make it refer to energy and obstinate force of character,

19 ; 3. Io), and that his figure was "manly and vigorous " (1. 20). The broad Shoulders and
thick Meck prepare one for the testimony to his great bodily Strength. The feats of personal
valor in combat with the Sarmatian champions and the wild beasts (cf. above), his personal
energy in battle (e.g. before Verona; cf. above), much special testimony (e.g. Eumen. Paneg. c. 4)
and all the general testimony, show that the superlative language of Eusebius is well grounded,
and interpreted with conservative imagination is to be taken as fact.
According to him, "he so
far surpassed his compeers in personal strength as to be a terror to them" (V. C. I. 19), and in
respect of Vigor of body was such that at the Council of Nicaea his very bearing showed that he
surpassed all present in "invincible strength and vigor"; while at the age of sixty or upwards, "he
still possessed a sound and vigorous body, free from all blemish and of more than youthful
vivacity; a noble mien and strength equal to any exertion, so that he was able to join in martial
exercises, to ride, endure the fatigues of travel, engage in battle," &c. (Vict. 4. 53).
In Bearing
he was "manly " (V. C. 1. 20), self-possessed, calm ( V. C. 3. 11), dignified ("noble gravity,"
Naz. c. 24; cf. Eumen. &c.), with "majestic dignity of mien" ( V. C. 3. Io) and serenity (V. C.
In Manners he was "suave" (ćrtetxss) (P. C. 3. Io) and "affable to all " (V. C. 3.
3. Io).
This singular affability was such, according to Lactantius (c. 18), as to endear him greatly
13).
Over against this, however, must be set the statement of Victor, Epit. that he

But this seems founded

on a false exegesis (cf. above) and withal there is no absolute contradiction.
Moreover, all his
intercourse with bishops, deputies, soldiers, citizens, barbarians, seems to have generally made a
favorable impression, and such success without assability of manner would have been marvelous.
In Dress his taste, late in life at least, became somewhat gorgeous.
If he were reigning to-day,
the comic papers would undoubtedly represent him, like some other good and great men, with
exaggerated red neckties and figured waistcoats. He "always wore a diadem," according to
Victor, Epit. (p. 51), and according to many (Malal. 13. 7-8; Cedren. ; Pseudo-Leo, &c.)
"none of the emperors before him "wore the diadem at all.
Eusebius' description of his appear
ance at the Council of Nicaea would do credit to a Washington reporter on wedding-toilets; he
was "clothed in raiment which glittered, as it were, with rays of light, reflecting the glowing
radiance of a purple robe, and adorned with the brilliant splendor of gold and precious stones"
( V. C. 3. 1 o').

§ 4. Mem/a/ Characteristics.

In respect of Education, it

According to his biographer-friend, Constantine was even more conspicuous for the excellence
of his psychical qualities than his physical (P. C. I. 19). Among these qualities are natural intelli
gence (P. C. I. 19), sound judgment (V. C. I. 19), well-disciplined power of thought (Theoph.
p. 29), and peculiarly, as might be expected from his eye and general energy, penetration
is said on the one hand that he "reaped the
(Theoph. p. 29).
advantages of a liberal education " (J. C. I. 19), and particularly that he was thoroughly
trained in the art of reasoning (P. C.); but according to Anonymous Vales. (p. 471), and also
Cedrenus (p. 473), his literary education was scanty.
If there was early lack, he made up
for it afterwards with characteristic energy, for he attained very considerable erudition (of a

liberal studies.
According to Lydus he was skilled both in the science of letters and the science
of arms; for "if he had not excelled in both sciences, he would not have been made emperor of
the Romans'' (Lydus, de Magist. 3. 33), - a somewhat subjective ground.
Such was his devo
tion to study that, according to Eusebius (V. C. 4. 29), "he sometimes passed sleepless nights
in furnishing his mind with divine knowledge."
The measure of his thoroughness may be
gathered from the fact that his knowledge of Greek even, does not seem to have been very
extensive-"with which he was not altogether unacquainted " (P. C. 3. 13).
His learning, as
shown in his orations, is the learning of a man of affairs, and has many elements of crudity and

consequent pretentiousness; but he is not worse than many authors - much better than most
royal authors.

His learning had at least the excellent quality that it was radiated with reference to expression,
as all sound learning must be.
According to Eusebius, much of his time was spent in composing
discourses, many of which he delivered in public (V. C. 4. 29), and he continued to the last to
compose discourses and to deliver frequent orations in public.

The description by Eusebius of the character of his orations (V. C. 4. 24) seems to forbid
any assumption of pure vanity as his motive.
It is the most natural thing in the world that an
emperor should make speeches, and that he should speak on scholastic or religious themes, and
with the use of classical philosophy, mythology, and literature, should be no surprise in the days
of President Harrison, Mr. Gladstone, and the Emperor William. There is no doubt he wrote
and spoke vigorously and effectively to his soldiers, and on political and judicial matters (witness
his laws), and his learned literary production is very fair amateur work, considering.
In the
Delivery of his speeches he seems to have had self-possession and modesty of manner, as e.g.
at the Council of Nicaea, where "he looked serenely around on the assembly with a cheerful
aspect, and having collected his thoughts, in a calm and gentle tone .
. proceeded to speak"
His Literary style was somewhat inflated and verbose, but for this, compare
(W. C. 3. 11).

example and continuing his work, he encouraged the schools in Gaul (cf. above).
Hosius and
Eusebius were his friends and counselors. He made Lactantius tutor to Crispus (Hieron. Chron.).
He had copies of the Scriptures made and distributed ( V. C. 3. 1).
In short, he especially
"encouraged the study of letters" (Vict. Epit. 51) in every way.

His Patronage of learning showed his interest in it.

Moral Characteristics.

(a) In relations with events, things, or /ersons.

First of all, Constantine excelled in Energy,
that fundamental of all developed character. He was pre-eminent for masculine strength of char
acter (Theoph. p. 29), a man of energy (vir ingens, Eutrop. Io. 1). This was manifested at every
turn, in his successful military activity under Diocletian, in the decisive acts at the time of leaving
him, in the prosecution of campaigns against Maximian, Maxentius, Licinius, in the wholesale
way in which he pushed internal improvements, the building of Constantinople, the multiplication
of Christian houses of worship, in his studies, in his law-making; in short, in everything he touched

effecting whatever he had settled in his mind" (Eutrop. Io. 5).
His Rapidity of action when he
rejoined his father is described by Lactantius as incredible (Lact. c. 24). He showed the same
alacrity in his quick return and surprise of Maximian, in his first entry into Italy, and in his cam

Verona, before Rome, and at Cibalis to plunge into the midst of battle, communicating his own
resistless, indomitable, alert will to do, to his soldiers.
Closely linked with these qualities was
that personal Courage and Valor, inherited from his father (Paneg. 307, c. 3), mentioned by

of all his qualities was witnessed to even by the scoffing Julian as "inexpressibly" great (Orat.
p. 13), and mentioned even in the work whose chief aim seems, almost, to detract from Constan
tine (Caes. p. 23).
United with all these characteristics of greatness was a far-reaching Ambition.
This on the one hand is represented to be an ambition for power and glory. He was "exceed
ingly ambitious of military glory" (Eutrop, Io. 7); "aspiring to the sovereignty of the whole world"
(Eutrop. Io. 5).
According to Zosimus, at the time of the appointment of Severus and Maximin,
already having his mind set on attaining royalty he was roused to a greater desire by the honor
conferred on Severus and Maximin, and this eager desire of power was already well known to many.
On the other hand, this ambition is represented to be a burning zeal for righting wrongs; his

in his legislation, and in his internal improvements.

In view of all this powerfulness of personality, it may be said of all successes of this "man
of power" (Eutrop. Io. 5) what Eutropius says of his success in war, that it was great, "but not

ever, he was far from being headstrong. On the contrary, he showed marked Prudence, resem
bling his father in this also (Paneg. 307, c. 3).
Sustaining so long the delicate position at the
court of Diocletian, all his provision for guarding the frontiers, his long-suffering in waiting to

thing in hand before meeting Licinius, his wise moderation in demand on the conquered, and the

Patience withal.
This latter virtue was peculiarly characteristic whether exercised in respect of
things or plans or people, and his great patience in listening to complaints (Naz. c. 24) is only a

unshaken" (Theoph. p. 29) Steadfastness.
So great energy united with these other qualities
barely needs testimony to suggest great Faithfulness to his tasks in hand, as in that "strict atten
tion to his military duties" which Lactantius says (c. 18) characterized him as a young man.
In
brief, his whole personality was a marked example of that balance of power and the measuring of
remote ends which is included under the word Sess-control, in the use of the philosophy of which
he, as well as his father, was a disciple.
In this exercise of his great energy towards himself he
was recognized to be remarkable.
This self-control was manifested especially in his unusual

Chastity.
The specific testimony of Eusebius to this (V. C.) would have comparatively little weight on a point
like this, and the same might be said, in a measure, of the testimony of the Panegyrists (Naz. c. 24;
307, c. 4; 313, c. 4), who mention this virtue.
But panegyrical art would forbid the laudation
of what was conspicuously lacking; rather it would not be mentioned, and the general testimony
goes to show at least a contemporary reputation for extraordinary continence, considering his
time and environment.
His relationship with Minervina hardly touches this reputation, whether
she was wife or only legitimate concubine. The accusations and innuendoes of Julian, Caesars,
have, in any fairly critical estimate, hardly more than the weight of some malignant gossip whose

have been unable to understand that purity of heart which permitted the free companionship of
women in social or religious life.
Julian's general charge of luxuriousness and sensuousness
(p. 43, 306, 25, 38, 42, &c.) must be regarded largely in the same light; for this delight in
soft garments, precious gems, games, and festivities was, if we can judge aright, in no sense
"enervating pleasure and voluptuous indulgence": for he was indefatigable in studies and works
of all sorts, although it is perhaps to be referred to the vanity and love of display of which he is
accused, and of which more later.
(b) In re/ations with people.

In general he was Amia//e, - popular with the soldiers, popular
even with his subdued enemies (Eutrop. Io. 7).
Diocletian reminded Galerius (Lact. c. 18) that
he was "amiable," and he must have been so ; for he was "loved by soldiers" (Eumen. c. 16),
and so "endeared to the troops" that in the appointment of Caesar he was "the choice of every
individual" (Lact. c. 18).
This popularity he indeed "sought by every kind of liberality and
obligingness" (Eutr. 10. 7.), but what he sought he found.

A very large element in this popularity was the universal Mi//ness, Mercifulness, and Forbear
ance which he showed.
In these is found a class of characteristics which stand alongside his
energy of character as peculiarly characteristics and great. "He whose familiar habit it was
to save men's lives" (W. C. 4. 6), as a young man promised, in the opinion of Diocletian

CONSTANTINE THE GREAT.

(Lact. c. 18), to be "milder and more merciful than his father." Even in the opinion of Julian he
was "far more humane (Tpadrepov), and in very many other respects superior to others, as I would
demonstrate if there were opportunity" (Julian, Orat. p. 15); and he again (p. 96) speaks of him
in laudatory terms as contrasted with the other emperors.
Eusebius, as might be expected, is
still stronger in expression, and sets Constantine "in contrast with tyrants who were stained with
blood of countless numbers," saying that in Constantine's reign "the sword of justice lay idle,"
and men were "rather constrained by a paternal authority than governed by the stringent power
of the laws" (V. C. 3. 1).
This mercifulness he manifested on every occasion. "When Sigu
sium was on fire," he directed greater effort towards saving it than he had to capturing it (Naz.
Paneg. c. 21). At the taking of Rome he punished a certain few only of those most intimate with
Maxentius (Zos.), and even Zosimus notes the great joy and relief of people at the exchange of

most rare of other emperors, is found a considerable number of times of him.
So great was this
mildness of conduct that he was "generally blamed for his clemency" (V. C. 4. 31), on the
ground that crimes were not visited with their proper penalties. The testimony to this humane
ness of character is almost unlimited and conclusive, but there is more or less evidence which is
urged in qualification or contradiction.
It is rather a common thing to say that he was at first
mild, but later pride of prosperity caused him greatly to depart from this former agreeable mild
ness of temper (Eutrop.). Then the execution of the various members of his own family (cf. discus
sion below), the exposure of prisoners to the wild beasts (Eumen. Paneg. c. 12), his severe decree
against those who should conceal copies of the works of Arius (Socr. I. 9), his treatment of the
Jews (Greg. Niceph., or at least his laws), and the severe penalties of some of his laws are among
the points brought against him.
But the remark of Eutropius is to be interpreted by the "former
agreeable mildness of temper," to which he himself witnesses, and the fact that this latter period
was that where the points of view of the two men had widely diverged. The exposure of
prisoners to wild beasts was no evidence of cruelty in itself; for under the customs then prevailing
it might have been cruelty to his subjects not to have done this, and his treatment of the bar
barian enemies is rather to be interpreted in the light of the testimony of Eutropius that he
"left on the minds of the barbarians [Goths] a strong remembrance of his kindness" (Io. 7).
His treatment of his family is discussed elsewhere, but whatever its bearings may be, there is no
just historico-psychological ground whatever for the use of the word which is so freely bandied, -
cruelty.
Even the extreme of the Panegyrist who says to him,
"you are such by inheritance and destiny that you cannot be cruel" (Eumen. Paneg. c. 14), is
nearer the truth. The penalties of his laws lay him open in a degree to a charge of growing severity;
but it was great, if sometimes mistaken and overzealous, regard for what he deemed the public
welfare, and on quite a different plane from anything which we express as cruelty. Though with
the growing conservatism of a man who finds his purposes of mercy continually perverted and his
indulgences abused, he yet remained to the end of his life most merciful and mild compared with
those who went before and who followed.

Cruel he was not in any sense.

This fact becomes more clear in seeing how he excelled in kindred virtues. The Patience
already mentioned, distinguished forbearance, and undoubted benevolence, or at least generosity,
are traits which group with mercy and have no fellowship with cruelty. And these he had. He
showed distinguished Forbearance, and that oftentimes, as in a disturbance at Antioch, where he
"applied with much forbearance the remedy of persuasion " (V. C. 3. 59). The outrageous
conduct of those who, in the Arian disturbances, dared "even to insult the statues of the emperor
. had little power to excite his anger, but rather caused in him sorrow of spirit" (P. C.
.
3. 4), "and he endured with patience men who were exasperated against himself."
These words
are by Eusebius, to be sure; but his conduct with Donatists, Arians, Maximinianus, and Licinius,
in individual and on the whole, show that in fact he did habitually exercise great forbearance.
To this was added much activity of positive Kindness. On first accession he "visited with much

.

PROLEGOMENA.

.

considerate kindness all those provinces" (V. C. p. 23).
This kindness was shown throughout
his reign, and brightly illustrated in his treatment of the persecuted Christians from the begin
ning, - in his acts in Gaul, in his famous toleration edict, in his letter to Maximin, and in his

of their estates should be permitted to enjoy them again, .
. unjustly exiled were recalled and
freed from imprisonment (Euseb. V. C. 1. 41).
After the victory over Licinius he recalled Chris
tian exiles, ordered restitution of property, released from labor in mines, from the solitude of
islands, from toil in public works, &c., those who had been oppressed in these ways (V. C.
p. 70-71). There is strong concensus of testimony to a very lovable habitual exercise of this trait
in his "readiness to grant hearing," "patience in listening," and "kindness of response" to those
whose complaints he had patiently listened to (Naz. 24). He was most excellent (commodis
simus) to hear embassies and complaints of provinces (Vict. Epit. p. 51), - a testimony which
His magnificent gifts and
is borne out by the facts.
His Generosity is equally undoubted.
largesses to the army were still remembered in the time of Julian (Orat. p. 13).
His constant
and lavish giving to the Christians is Eusebius' unending theme: but it was not to the churches
alone; for we read of his munificence to heathen tribes (V. C. 2. 22), his liberality to the poor
(W. C. 1. 43) in giving money for clothing, provision for orphans and widows, marriage portions
for virgins, compensation to losers in law suits (V. C. 4. 4).
It was "scarcely possible to be
near him without benefit" (V. C. 1. 43 ; cf. V. C. 3. 16; 3. 22 ; 4. 44).

.

.

Though slow to serve some friends through suspicion (i.e. dubius thus explained), he was "ex
ceedingly generous towards others, neglecting no opportunity to add to their riches and honors"
(Eutrop. Io. 7).
"With royal magnificence he unlocked all his treasures and distributed
his gifts with rich and high-souled liberality" (V. C. 3. 1). He seems to have carried it rather
to excess, even on the showing of Eusebius. "No one could request a favor of the emperor,
. He devised new dignities, that he might invest a
and fail of obtaining what he sought. .
larger number with the tokens of his favor" (V. C. 4. 2).
It is worth giving the account by
Eusebius of this conduct in full here. He says (V. C. 4. 54) that this "was a virtue, however,
which subjected him to censure from many, in consequence of the baseness of wicked men, who
ascribed their own crimes to the emperor's forbearance.
In truth, I can myself bear testimony
to the grievous evils which prevailed during those times: I mean the violence of rapacious and
unprincipled men, who preyed on all classes of society alike, and the scandalous hypocrisy of
those who crept into the church. .
. His own benevolence and goodness of heart, the genuine
ness of his own faith, and his truthfulness of character induced the emperor to credit the profes
sions of those reputed Christians who craftily preserved the semblance of sincere affection for his
person. The confidence he reposed in such men sometimes forced him into conduct unworthy
of himse//, of which envy took advantage to cloud in this respect the luster of his character."
There seems, therefore, some ground for the charge of Prodigality, that he "wasted public money
in many useless buildings, some of which he shortly after destroyed because they were not built
to stand" (Zos.), and (Zos. p. 104) "gave great largesses to ill-deserving persons, mistaking
profusion for munificence " (Tijv yöp doorsaw hystro buxorutav).
Zosimus adds that to do this,
he "imposed severe taxes on all, so severe that fathers were obliged to prostitute their daughters
to raise the money, that tortures were employed, and in consequence whole villages depopulated."
This testimony is, however, by one bitterly prejudiced, who regarded money spent on Christian
houses of worship as worse than wasted, and indicates only what appears from Eusebius as well,
that expenditures for cities, schools, and churches built, and for other matters, must have been
But so, too, they were enormous under other emperors, and Constantine, at least,
enormous.
instead of spending on debauchery, seems to have had something to show for it.
As to taxes,
Zosimus would undoubtedly sympathize with the Kentucky moonshiners in their "oppression "
by revenue officers, if he were here now and Constantine were President, and would fulminate
in the daily papers against the wicked party which by its wicked tariff compels men to marry

their daughters to rich husbands in order to get their taxes paid, - and incidental luxuries
supplied.
But that does not say that an exorbitant tariff, to supply "jobs" which shall furnish
rich "spoils" for those who have "pulls" out of the pockets of the many, is good ; yet this,
in modern phrase, is about what Constantine did.
Constantine's trust in his friends and gener
osity to the unworthy, with its consequences on the tax-payers, reminds strikingly of some of our
own soldier-presidents, whom we love and admire without approving all their acts. And yet, on
the other hand, much of the expenditure was for solid improvement, and could only be criticised
by those who now oppose expenditures for navy, for improved postal service, public buildings,
subsidies, &c.; though yet, again, his wholesale way of doing things also reminds one of the large
generosity of some modern politicians in their race for popularity, with their Pension, Education,

as shown by his entertainings at the Council of Nicaea (V. C. 4.49).
With all these qualities of
amiable popularity there seems to have been joined a yet more fundamental element, of perma
nent influence among men, in a spirit of Justice so marked that the claim of the Panegyrist is
hardly too sweeping when he says that "all who took refuge with him for whatever cause he
treated justly and liberally " (Paneg. 307. 5) - if there is added "up to his light and ability."
Closely linked with this again is that " Unbending righteousness" of which Theophanes (p. 29)
speaks. And to all these qualities was added that synthesis of qualities, - a remarkable 7 act in
his intercourse with men, a trait typically exemplified in his conduct at the Council of Nicaea,
where "the emperor gave patient audience to all alike, and reviewed every proposition with
steadfast attention, and by occasionally assisting the arguments of each party in turn, he grad

ually disposed even the most vehement disputants to a reconciliation, .

.

-

But success with men and popularity seem to have opened that pitfall of success, - Vanity, -
and it is charged that he fell thereinto, although there is testimony to the exact contrary.
According to Victor (Epit. p. 51) he was "immeasurably greedy of praise."
This agrees with, and
is at the same time modified by Eutropius' testimony to his ambition for glory and for honorable
popularity (10. 7), and his apparently complacent reception of the outrageous flattery of Optatian
(cf. his letter), seems at least to show some weakness in this direction. So again his tendency
toward Magnificence, as shown in his assuming the diadem and his dress in general (cf. above),
in the splendor of banquets as witnessed by his approving friend (P. C. 3. 15), his desire to do
on a large scale whatever he did, whether in the building of cities or splendid houses of worship,
or in book-binding ornamentations of pearls and gems. And yet again it is shown in what seems
at this distance his Conceit, sublime in its unconsciousness in reckoning himself a sort of thirteenth,
but, it would seem, a facile princeps apostle, in the disposition for his burial, "anticipating with
extraordinary fervor of faith that his body would share their title with the apostles themselves.
He accordingly caused twelve coffins to be set up in this church, like sacred pillars, in
honor and memory of the apostolic number, in the centre of which his own was placed, having
six of theirs on either side of it" (V. C. 4. 60). One can seem to read in this a whole history
of unblushing flattery, and it reminds that Eunapius (Vic, aedes. p. 41) has spoken of his pleasure

arrogant by these plaudits nor uplifted by the praises" (Euseb. V. C. I. 39), and of the Chronicon
Paschale (p. 521) that "he was not at all puffed up by the acclamations," evidently represent a

power, recognizing its own success, glad of the recognition of others, not at bottom because of
cold vanity, but from warm appreciation of human friendliness, became through success in carry
ing out what seemed to him, and were, divine plans, fired with the thought that he was the
especial and necessary minister of God, that his thoughts and will were directly touched by the
Divine Will and thus that whatever he thought or willed was infallible. He is not unlike some
modern rulers. The spirit, though one of real vanity, or egotism at least, has an element of
nobleness in it, and in most of its manifestations commands respect along with the smile. The
accusation of Zosimus of Arrogance "when he had attained to the sole authority," and that he
"gave himself up to the unrestrained exercise of his power," must be interpreted like those of other
un-Christian witnesses, in the light of the fact that his actions worked relative hardships to the
non-Christians, and that very justice to the Christians would seem injustice to them, and if Con
stantine was more than just, his generosity was at some one's expense.
His energy of execution
and constant success, with his dominating idea of a Divine mission, would naturally engender this
faith in his own infallibility; for what is arrogance but this vanity joined with power?
His action
toward schismatics - Donatists, Arians, or orthodox troublers of his peace-was such as to suggest
some degree of this vice.
Yet his success in keeping the followers of the old religion fairly molli
fied, and his generally successful tact, showed that this was in no sense a dominating and unrelieved
characteristic. Two other weaknesses closely allied with these are also imputed to Constantine:
Jealousy, as illustrated by the statement that "wishing to minimize the deeds of his predecessors,
he took pains to tarnish their virtues by giving them jocose epithets" (Dion. Cont. 2 [Müller,
p. 199]; cf. Vict. Epit. p. 51), and Suspiciousness (Eutrop. Io. 7); for which latter, a man who
had survived as many plots as he had, might well be excused.

So long as sentimentalists continue to send bouquets to
murderers and erect monuments to anarchists, they will regard execution, even legal execution,
as prima facie evidence of cruelty, and the killing of a murderer in self-defense, or the hanging
of a traitor, as crime.
Constantine's whole character ensures that if he thought he could have
spared them, or any one, with safety, he would have done so."

In general he was a faithful husband as respects marital virtue, and a good father. He took
care that his children should be well educated.
Crispus was under Lactantius (Hieron.), and
the others perhaps under Arborius ("Auson. de Prof. Burdig. 16"); at all events, he had the most
accomplished teachers of secular learning to instruct in the art of war, and in political and legal
science (V. C. 4. 51), and both by his own instruction and that of men of approved piety, took
special pains with their religious training. He early appointed them to offices of authority, and
distributed the empire among them.

morse of Constantine for the death of Crispus are mythical. The

tale of Sopater has been mentioned.
Co. p. 62-63), also that, "in regret for death of Crispus, he erected
a statue of pure silver with the inscription, "My unjustly treated
son,' and did penance besides," falls into the same category.

* Seeck (Zosch r.s. wiss. Theol. 1890, p. 73) maintains that it is
established ("urkundlich fest") that Licinius was still living in 336,
in which case he would have been more than twenty years old. He

maintains also that he was not the son of Constantine, but the ille

In general, the remark of Luder
mann (Lipsius, Theol. Wah rà. 1886, p. 108) is valid, "The argu
ments against Constantine's Christianity, which are drawn from his
moral character, have ever been the weakest."

PROLEGOMENA.

(d) In relations with friends.

His general conduct toward his friends was marked by very
great liberality (cf. above).
Eutropius speaks emphatically of this even while he uses the expres
sion which has been such a puzzle to all, that "toward some of his friends he was double" (or
dangerous), a phrase which is interpreted by Johannes Ant. as meaning "to some of friends false
(unsound, iročAws) and unsafe (unwholesome, oix yūs)" (ed. Müller 4. p. 602-3).
His uni
form effort to please his friends has been discussed above.

(e) In relations with society.

1. As General he seems to have been popular with his own
soldiers (cf. above), inspiring them with enthusiasm and energy.
Toward hostile soldiers he was
merciful (cf. above), not following up an advantage further than was necessary, and toward con
quered enemies unusually forbearing; e.g. at Sigusium, at Rome, with Maximian, with Licinius, and

of his rear, and by rapidity of movement and dash in actual conflict.
2. As Legislator he
"enacted many laws, some good, but most of them superfluous, and some severe" (Eutrop. Io. 8).
He seems to have had a weakness for law-making which, at all events, shows a characteristic
respect for law little shared by his early contemporaries. Of course Eutropius would consider all
laws in favor of Christians superfluous.
Laws for the abolition of idolatrous practices, for the
erection of Christian houses of worship, observance of the Lord's Day (P. C. 4. 23), permitting
cases to be tried before bishops (Soz. I. 9 ; Euseb. H. E. Io. 7; Cod. Theod. Tit. de episc. 2),
&c., would surely seem so.
But even in other laws Constantine seems to have had at times an
abnormal zeal for law-making, when his energies were not occupied in war or church-building.
The laws were generally wise and, at the least, benevolently or righteously meant.
Such were the
abolition of crucifixion (Vict. Caes.) and of gladiatorial shows (V. C. 4. 25; Socr. 1.8; C. Theod.
15. 12. 1), the law that the families of slaves were not to be separated (C. Theod. 2. 25), that
forbidding the scourging of debtors (C. Theod. 7. 3), and that repressing calumny (Vict. Epit. 51).
Among the "severe" laws were such as punished certain forms of illicit intercourse with death.
3. As Statesman his policy was broad and far-reaching.
He fully organized and carefully
established one section of his territory before he enlarged. He changed the whole constitution
of the empire, both civil and military (cf. Wordsworth, in Smith & W.). He inaugurated reforms
in finance, and especially was most assiduous in the matter of internal improvements, restoring
and building from one end of the empire to the other. The great characteristic consummation
of his reign was the union of Church and State, over which men are still divided as to whether it
was a tremendous blessing or a tremendous curse. Tremendous it surely was in its shaping power
on world history.
The general statement of
Eutropius that "in the beginning of his reign he might have been compared to the best princes,
in the latter part only to those of a middling character," must be interpreted by the fact that
during the latter part of his reign he was so associated with Christianity, in itself a falling away in

an order out of chaos, a reign in which it could be peculiarly said that "chastity was safe and
marriage protected " (Naz. c. 38), where a man's life and property were secure as under few of
the Roman emperors.
It is idle to refuse the title of Great to a man who, from the beginning,
followed a consistent, though developing policy, organized the interior, and securely guarded the
frontier of his empire at each enlargement, and finally unified the whole on such a basis as to
secure large internal prosperity and development.

Religious Characteristics.

Was Constantine a Christian?

This vain question has to be considered, hardly discussed.
The interminable opinions, one way or the other, are for the most part wise-seeming, meaningless
generalizations.
Like any generalized statement, it is conditioned by the point of view of the
author. When ten men answered the question "What is a Christian?" in ten different ways, who

is not a Christian himself, and so on. A good Biblical, Protestant starting-point is to say he was

action.

inherited his father's piety (Paneg. 307, c. 5), and was inclined to monotheism. The words of
advisers must have made him think at least, and he seems to have made a sort of test of believing
at the time of the famous "vision of the cross," whatever that may have been.
Judging from
the way men think and feel their way to faith, it seems psychologically probable that, feeling his
way along to that point, he tried faith and, having success, he substantially believed from that time
on.
Certainly from a very early period after this, the evidences begin to be clear and increasingly
so as presumably his faith itself became more clear and fixed. The account in Eusebius of the
process of thought by which he inclined toward Christianity has the greatest plausibility. He
says that "considering the matter of Divine assistance, it occurred to him that those who had
relied on idols had been deceived and destroyed, while his father .
. had honored the one
.
Supreme God, had found him Saviour, &c. .
. he judged it folly to join in the idle worship of
those who were no gods .
. and felt it incumbent on him to honor no other than the God of
his father." The nature of the vision of the cross, whether a miracle, a natural phenomenon, or
only a dream, does not affect the probability of the account by Eusebius of what followed it
(W. C. I. 32). "At the time above specified, being struck with amazement at the extraordinary
vision, and resolving to worship no other God save him who had appeared to him, he sent for
those who were acquainted with the mysteries of his doctrines, and inquired also what God was.
.
. They affirmed that he was God, the only begotten Son of the one and only God," and
he thereupon "made the priests of God his counsellors and deemed it incumbent on him to
honor the God who had appeared to him, with all devotion."
According to Sozomen, "it is uni
versally admitted Constantine embraced the religion of the Christians previous to his war with
Maxentius and prior to his return to Rome and Italy; and this is evidenced by the dates of the

This
is confirmed, too, by the remark of the Panegyrist (313, c. 4; cf. c. 2 and c. 11), that he con
ducted the war by Divine instruction, and the famous inscription on the triumphal arch, "instinctu
Divinitatis." According to Augustine he was at the time of the petition of the Donatists, "mind
ful of the hope which he maintained in Christ" (August. contra sits. Petil. Bk. II. c. 92, p. 205).
The tales of his baptism at this time, or by Sylvester at all, are pure fables (cf. under The Myshi
cal Constantine), but it appears from antecedent probability, from testimony, and from his early
subsequent identification with the Christians that he became fairly convinced at this time.
His

the fact of his Christian advisers, of his laws in behalf of Christians, and various substantial favors
to them, his recognition of their God as his one God, makes it almost idle to discuss the question.
Was Constantine a Christian in 314 P What is a Christian? He seems to have been. The type

His position was not yet secure. He had to use his utmost tact to keep all elements in hand.
He was conditioned just as a modern Christian emperor or president, a majority of whose political
advisers and subjects or electors are non-religious. He had great problems of political organiza
tion to effect, and was immersed in these. The only matter of surprise is that he grew so rapidly.
There is no ground whatever for supposing that he dissembled to the end, or even at all. To say
that his retaining the title of pontifex maximus, or making concessions respecting the old worship,
or allowing soothsayers to be consulted, or even the postponement of his baptism, indicate this,

shrinking from an open profession of the Christian name, that he rather desired to make it mani

Really the question whether
he considered himself, or was considered, a Christian at and after the time of the Council of
Nicaea is too idle even to mention, if it had not been gravely discussed.
In the opinion of the
bishops there he was "most pious " and "dear to God" (Ep. synod. in Socr. I. 9 ; Theodoret,
I. 8). On his part, letters are full of pious expression and usually begin or end or both with
"beloved brethren." To the council itself he describes himself as "fellow-servant" of " Him
who is our common Lord and Saviour."
Another more considerable position is that all that

testimony of Eusebius and other writers, explicit as it
is, may be quite disregarded, even the
testimony to facts, such as his practice of giving thanks (J. C. I. 39), of invoking Divine aid
(Euseb. V. C. 2, 4, 6, 13; Soz. 2. 34), of his erecting a place of prayer in his palace (Soz. I. 8),
of his fasting (P. C. 2.41), of his having a stated hour of prayer (P. C. 4. 22), although all these
are interesting. The documents, however, unless by supremely uncritical rejection, can be regarded
as fundamental sources. A brief analysis of these, even though imperfect, will furnish grounds
on the basis of which those who apply various tests may apply them.
Starting from his faith in
Christ, surely the center of Christianity, he believed Christ to be Son of God, "God and the Son

dicted also by the prophets. He believed this Son of God to be his Saviour (Ad Zyr., Ad Anz,
Ad Euseb., &c.) "our common Lord and Saviour" (Ad Euse/.), "our Saviour, our hope,
and our life" (Ad ecc/.4/.).
He believed in his miraculous birth (S. C.) and in his death
for our deliverance (Ad Aic.; cf. Ad Mac. &c.), "the path which leads to everlasting life."
(S. C. 1), "a precious and toilsome " work (Ad Euseb.), and in his ascension into heaven
(S. C. 1). He believed in "God the Father" (Ad Euseb. 2), "Almighty" (Ad Euseb.), Lord
of all (Ad Euseb. 2), and the Holy Ghost (Ad eccl. Al... cf. S. C.). He believed in "Divine
Providence" (Ad Eccl. A/., Ad Alex. et Ar., Ad. Euseb. 1), God the preserver of all men
(Ad'Alex. et Ar.), who sees all things (Ad Syn. Aïc.), who is near us and the observer of all our
actions (S. C.), and "under the guidance of whose Almighty hand" he is (Ad Prov. Paz), that
all things are regulated by the determination of his will (Ad Fuse/.). He believed in the exis

only true life" (S. C. 12), the "strife for immortality" (Ad Euse/.), to which those may aspire
who know Him (S. C. 12). He believed in future rewards and punishments (Ad Prov. Pal., S.
C. 23). He believed in the inspiration of the Scriptures (Ad Eccl. A/). He loved God (Ad Euseb.
2 ; P. C. 2.55), and considered it his chief work in life to glorify Christ (S. C.). He loved his
fellow-men, being disposed "to love you with an enduring affection" (Ad Ant., W. C. 3. 60,
&c.), and recognized it as virtue in others (8, c. 11). To him, God, in general, is the source of
all blessings (Ad Proz. Pil., S. C., &c.). "I am most certainly persuaded," he says, "that I
myself owe my life, my every breath, in short, my very inmost and secret thoughts to the favor of
the Supreme God" (Ad Prov. Pal.). He recognizes contrition as a requisite for pardon (Ad.
Prov. Pal), and that it is the power of God which removes guilt (Ad' Euseb.). In the conduct
of life. "Our Saviour's words and precepts are a model, as it were, of what our life should be "
(Ad. Ant., W. C. 3. 60).

Expositions of his doctrinal and ethical positions might be multiplied almost without end from
the many and fruitful sources, but a few specimens in his own expression will best show the
spirit of his religious life. A most suggestive and beautiful sketch of Christ's ministry on earth
too long to quote here may be found in his Oration (ch. 15), but the following selections will give
the idea :

Genera/ Characterizations.

Before trying to gather into continuous statement the traits of character which have been
examined, a few general characterizations must be mentioned at least.
Beginning at the bottom,
the unfriendly, or hostile, or at the least unsympathetic, heathen testimonies generalize him as at
least relatively and on the whole both great and good. The general tendency of heathen testi
mony is to represent him as admirable in the early part of his reign, but execrable, or less admir
able, in the latter part; that of Christian writers is to represent a growth of excellence, which
raises him to saintship at the end.
Favoring Christianity was itself a

Grant. The point of view is different.
Honest and true men in the South thought Lincoln a
curse, and often in popular verdict his character was "black." The popular proverb quoted by
Victor (Epit. p. 51), "Bull-necked for ten years, for twelve a freebooter, and for ten a spend
thrift (immature child)," has just the value of a Southern popular opinion of Lincoln, or a rural
Northerner's of "Jeff Davis."
Indeed, the first might summarize at times the Southern popular
verdict of Grant; the second, a frequently expressed estimate of Lincoln's conduct in the emanci
pation of slaves; and the third, their view of the enormous expenditure for pensions of Union
soldiers, even as it was fifteen years ago.
But even the rather severe Victor, who reports this
proverb, finds Constantine "most excellent (commodissimus) in many respects," - in respect of
certain laws, in his patronage of the arts, especially that of letters, as scholar, as author, in the

in all sorts of virtue and personal excellence and good fortune, Constantine outshone all the
emperors who preceded him " (Photius, Cod. 62, ed. Müller, p. 1). And finally, the heathen
Eutropius, who characterizes from his standpoint so admirably,' though he naturally finds that
"in the beginning of his reign he might have been compared to the best princes; in the latter
part, only to those of middling character," nevertheless records "that innumerable good qualities of
mind and body were present in him," and that he was "deservedly enrolled among the gods,"-
using the meruit which he uses also of Aurelian, but not generally, and not even of Constantius.
On purely heathen testimony, therefore, Constantine, taken by and large, was comparatively
remarkable and admirable. A moderate Christian characterization is that of Theophanes (p. 29):
"Pre-eminent for masculine strength of character, penetration of mind, well-disciplined power of
thought; for unbending righteousness, ready benevolence, thorough majestic beauty of countenance,
mighty and successful in war, great in wars with the barbarians, invincible in domestic wars, and
so firm and unshaken in faith that through prayer he obtained the victory in all his battles."

whatever he had settled in his mind. .
But the pride of pros
perity caused Constantine greatly to depart from his former agree
able mildness of temper.
Falling first upon his own relatives, he
put to death his son, an excellent man; his sister's son, a youth of
amiable disposition; soon afterwards his wife; and subsequently
many of his friends.

.

.

"He was a man who, in the beginning of his reign, might have
been compared to the best princes; in the latter part of it, only
to those of middling character.
Innumerable good qualities of
mind and body were apparent in him; he was exceedingly ambitious
of military glory, and had great success in his wars; a success,

however, not more than proportioned to his exertions.

had terminated the Civil War, he also overthrew the Goths on
various occasions, granting them at last peace, and leaving on the
minds of the barbarians a strong remembrance of his kindness. He

was attached to the arts of peace and to liberal
ambitious of honorable popularity, which he, indeed, sought by
every kind of liberality and obligingness. Though he was slow,
from suspicion, to serve some of his friends, yet he was exceedingly
generous towards others, neglecting no opportunity to add to their
riches and honors. He enacted many laws, some good and equita
ble, but most of them superfluous, and some severe."

CONSTANTINE THE GREAT.

Remembering, therefore, that in order to understand a character in past centuries one must
project himself into his time; remembering again the circumstances of his time and its practice,
we shall, without forgetting any of the acts on which he has been judged, find him on indisputable
testimony Superior to most of the other emperors in character, and as much above the circumstances
of his times as would characterize a man of to-day as of peculiarly high moral character.
In view
of this, it is uncritical, and a violence to historical evidence, to approach one whom, at death, the
heathen thought worthy to be enrolled among the gods, and the Christians canonized as saint (in
the Greek calendar), as other than one who, taken all in all, was of unusual excellence of char
acter.
As in any synthesis, any organization, subordinate facts must be viewed in their relation
to their center and whole, as by any law of criminal procedure acts must be judged in the light
of general character, so any rational, legal, scientific, historical estimate of Constantine must
be in view of this fact.

$ 8. Summary.
With this as center of perspective, we have a picture of Constantine with light, and shadows,
to be sure, but in the main true in its drawing and coloring. He was a man of rather more than
medium height, strongly built, with broad shoulders, thick neck, and generally athletic and well
formed figure.
His piercing eye, slightly aquiline nose, scanty reddish beard, and florid com
plexion, together with his bright expression, made a countenance striking and even handsome.
Of great physical strength and vigor, he carried himself in a manly, self-possessed, dignified, and
serene manner, uniting a dignity which might rise at times even to hauteur, or even incipient
arrogance, with a general and customary affability.
His dress, like his complexion, was somewhat
His mind was active, alert, intense without being somber, penetrating, sound, fairly
florid.
cultivated, and well exercised in expression by pen or word. He was animated, habile, and atten
tive in conversation, self-possessed, steady, and calm in formal address. He was pre-eminently
a man of energy, intense and resistless, with a determination to accomplish whatever he attempted,
which rose under opposition to irresistible impetuosity, and wrought a courage which, in action,
was absolutely fearless.

His ambition was limitless, but not wholly or even mainly selfish.

With his energy and ambition were united the ballast of marked prudence, patience, perse
verance, faithfulness to details, steadfastness, and supreme self-control. He was amiable and
tactful, popular with his soldiers, and careful to please. Toward those who came into his power
he showed habitual mildness and forbearance, - a mildness so great that he was generally blamed
for it; and toward all he showed great kindness, justice, and a generosity which verged on the
lavish. He was open to the charge of over-generosity, almost of prodigality, a good measure of
real vanity, some over-insistence on his own will and thought as the final standard of right, and
by no means free from mistakes or human weaknesses. He was a good son, husband, father, a
remarkably successful general, a tolerable legislator, and a clear-sighted, firm-willed statesman. In
his religious life he abounded in creed and confession - believing in the Trinity, the Divinity of
Christ, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and Eternal Life, in Repentance and Faith, in love to
God, and love to man. He preached his faith on all occasions; he practiced thanksgiving and
prayer abundantly. He regarded everything that he had or was as from God. The editor's brief
judgment is that Constantine, for his time, made an astonishingly temperate, wise, and, on the
whole, benevolent use of absolute power, and in morality, kindly qualities, and, at last, in real
Christian character, greatly surpassed most nineteenth century politicians - standing to modern
statesmen as Athanasius to modern theologians.

WRITINGS.

§ 1.

Introduction.

Quite a number of works by this emperor-author are extant.' They may be grouped under,

1. Oratorical writings; 2. Letters and decrees; 3. Laws; 4. Various.

§ 2.

Oratorica/ Writings.

According to Eusebius (P. C. 4. 29; cf. 4. 55) these were very numerous, and it may well be
believed. He seems to have done much of everything he undertook at all - fighting, or learn
ing, or building temples, or making laws, he was nothing if not incessant. He had a habit of
inflicting his orations on his court, and undoubtedly had plenty of enthusiastic hearers, as any
emperor would, and as Eusebius says he did. They seem to have been generally philosophical
with as much religion as possible worked in (P. C. 4. 9).
Not many are extant, but we have
some account of the few following:

1. Oration to the saints (Oratio ad sanctum captum, S. C.).

For this see the following

translation and Special Prolegomena.

2. Address so the Council of AWicaca in praise of seace (Ad Syn. A'ic.), in Euseb. J. C. 3. 12.
Address of welcome. He rejoices in the assembly, and exhorts them to be united, that they may
thereby please God and do a favor to their emperor.

-

3. Oration to the Council of Nicaea, in Gelasius, Hist. Coun. Mic. I. 7.

Begins with rhetorical
comparison of the Church to a temple, and ends with injunctions to observe peace and to search
the Scriptures as the authority in all points of doctrine.

Appears dubiously authentic.

4. Address to the bishops on their departure from AWicaca.

Abstract in Euseb. P. C. 32. 1.

Exhorts them to keep peace, cautions against jealousy, &c.

5. Funeral oration. A description in Euseb. V. C. 4.55.

Dwells on the immortality of the

soul, the blessings laid up for those who love God, and the ruin of the ungodly.

His method of composition is spoken of by Eusebius (P. C. 4. 29), and his manner of
delivery may be gathered from Eusebius' description of his speech at the opening of the Council
of Nicaea (V. C. 3. 11).
For the style of his oratorical discourses, compare remarks on the
Oration to the Saints in the Special Prolegomena.

Letters and Edicts.

It is hard to separate between letters, edicts, and laws. A substantial autocrat, the form of
address was much the same, and the force. The extant letters are quite numerous, and those of
which we have definite or general mention, many. He seems to have been a most industrious

There are also quite a large number of letters mentioned with more or less description, and
a "multitude of letters " (V. C. 3. 24) of which there is no specific knowledge. Of the former
may be mentioned that to the inhabitants of Heliopolis, one to Valerius (or Valerianus or Verinus)
(Augustine, Ad Donat. A. c. c. 33); one to the Council of Tyre, asking them to hasten to Jeru

Zaws.

The numerous laws are collected in the edition of Migne (Patrol. Zaf. 8. p. 93-400), mainly
from the Theodosian code.
They are in the opinion of Eutropius (Io. 8) "many," "some
good and equitable, but most of them superfluous, and some severe" (cf. under Character).
Many of them show the author's tendency to declamation, but taken all in all they are business
like and do credit, in the main, to their author's heart, and even, though less conspicuously, to his
head.
For more specific account, compare the laws themselves as collected in Migne, the relat
ing passages in Wordsworth and Ceillier, standard and annotated editions of the codes, and
special treatises, such as Balduin, De leg. ecc/, et civ. 1737.

Various.

Besides the more formal works mentioned above, various conversations, sayings, bon mots,

prayers, &c., are preserved, among which may be mentioned :
1. Memoirs of himse//, of which no portion is extant.

Writings of Constantine are mentioned
by Lydus (p. 194, 226), but whether the writings referred to deserve the title given by Burck
hardt it is hard to say.

2. A sorm of prayer given by Constantine to his soldiers (V. C. 4. 20).
3. His address when the memorials of contendents, at Council of Nicaea, were brought to

him (Soz. I. 17).

4. The conversation with Acesius, for which Socrates vouches, closing, "O Acesius, set up a

ladder, and do you alone climb up to heaven."

5. His rebuke to the courtier concerning covetousness (V. C. 4. 30).

His works are interesting to study and not without a touch here and there of genuine
literary interest. A remark on friendship, for example, unless it be a product of his habit of bor
rowing the thoughts of other men more or less directly, is delightful and most quotable. "For
it often happens," he says, "that when a reconciliation is effected by the removal of the causes
of enmity, friendship becomes even sweeter than it was before " (Const. to Alex. and Ar. in

CHAPTER IV.

THE MYTHICAL CONSTANTINE.

THE many legends which have attached themselves to the name of Constantine are valuable
chiefly as curiosities, and can be treated here only in specimens. A few of the more interesting
and important are the following:

1.

Constantine and his Mother //e/ema.

A little anonymous work of some thirty pages, edited by Heydenreich from a fourteenth-century
manuscript, was published under this title in 1879, and has drawn forth an astonishing amount of
literature for so slight a thing.
It has little value except as an illustration of mediaeval romance,
though Coen seems to think the honor of having introduced it into literature enough to warrant
the expenditure of a good deal of pains in vindicating his claim to it. The story is written with
tolerable art, and runs, abbreviated, something as follows:

Helena, daughter of a noble family of Trèves, came on a pious journey to Rome. The
Emperor Constantius, crossing a bridge of the Tiber, saw Helena among other pilgrims.
Struck
with her beauty, he arranged that she should be detained by force at the inn where she stayed,
when her fellow-pilgrims returned to Gaul. The emperor then constrained her by force, but,
seeing the great grief which his act had caused, gave her a certain ornament of precious stones
and his ring, as a sort of pledge, and went away.
She did not venture to return to her country,
but remained at Rome with the son who was born to her, representing that her Gallic husband
Certain merchants,
was dead.
seeing his excellent quality, formed a scheme of making money by palming him off on the
emperor of the Greeks as a son-in-law, representing him to be a son of the Roman emperor.

This son, Constantine, grew up pleasing, handsome, and versatile.

The scheme was carried out, and the merchants after some time embarked again for Rome,
with the Constantine and the princess, and much treasure. Toward the end of their journey they

been deserted by the merchants, and Constantine in great grief confessed the deception which
had been practiced. To this the princess replied that she cared little who he was or his family,
since he was himself and her husband.
After a few days of short rations they were taken by
passing voyagers to Rome, where they joined Helena, and having purchased a house with the
proceeds from the sale of certain valuables which the princess had kept with her, they went to
hotel-keeping.
Constantine took naturally to military life, and at tournaments surpassed every
one else so far as to arouse astonishment and inquiry. The emperor would not believe him a

came out, confirmed by the ring which the emperor had given Helena.
Constantius first had
the merchants put to death, and gave all their property to Constantine. Then a treaty was made
with the emperor of the East, and Constantine was recognized as heir to the empire.

A more wildly unhistorical historical novel could hardly have been written even by a Muhlbach.

For further account, see under Literature especially articles by Heydenreich and by Coen.

2. Constantine the Son of a British Princess.

Duke Coel of Colchester, say the old chronicles, by an insurrection became king.

The

Constantius was crowned, married

her he had a son, Constantine, afterwards called the Great.
This is in substance the account of
Geoffrey of Monmouth (5. 6) and Pierre de Langloft (1, p. 66-7). The story is mentioned by

-

PROLEGOMENA.

Henry of Huntington (Bk. I. 37), who perhaps wrote before Geoffrey (in 1137 [?]), and Richard
of Cirencester (2.1. 33).
Waurin (Vol. I, Bk. 2. 43) makes "Choel" Count of Leicester, but in
general is identical with Geoffrey. The famous Brut of Layamon (ed. Madden, 2 [1847] p. 35)
is translated with amplifications from Wace's Brut, and this in turn from Geoffrey.
This makes
Coel Earl of Gloucester. The Eulogium Hist, calls Helena (1.337) daughter of a British king,
but also concubine, though elsewhere (2, p. 267) she is wife according to the conventional story.
It is interesting that this

legendary father of Helena is supposed (Hayden, Index to Eulogium, p. 45, and Giles, note on -
Geoffrey, p. 162) to be the same as "Old King Cole, the merry old soul," making Constantine
thus the grandson of the Mother Goose hero.

3. Constantine's Zeprosy; //easing and Baptism by Silvester.

This tale is one of the most frequently found. The earliest account is said to be that of the
Acts of Silvester. Some of the many who repeat it are Ephraem, Cedrenus, Zonaras. The fol
lowing account is mainly from Glycas, p. 461-462.

When Constantine was fighting against Maxentius, after he had seen the sign of the cross, he
was victorious.
Then, forgetting, he was conquered, and grieving, he sell asleep and had a vision
in which the blow of a switch on his nostrils brought blood which flowed down on his linen tunic

Being led away a second time into idolatry through his wife Fausta, he was divinely afflicted with
leprosy. The priests prescribed a bath in the blood of infants, and it was ordered; but when
he heard the lamentations of the mothers, he said it was better to suffer than that so many infants

him Silvester would cure him, as he did.
There are many varieties of the story and various details
as to baptism, but in general the whole series of stories regarding his baptism at Rome centers in
this story, and gratitude for this cure is the supposed occasion of the famous donation of Con
stantine.
In this the circumstances of the miracle are given at length, - the words of the
apostles, Silvester's identification of them as apostles by portraits, the immersion, and subsequent
instruction.

4. Donation of Constantine.

doubting (De Monarch. 4. Io), he does not venture to dispute this. He denies, however, Con
stantine's power or right to give, if he did give.
In modern times the fictitious character of the
document is recognized by Protestants and Catholics alike, and the discussion, so vigorous for

CONSTANTINE THE GREAT.

merly, over this authenticity has narrowed itself chiefly to a discussion of the place (France or
Rome) and date (653-753, ninth century) and possible author. The discussion over these points
has been lately renewed and is being carried on with animation. Among the later monographs
are those of Martens (1889) and Friedrich (1889, not at hand). The latest treatise at hand is
that of Seeberg in the Theol. Literaturbl. of Jan. 17. 24. 31 of the current year.
For farther
select literature, compare Verzeichniss in Martens; for sources, the chapters of Martens and Preface
of Bonneau; for older literature, Muensch. p. 96-97, and in general the Literature of Constantine,

there.
Treatises on the Donation will be found under the names of Albani, Altus, Arrhenius,
Bachmann, Bayet, Bonneau, Brunner, Chaulnes, Colombier, Cusa, Friedrich, Genelin, Grauert,

5. Dream concerning the Founding of Constantinople.

"As Constantine was sleeping in this city [Byzantium], he imagined that there stood before
him an old woman whose forehead was furrowed with age; but that presently, clad in an imperial
robe, she became transformed into a beautiful girl, and so fascinated his eyes by the elegance of
her youthful charms that he could not refrain from kissing her; that Helena, his mother, being
present, then said, "She shall be yours forever; nor shall she die till the end of time." The
solution of this dream, when he awoke, the emperor extorted from heaven, by fasting and alms
giving. And behold, within eight days, being cast again into a deep sleep, he thought he saw
Pope Silvester, who died some little time before, regarding his convert with complacency, and
saying, ‘You have acted with your customary prudence in waiting for a solution from God of
that enigma which was beyond the comprehension of man. The old woman you saw is this city,
worn down by age, whose time-struck walls, menacing approaching ruin, require a restorer.
But
you, renewing its walls, and its affluence, shall signalize it also with your name; and here shall
Lond.
the imperial progeny reign forever'" (William of Malmesbury, Chronicle, tr. English.
1847, p. 372-3. The final section, which instructs Constantine how to lay out the city, is omitted).
This is taken by the Chronicler from Aldhelm's (d. 709) de laudibus virginitatis (c. 52, ed.
Giles, 1844, p. 28-29), where, however, instead of kissing her, he much more appropriately
"clothes her with his mantle, and puts his diadem adorned with pure gold and brilliant gems on
her head."
It is given also by Ralph de Diceto (ed. Stubbs, Lond. 1876), 74-75, and probably
by many others.

Voyage of Aeelena.

A matter-of-fact account of things which are not so, given in Hakluyt's Voyages, 2 (1810),

p. 34, is worth giving in the words of the translator:

-

"Helena Flavia Augusta, the heire and onely daughter of Coelus, sometime the most excellent
king of Britaine, by reason of her singular beautie, faith, religion, goodnesse, and godly Maiestie
(according to the testimonie of Eusebius) was famous in all the world. Amongst all the women
of her time there was none either in the liberall arts more learned, or in the instruments of

7. The Finding of the Cross.

It is said in a certain "tolerably authentic chronicle," according to Voragine, that Constantine
sent his mother Helena to Jerusalem to try to find the cross on which our Lord was crucified.
When she arrived, she bade all the Jewish Rabbis of the whole land gather to meet her.
Great
was their fear. They suspected that she sought the wood of the cross, a secret which they had
promised not to reveal even under torture, because it would mean the end of Jewish supremacy.
When they met her, sure enough, she asked for the place of the crucifixion. When they would

and instigator, saying that he could tell.
She gave him his choice of telling or dying by starvation.
At first he was obstinate, but six days of total abstinence from food brought him to terms, and on
the seventh he promised. He was conducted to the place indicated, and in response to prayer,
there was a sort of earthquake, and a perfume filled the air which converted Judas. There was a
temple of Venus on the spot.
This the queen had destroyed. Then Judas set to digging vigor
ously, and at the depth of twenty feet, found three crosses, which he brought to Helena. The
true cross was tested by its causing a man to rise from the dead, or according to others, by heal

Cyriacus. Then Helena set him hunting for the nails of the cross. He found them shining like
gold and brought them to the queen, who departed, taking them and a portion of the wood of
She brought the nails to Constantine, who put them on his bridle and helmet, or
the cross.
according to another account, two were used in this way, and one was thrown into the Adriatic Sea.
It is interesting to trace the melancholy consequences of this particular enterprise of Constan
tine's in the sad death of St. Cyriacus née Judas. The Emperor Julian, the apostate, "invited "
him to sacrifice to idols. When he refused, melted lead was poured into his mouth; then an iron
bedstead was brought, on which he was stretched, while a fire was built underneath and the
body of the martyr larded with salt and fat. The saint did not budge, and Julian had a deep
well dug, which was filled with venomous serpents.
But contact with the saint killed the ser
pents, and a cauldron of boiling oil succeeded.
Julian was so angry at the alacrity and cheerful

ness of the saint's preparations for this bath, that he killed him with a blow of his sword.
is some consolation in the thought of this premature death, in the fact that, unless his claim that
he was nephew to Stephen, the Proto-martyr, be disallowed, he had reached a ripe old age of two
hundred and fifty years or thereabouts.

The literature on this legend is very great. The finding of the cross is mentioned as early as
Cyril of Jerusalem (ab. 347-35o), within twenty-five years of the visit of Helena recorded by
Eusebius (V. C. 3. 26), and with great frequency afterwards. The failure of any mention by
Eusebius seems, however, conclusive against any finding, or pretended finding, at the time of
Helena's famous visit, though the contrary is acutely argued by Newman. The finding and use
of the nails is often separated from the other, and is found in many of the sources on Constantine.
But even those who believe in the miracle of the finding of the cross will hardly vouch for the
story in the above form, which is substantially that of Voragine.

Compare Sinker's article, Cross, Finding of, in Smith and Cheetham, Dics. I (1880), 503-506;
Jameson, Hist, of Our Lord, 2 (1872) 385-391; Newman, Essays on Miracles (Lond. 1875)
287-326; and especially Voragine, whom see under Sources. Under the article Hesena, in Smith
& W. is a sub-article by Argles on the Invention of the Cross, which gives an admirable abstract
of the sources in order.

These examples of the stories which have gathered around the name of Constantine do not

CONSTANTINE THE CREAT.

begin to exhaust the list. The interesting tales of the sword of Constantine presented to Athel
stan (Aeeg. Malms. 1, 1879, p. 55, 468; Eu/, //ist. 3, 1863, p. 12), his conversion through
remorse, and the whole series of allusions and stories in mediaeval fiction and poetry must be
passed here.
If any one has the curiosity to follow them up, he will find the references in the
articles of Heydenreich a good guide to literature. A few stories, like that of Constantine and
Tiridates, one hesitates to class among the wholly fictitious (compare, under Sources, Agathan
gelos, Zenobius, and Faustus).

CHAPTER V.

SOURCES AND LITERATURE.

§ 1.

Introduction.

THE insertion in such a work as this of what seems almost technical in its character has this
twofold purpose: first, to give a glimpse of the grounds of our knowledge of Constantine, with a
view of how far and in what directions it has been worked out through literature; second, to
serve the expressed purpose of this series, of encouraging farther study in its lines. The very
knowledge of what the sources are, and their character, apart from any special study of them,
gives a width of horizon and definiteness of conception to the general student, which can hardly
be gotten in any other way; while for any one who plans farther study in any line, it is of first
importance to find the what and where of his material.

§ 2.

Sources.

Remembering the class of students for which the series is chiefly intended, effort has been
made to refer to translations of sources where they are at hand, and to refer to the best accessible
But the plan has been to refer to the source itself in the edition

actually used, and for literature on them to choose the best for ready reference.
Both editions
and authorities on sources are therefore selections, usually from many, of such as seem most
directly useful. The intention has been to guide to all frequently mentioned sources, whether
they were of great value or not, since a useless one costs often quite as much trouble to hunt up
and find useless, as a good one to use.
It is hardly to be hoped that all the sources often
referred to have been gathered, but the following list represents pretty much all that are worth
mentioning, and some which are not.

1.

Inscriptions, coins, medals, &c.

In some sense these are the most reliable of sources, in spite of counterfeits. A large number will be found col
lected in Clinton.
For farther critical study, compare the collections, great and small; for which, with the matter
of inscriptions in general, see Hicks, E. L., and Hübner, E., in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 13 (1881) 121133; and Babington, in Smith and Cheetham, I (1880) 841-862.
Monographs on those relating to Constantine
will be found under the names, Cavedoni, Cigola, Eltz, Freherus, Garucci, Harduin, Penon, Revellot, Valois,
Westphalen, Werveke, in the Ziferature of this volume.

These, with their dates, their official nature, their fullness and variety, are primary, and are the only sources
recognized by some. They are embodied in the Theodosian and Justinian Codes, and collected from these are

Taking in general chronological order, without attempting the impossibility of fixing the exact chronological
place, the first group of contemporary sources is that of the Panegyrists (for collected editions, see Engelmann).

PROLEGOMENA.

It was a serious mistake, now recognized, to pass them by as worthless.
Like all authentic documents, they
have a minimum residuum of undoubted material, which is larger or smaller according to the critical acumen of
the investigator.
In the case of these, however inflated or eulogistic they may be, the circumstances under which
they were spoken give a considerable value.

In Migne, Patrol. Lat.

Besides having
the great value of being contemporary evidence, the author shows a certain ingenuity in enlarging on the virtues
of the young Constantine, who had few deeds to show, and on the deeds of Maximian, who had few virtues, and
has therefore a certain discernible modicum of truth.

and Constantine. He was head of the school at Autun. The Panegyric was delivered at Treves, in 31o. The
authorship of Eumenius has been unwarrantably questioned, on the ground that the flattery and exaggeration of the
work are not consistent with his taste and sense; but it would seem that both his exaggeration and his taste have
been themselves exaggerated.
His praise is hardly more "outrageous" than panegyrics were wont to be, - or are,
for that matter; and so far from being "worthless," there is a peculiar deal of interesting, unquestionable, and
primary historical evidence.
Still, his taste and veracity are not much above that of modern eulogists of living or
dead emperors and politicians. The Grafiarum Actio is the official oration of thanks to Constantine in behalf
of the citizens of Autun, on account of favors shown them.

editions in collected works, and about a dozen separate, and many translations, - in all a hundred or more
editions and translations. There has been much controversy regarding the author of this work, but there is little
doubt that it was Lactantius.
Ebert (Gesch. chr. Lat. Zit. 1. 83) claims to have demonstrated the fact, and most
of the later writers agree. The work was composed after the edict of Constantine and Licinius, and before the
break between the two, i.e. 313-314. It was written thus in the midst of things, and has the peculiar historical value
of a contemporary document, unprejudiced by later events.
It is a sort of psalm of triumph, colored by the pas
sionate rejoicing of one persecuted over the Divine vengeance which has come upon the persecutors. "In the use
of the work the historian must employ great critical discernment'' (Ebert, in Herzog, 8 [1881], 365).
But granted
all his prejudice, the facts he witnesses are of first value.

His testimony, though brief, is of peculiar weight from

It was early remarked (Nicephorus Gregoras) that
his position for knowing and from a certain flavor of fairness.
his praise of Constantine had peculiar force, coming from a heathen and friend of Julian.
His dispraise, on the
other hand, is conditioned by the fact that he applies it only to the period after Constantine began peculiarly
to favor the Christians. He seems to be a cool, level-headed man of the world, unsympathetic with Constantine's
religion, and, writing from this standpoint, presents a just, candid, reliable account of him.

It will be safe to divide extremes. He is a heathen who, on the period of Constantine, draws from an
anti-Christian and anti-Constantinian source, and who regards the introduction of Christianity as a chief cause of the
decline of the Roman Empire (cf. various passages cited by Milligan). He is prejudiced against Christianity with
the bitter prejudice of one who finds himself in a steadily narrowing minority, and he is occasionally credulous.
But he wrote in a clear, interesting style, without intentional falsifications, and was quite as moderate as the Chris
tian writer (Evagrius, 3.41) who calls Zosimus himself a "fiend of hell."
His extended account is therefore of
great value among the sources, and especially as it is probably drawn in large measure from the earlier lost work
of Eunapius.

It has been conjectured (Müller, p. 1538) that Eutropius and Johannes copied from a common
Greek source; but the curious error in the section on Constantine (p. 603), by which "commodae" is converted
into a proper name, and becomes the name of the sister whose son Constantine put to death, shows it to have been
translated from the Latin. The work of Johannes has, however, some interesting suggestions and additions; e.g.
its paraphrase of the word "dubius" in the characterization of Constantine's conduct towards his friends.

1864). Nothing is known of his personal history. The work is a chronicle from the beginning of the world until
1057 A.D. He mentions as his chief sources Georgius Syncellus, "until the time of Maximianus and Maximinus,"
and from this point Theophanes, Siculus, Psellus, and others (cf. p. 4; cf. also Glycas. Chron., ed. Bonn. p. 457),
and claims to have collected facts not in these sources. He mentions the work of Joannes Thracesius, or Curopa
lates, who is probably Scylitzes, whose work corresponds so exactly with that of Cedrenus in parts as to suggest the
one or the other a better copier than compiler. The statement of Ceillier is that Cedrenus copied the work of
Scylitzes for the period 811-1057, and that Scylitzes afterwards continued his work to 1081; i.e. there was a double
edition of the work of Scylitzes, and Cedrenus wrote between.
But Means (p. 760) thinks otherwise, and gives
good reasons, making one edition and placing Cedrenus' work later, i.e. after 1081. The "additional facts" are
few, the compilation is uncritical and credulous; but the work is recognized as a source to be consulted, though
with greatest critical care.

passages are identical, almost word for word, with Cedrenus.
In one of these passages the author refers to Socrates
as his authority, while there is no such mention in Cedrenus. They may have taken from the same source. At all
events, this work appears on its face much more like sober history than do Cedrenus and Zonaras.

Literature.

Even with this limit it cannot be at all hoped that the list is exhaustive.

In making the following thread to the rich literature on Constantine the plan has been to con
fine almost wholly to Monographs, since to refer to all histories, encyclopaedias, and the like which
Only such few analyzed references are introduced as have special
treat of him would be endless.
reasons.
Considerable
pains has been taken, however, to make it full, as there is no really extended modern list of
works on Constantine, excepting, perhaps, Chevalier (Rép. des sources hist du Moyen Age). The
effort was made to see each work referred to personally, but the libraries of London, Oxford,
Berlin, Paris, could not supply them, and after a good deal of search in other libraries and more
or less successful effort to purchase, there is still a considerable portion which has not been seen.
The editor has tried in vain to decide in various instances whether praeses or respondent is
author in certain dissertations.

NoTE 1. - The number of works which have suggested themselves as really necessary to complete a working
list for the student of Constantine is very great. Some works like HEFELE's Conciliengeschichte seem indispensable,
others like HARNAck's article in Herzog, Encykl on the Aonstantinopolitanisches Symbol have a very important
correlative bearing, and ought really to be especially mentioned because the general student would not readily find
them out.
Several works on the historical value of Eusebius' Life of Constantine, also should really have been
inserted. The latest of these is:

For farther literature on special points compare references in the notes.

NoTE 2. - The attempt to secure accuracy in the above list has proved one of great difficulty.

All references
could not be verified, and as "conjectural emendation " is even more dangerous in bibliography than in textual
criticism, readings have not generally been changed excepting on what seemed actual evidence. The only way to
avoid laying oneself open to criticism in making a bibliography is not to make it. The editor can only say for this
that a great deal of pains has been expended on improving accuracy as well as in gathering titles and annotating.
The difficulty is shown in the fact that the work quoted on the double authority of Oettinger and of Chevalier as
by Janus, proves on securing the work itself, after the list is in plate, to be really by Vogt and dedicated to Janus.

The first English translation of Eusebius was by Merideth Hanmer (compare Prolegomena
of Dr. McGiffert). The first editions of Hanmer did not contain the Life of Constantine.
It is
a little hard to distinguish the early editions, but there were at least three, and perhaps four,
editions (1577 (76), 1585 (84), 1607, 1619 P), before there was added in 1637 to the 1636
edition ("fourth edition " not "fifth edition 1650," as Wood, Ashena Oxon.), a translation by
Wye Saltonstall as follows:

It was again reprinted,
quoted often (e.g. Hoffmann) as 1650. The Life occupies p. 1-74.
Zondon, 1656, fol., it is said, revised and enlarged. The former editions having become exhausted,
it was proposed to re-edit and republish Hanmer's (Saltonstall's) version, but the editor found
it "a work of far greater labor to bring Dr. Hanmer's Zorans/ation to an agreement with the
Greek Text of Walesius' Edition, than to make a Mew One," which latter thing he accordingly
did and did well.

This translation is in somewhat inflated style, which perhaps represents Eusebius
and Constantine better than a simpler one, but which sometimes out-Herods Herod, as, e.g. in
the oration of Constantine, p. 279, where it takes fourteen English words to express seven Greek
ones, "Far otherwise has it been during the corrupt and lawless period of human life" for "It
was not thus in lawless times." A quotation from Matthew (xxvi. 52) on p. 267 takes eight words
in the original, twelve in the 1881 Revised Version, sixteen in the phrase of Constantine, and
twenty-two in this translation. The translation is made from the edition of Valesius, not the first
of Heinichen, as appears from the division of Bk. I, chap. Io, and similar peculiarities. The present
edition (1890) is a revision of the translation of 1845 founded on the edition of Heinichen.

4. Author and dase.

Almost no fact of history is unquestioned ;

therefore the unquestionable authorship of
Eusebius has been questioned.
Some have made the author Macarius (compare Vogt. Hist.
lit. p. 12), evidently on the ground of the letter (3.52) which the author says was addressed
to himself, but which is to Macarius and others, but there is no real doubt of the Eusebian

authorship.
and 34o, when Eusebius died. The interesting hypothesis of Meyer (p. 28) that it was perhaps
written mainly in Constantine's lifetime, at the suggestion and under the direction of Constantine,
to defend him against charges brought, or which might be brought, against him, is worth men
tioning, although it is more ingenious than probable. The headings of the chapters are by
another, though probably not much later, and a competent hand (cf. Lightfoot).

5. Trustworthiness of Eusebius.

The value of a writer is determined by (1) His sources of knowledge, (2) His own intel

posed for that work has been truly fulfilled.
A man who attempts a treatise on Geometry
is not to be criticised because he omits mention of sulphuric acid, or if he purposes a descrip
tion of Wagner's music, because he does not produce a Helmholtz on Sound. The application
of these principles to Eusebius' Life of Constantine requires brief examination of 1. The pro
posed scope of the work.
3. The intellectual and moral
competency of Eusebius in the premises.

2. The character of the sources.

(1) The Scope of the Work.

This is quite definitely outlined (1.11).

In contrast with those
who have recorded the evil deeds of other emperors and thus have "become to those who by
some favor had been kept apart from evil, teachers not of good, but of what should be silenced
in oblivion and darkness," he proposes to record the noble actions of this emperor. He pro
poses, however, to pass over many things, - his wars, personal bravery, victories, and successes,
his legislative acts, and many other things, and confine himself to such things as have reference to
his religious character.
His aim, therefore, is distinctly limited to his religious acts, and it is
not stretching his meaning too far to say, expressly limited to his virtuous actions.

(2) Character of the Sources. The advantages which Eusebius had for knowing of the life
of Constantine, especially of his religious acts, could hardly be surpassed. He lived in the midst
of the events which he records, was personal friend of the emperor, received letters from him
directly, and had every opportunity to gather the other letters and documents which form so
large a part of his history (cf. V. C. I. Io).

(3) Competency of Eusebius.

Respecting this there is endless controversy. The fullness of
material is unquestionable, the intellectual competency of Eusebius is almost equally so, and
the questionings regard mainly whether the author has made a proper use of material.
Opinions
are various, but this does not mean that they are equally well grounded and valuable. Some of
Crivellucci (Livorno, 1888) calls it an historical novel,
the latest judgments are the most severe.
and Görres, in a review of Crivellucci, agrees that it is worth less than the Panegyrics of Eumenius
and Nazarius, which is certainly milder than Manso's (p. 222) "more shameless and lying" than
these.
Right or wrong, this is a frequently repeated view. Some (Hely, p. 141) cannot speak
too strongly of the "contempt" which he "deserves," and accuse of "pious fraud" or the next
thing to it (Kestner, 1816, p. 67).
For farther criticisms consult the works cited by Dr. McGiffert
under Ziferature, and the special works on Eusebius cited in the Ziferature to Constantine above,
passim. The criticisms group generally around 1. The suppression of the facts respecting the

and coloring of the work, especially the very pietistic saintly sort of flavor given to Constantine.

As to the suppression of facts, note (1) That he gives entire warning of his plan.

It would

not reflect on the general trustworthiness of what is said.
(2) No similar judgment is passed on
Eutropius, the Victors, Anonymous Walesianus or Zosimus, for not mentioning his pious acts.
(3) A comparison of most biographies of living or recently dead presidents, kings, and em
perors will be greatly to the advantage, even, of this fourth century eulogist over those of our
boasted critical age.

As to eulogistic and exaggerated tone, observe (1) That it was more or less justified. That
is, the premises of the criticism which are substantially that Constantine was not saintly or pie

pares well with modern eulogists and extremely well with the contemporary Panegyrists of Con
stantine.
(3) That Eusebius takes care frequently to guard his statements by quoting his source,
as in the matter of the vision of the cross, or by ascribing to hearsay.

In general, the work stands very much on the same level as the biographies of generals in the
late civil war, or of presidents, written by admiring members of their staffs or cabinets, incorporat

phrase show at least a consistent attitude of mind. The work is, in brief, by a competent
author, from ample sources and without intentional falsification or misrepresentation.
It prob
ably represents the current Christian view of the man as accurately and honestly as any biog
raphy of Lincoln or the Emperor William written within a year or two of their deaths has done.
As we now think of these two men whom doubtless inquisitive criticism might find to have
faults, so the Christians in general and his friend Eusebius in particular probably thought of the
Great Emperor.
Compare discussion and literature of the trustworthiness of Eusebius as a
historical writer in the Prolegomena of Dr. McGiffert in this volume.

Value of the work.

That the work on any basis but the untenable one of out-and-out forgery should be character
ized as "worthless" or "a mere romance" or "of less value than the heathen panegyrists" is a
curious bit of psychological performance, for it does precisely what it grounds its contempt for
Eusebius on, - suppresses and exaggerates.
Taking the minimum residuum of the most penetrat
ing criticism, and the work is yet a source of primary value for understanding the man Constantine.
This residuum includes (1) The documents which the work contains. These amount at the very least
estimate to more than one-fourth of the whole matter, and the appended oration of Constantine is
nearly as much more.
(2) Many facts and details where there could be no possibility of motive
for falsifying.

(3) Much which critical care can draw out of the over-statements of eulogy.

§ 2.

ORATION OF CONSTANTINE.

The Editions and Translations of this work are substantially identical with those of the Life.
See above, under Life. The Authenticity of the work has been doubted, and its composition
ascribed to Eusebius or some other Christian writer, but without sufficient reason.
It was
appended by Eusebius to his Life of Constantine as specimens of the latter's style (cf. V. C. 4.
As such it shows a man of some learning, though learning taken at second hand, it is
32).
It was composed in Latin,
thought, from Lactantius and others (cf. Wordsworth's Constantine I.).
and translated into Greek by the special officials appointed for such work (V. C. 4. 32).
It was
delivered on Good Friday, but in what year or where is not known.
It has been placed before
the year 324 (Ceiller, 130), but the mention of events and the character of the work itself
suggest a considerably later date.

§ 3.

ORATION OF EUSEBIUs.

The Editions and 7% ans/ations are substantially as those of the Life, above, but some of the
earlier ones do not contain this work.
It was delivered in the year 336 (or possibly 335) at
Constantinople, in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of Constantine's accession, Constan
tine himself being present (cf. V. C. 4. 46 and O. C. 1).
It gave the emperor lively satisfaction,
from which one may safely infer a peculiar taste for combined panegyric and philosophical
According to this hypothesis the work
theology unless the hypothesis of a double work be true.
consists of two separate orations, spoken perhaps at different times, the first including chapters
1-1 o, which are panegyrical in character, and the other chapters 11-18, which are theological
(compare Lightfoot, Eusebius, p. 343; also McGiffert, Prolegomena, p. 43).
It is like the oration
of Constantine, a proper part of the Life of Constantine being appended according to his promise
in Bk. 4, ch. 46.

THE

LIFE

OF

The

BLESSED EMPEROR CONSTANTINE,

BY

EU SEBIUS PAMPHILI.

BOOK I.

CHAPTER I.

Preface. - Of the Death of Constantine.

ALREADY" have all mankind united in celebrat
ing with joyous festivities the completion of the
second and third decennial period of this great
emperor's reign ;
already have we ourselves
received him as a triumphant conqueror in the
assembly of God's ministers, and greeted him
with the due meed of praise on the twentieth
anniversary of his reign : * and still more re
cently we have woven, as it were, garlands of
words, wherewith we encircled his sacred head
in his own palace on his thirtieth anniversary."

But now, while I desire "to give utterance to
some of the customary sentiments, I stand per

* Literally "recently "or "not long since," and so it is rendered
by Tr. 1709, Stroth, Molzberger, Walesius ("nuper"), and Por
tesius.
Christophorson and Cousin avoid the awkwardness by cir
cumlocution or simple omission, while our translator shows his one
characteristic excellence of hitting nearly the unliteral meaning in a
way which is hard to improve.

* The assembly referred to was the Council of Nicaea. Constan
tine's vicennial celebration was held at Nicomedia during the session
of the Council at Nicaea (July 25), according to Hieronymus and
others, but celebrated again at Rome the following year. The
Valesius
thinks the one spoken of in the J . C. 3. 11, as delivered in the
presence of the council, is the one referred to.

ech of Eusebius on this occasion is not preserved.

* This oration is the one appended by Eusebius to this Life of

Constantine, and given in this translation (cf. P. C. 4. 46).

* [In the text it is 6 Aóyos, "my power of speech, or of descrip
tion, much desires," and so throughout this preface: but this kind
of personification seems scarcely suited to the English, idiom.-
#: This usage of Logos is most interesting.
th he and his
friend, the emperor, are fond of dwelling on the circles of philo
sophical thought which center about the word Logos (cf. the Oration
of Constantine, and especially the Vicennial Oration of Eusebius).
"My Logos desires" seems to take the place in ancient philosophi
cal slang which "personality" or "self" does in modern.
In an
cient usage the word includes "both the ratio and the oratio" (Lid
dell and Scott), both the thought and its expression, both reasoning
and saying, - the "internal '' and "expressed" of the Stoics, fol
lowed by Philo and early Christian theology.
He seems to use
it in the combined sense, and it makes a pretty good equivalent for
"personality," "my personality desires," &c. The idiom is kept
up through the chapter.

plexed and doubtful which way to turn, being
wholly lost in wonder at the extraordinary spec
tacle before me.
For to whatever quarter I
direct my view, whether to the east, or to the
west, or over the whole world, or toward heaven
itself, everywhere and always I see the blessed
one yet administering the self-same empire.
On earth I behold his sons, like some new
reflectors of his brightness, diffusing everywhere
the luster of their father's character," and him
self still living and powerful, and governing all
the affairs of men more completely than ever
before, being multiplied in the succession of his
children. They had indeed had previously the
dignity of Caesars;" but now, being invested
with his very self, and graced by his accomplish
ments, for the excellence of their piety they are
proclaimed by the titles of Sovereign, Augustus,
Worshipful, and Emperor.

CHAPTER II.

The Preface continued.

AND I am indeed amazed, when I consider
that he who was but lately visible and present
with us in his mortal body, is still, even after
death, when the natural thought disclaims every
thing superfluous as unsuitable, most marvelously
endowed with the same imperial dwellings, and
But farther,
honors, and praises as heretofore.'

* Constantine II., Constantius, and Constans proved on the

whole sorry reflectors of glory.

* The first had been Caesar more than twenty years; the second,

ten; and the third, less than five.

CONSTANTINE.

[I. 2.

when I raise my thoughts even to the arch of
heaven, and there contemplate his thrice-blessed
soul in communion with God himself, freed
from every mortal and earthly vesture, and shin
ing in a refulgent robe of light, and when I
perceive that it is no more connected with the
fleeting periods and occupations of mortal life,
but honored with an ever-blooming crown, and
an immortality of endless and blessed existence,
I stand as it were without power of speech or
thought" and unable to utter a single phrase, but
condemning my own weakness, and imposing
silence on myself, I resign the task of speaking
his praises worthily to one who is better able,
even to him who, being the immortal God and
veritable Word, alone has power to confirm his
own sayings."

CHAPTER III.

How God honors Pious Princes, but destroys
Zyrants.

HAVING given assurance that those who glorify
and honor him will meet with an abundant
recompense at his hands, while those who set
themselves against him as enemies and adversa
ries will compass the ruin of their own souls, he
has already established the truth of these his
own declarations, having shown on the one hand
the fearful end of those tyrants who denied and
opposed him,' and at the same time having
made it manifest that even the death of his
servant, as well as his life, is worthy of admira
tion and praise, and justly claims the memorial,
not merely of perishable, but of immortal monu
ments.

Mankind, devising some consolation for the
frail and precarious duration of human life, have
thought by the erection of monuments to glorify
the memories of their ancestors with immortal
honors. Some have employed the vivid deline
ations and colors of painting *; some have
carved statues from lifeless blocks of wood ;
while others, by engraving their inscriptions
deep on tablets* and monuments, have thought

* Here there is play on the word Logos. My logos stands voice
less and a-logos, "un-logosed."
If the author meant both to refer
to expression, the first relates to the sound, and the second to the
power of construction or composition. The interchangeableness of
the weaving of consecutive thought in the mind, and the weaving it
in expressed words, is precisely the question of the "relation of
thought and language," so warmly contested by modern philoso
hers and philologians (cf. Müller, Science of Thought, Shedd's
yo s, &c.). The old use of logos for both operations of "binding
together" various ideas into one synthetical form has decided advan
tages.

* Here there is again the play on the word Logos.

For Euse.
bius' philosophy of the logos, and of Christ as the Logos or Word,
see the second half of his tricennial oration and notes.

* Compare Lactantius, />e mortions persecutorum, which doubt

less the author had in mind.

* I Knooxvrov Ypsi bos, properly encaustic painting, by means of
melted wax. - Bag. l. Compare admirable description of the pro
cess in the Century Dictionary, ed. Whitney, N.Y. 1889, v. 2.

* R v Bets, at first used of triangular tablets of wood, brass, or stone,

but afterwards of any inscribed "pillars or tablets."

to transmit the virtues of those whom they
honored to perpetual remembrance.
All these
indeed are perishable, and consumed by the
lapse of time, being representations of the cor
ruptible body, and not expressing the image of
the immortal soul. And yet these seemed suffi
cient to those who had no well-grounded hope
of happiness after the termination of this mortal
life.
But God, that God, I say, who is the com
mon Saviour of all, having treasured up with
himself, for those who love godliness, greater
blessings than human thought has conceived,
gives the earnest and first-fruits of future re
wards even here, assuring in some sort immortal
hopes to mortal eyes. The ancient oracles of
the prophets, delivered to us in the Scripture,
declare this ; the lives of pious men, who shone
in old time with every virtue, bear witness to
posterity of the same ; and our own days prove
it to be true, wherein CONSTANTINE, who alone
of all that ever wielded the Roman power was
the friend of God the Sovereign of all, has ap
peared to all mankind so clear an example of a
godly life.

CHAPTER IV.

That God honored Constantime.

AND God himself, whom Constantine wor
shiped, has confirmed this truth by the clearest
manifestations of his will, being present to aid
him at the commencement, during the course,
and at the end of his reign, and holding him up
to the human race as an instructive example of
godliness.
Accordingly, by the manifold bless
ings he has conferred on him, he has distin
guished him alone of all the sovereigns of whom
we have ever heard as at once a mighty lumi
nary and most clear-voiced herald of genuine
piety.

CHAPTER V.

That he reigned above Thirty Years, and lived
above Sixty.

WITH respect to the duration of his reign, God
honored him with three complete periods of ten
years, and something more, extending the whole
term of his mortal life to twice this number of
years.' And being pleased to make him a rep
resentative of his own sovereign power, he dis
played him as the conqueror of the whole race
of tyrants, and the destroyer of those God
defying giants" of the earth who madly raised

aid," covers the idea better than "graciously present" (Molz).

THE LIFE OF CONSTANTINE.

their impious arms against him, the supreme
King of all. They appeared, so to speak, for
an instant, and then disappeared : while the one
and only true God, when he had enabled his
servant, clad in heavenly panoply, to stand
singly against many foes, and by his means had
relieved mankind from the multitude of the
ungodly, constituted him a teacher of his wor
ship to all nations, to testify with a loud voice
in the hearing of all that he acknowledged the
true God, and turned with abhorrence from the
error of them that are no gods.

CHAPTER VI.

That he was the Servant of God, and the Con
queror of Mations.

THUS, like a faithful and good servant, did he
act and testify, openly declaring and confessing
himself the obedient minister of the supreme
King. And God forthwith rewarded him, by
making him ruler and sovereign, and victorious
to such a degree that he alone of all rulers pur
sued a continual course of conquest, unsubdued
and invincible, and through his trophies a greater
ruler than tradition records ever to have been
So dear was he to God, and so blessed ;
before.
So pious and so fortunate in all that he under
took, that with the greatest facility he obtained
the authority over more nations than any who
had preceded him,' and yet retained his power,
undisturbed, to the very close of his life.

CHAPTER VII.

Comparison with Cyrus, King of the Persians,
and with Alexander of Macedon.

ANCIENT history describes Cyrus, king of the
Persians, as by far the most illustrious of all
kings up to his time. And yet if we regard the
end of his days,' we find it but little corresponded
with his past prosperity, since he met with an
inglorious and dishonorable death at the hands
of a woman."

-

It is used
to the mythical Gigantes who fought against the gods.
in the same sense in which AFschylus uses it of Capaneus (Theb.
424), who defied Zeus in declaring that even his thunderbolts should
not keep him out of Thebes.

* Compare the various wars against Franks, Bructerians, Goths,
Sarmatians and others mentioned in Life in Prolegomena. Com
pare also chapter 8 of this book.

. [Such seems to be the probable meaning of this passage, which
is manifestly corrupt, and of which various emendations have been

Perhaps better paraphrased, "But since the test
of blessedness lies not in this, but in his end, we look and find

that this." The key to the idea is found in the remark near the end

Cf. also note.

* This is the account of Diodorus, who says he was taken prisoner
and crucified by the queen of the "Scythians" (3.11, ed. 1531, f.
80"). Herodotus says that he was slain in battle, but his head cut
off afterwards and dipped in a sack of blood by the queen Tomyris,
who had rejected his suit, the death of whose son he had caused,

Again, the sons of Greece celebrate Alexander
the Macedonian as the conqueror of many and
diverse nations; yet we find that he was re
moved by an early death, before he had reached
maturity, being carried off by the effects of
revelry and drunkenness."
His whole life em
braced but the space of thirty-two years, and
his reign extended to no more than a third part
of that period.
Unsparing as the thunderbolt,
he advanced through streams of blood and re
duced entire nations and cities, young and old,

But when he had scarcely

such deeds as these."

CHAPTER VIII.

That he conquered nearly the Whole World.

BUT our emperor began his reign at the time
of life at which the Macedonian died, yet doubled
the length of his life, and trebled the length of
his reign. And instructing his army in the mild
and sober precepts of godliness, he carried his
arms as far as the Britons, and the nations that
dwell in the very bosom of the Western ocean.
He subdued likewise all Scythia, though situated
in the remotest North, and divided into num
berless diverse and barbarous tribes. He even
pushed his conquests to the Blemmyans and
Ethiopians, on the very confines of the South ;
nor did he think the acquisition of the Eastern
nations unworthy his care.
In short, diffusing
the effulgence of his holy light to the ends of
the whole world, even to the most distant Indians,
the nations dwelling on the extreme circumfer
ence of the inhabited earth, he received the sub
mission of all the rulers," governors," and satraps
of barbarous nations, who cheerfully welcomed
and saluted him, sending embassies and presents,
and setting the highest value on his acquaintance
and friendship; insomuch that they honored
him with pictures and statues in their respec

royal edicts with all boldness.

CHAPTER IX.

That he was the Son of a Pious Emperor, and
/equeathed the Power to Aoya/Sons.

Nor did he give this testimony in words
merely, while exhibiting failure in his own prac
tice, but pursued every path of virtue, and was
rich in the varied fruits of godliness. He en
sured the affection of his friends by magnificent
proofs of liberality; and inasmuch as he gov
erned on principles of humanity, he caused his
rule to be but lightly felt and acceptable to all
classes of his subjects; until at last, after a long
course of years, and when he was wearied by
his divine labors, the God whom he honored
crowned him with an immortal reward, and
translated him from a transitory kingdom to
that endless life which he has laid up in store
for the souls of his saints, after he had raised
him up three sons to succeed him in his power.
As then the imperial throne had descended to
him from his father, so, by the law of nature, was
it reserved for his children and their descend
ants, and perpetuated, like some paternal inheri
tance, to endless generations. And indeed God
himself, who distinguished this blessed prince
with divine honors while yet present with us,
and who has adorned his death with choice
blessings from his own hand, should be the
writer of his actions; since he has recorded his
labors and successes on heavenly monuments."

CHAPTER X.

Of the AWeed for this //istory, and its Palue for
Aodification.

However, hard as it is to speak worthily of this
blessed character, and though silence were the
safer and less perilous course, nevertheless it is
incumbent on me, if I would escape the charge
of negligence and sloth, to trace as it were a
verbal portraiture, by way of memorial of the
pious prince, in imitation of the delineations of
human art.
For I should be ashamed of my
self were I not to employ my best efforts, feeble
though they be and of little value, in praise of
one who honored God with such surpassing de

since it will contain a description of those royal
and noble actions which are pleasing to God,
For would it not be dis

1 "The pillars of heaven." - Molz (?).

graceful that the memory of Nero, and other
impious and godless tyrants far worse than he,
should meet with diligent writers to embellish
the relation of their worthless deeds with elegant
language, and record them in voluminous his
tories, and that I should be silent, to whom God
himself has vouchsafed such an emperor as all
history records not, and has permitted me to
come into his presence, and enjoy his acquaint
ance and society?"

Wherefore, if it is the duty of any one, it cer
tainly is mine, to make an ample proclamation
of his virtues to all in whom the example of
noble actions is capable of inspiring the love of
God.
For some who have written the lives
of worthless characters, and the history of ac
tions but little tending to the improvement of
morals, from private motives, either love or en
mity, and possibly in some cases with no better
object than the display of their own learning,
have exaggerated unduly their description of
actions intrinsically base, by a refinement and
elegance of diction." And thus they have be
come to those who by the Divine favor had
been kept apart from evil, teachers not of good,
but of what should be silenced in oblivion and
darkness.
But my narrative, however unequal
to the greatness of the deeds it has to describe,
will yet derive luster even from the bare relation
of noble actions. And surely the record of con
duct that has been pleasing to God will afford
a far from unprofitable, indeed a most instruc
tive study, to persons of well-disposed minds.

CHAPTER XI.

That his Present Object is to record only the
Pous Actions of Constantine.

It is my intention, therefore, to pass over the
greater part of the royal deeds of this thrice
blessed prince ; as, for example, his conflicts
and engagements in the field, his personal valor.
his victories and successes against the enemy,
and the many triumphs he obtained : likewise
his provisions for the interests of individuals,
his legislative enactments for the social advan
tage of his subjects, and a multitude of other
imperial labors which are fresh in the memory
of all; the design of my present undertaking
being to speak and write of those circumstances
only which have reference to his religious char
acter.

And since these are themselves of almost

which have come to my knowledge such as are
most suitable, and worthy of lasting record, and
endeavor to narrate them as briefly as possible.
Henceforward, indeed, there is a full and free
opportunity for celebrating in every way the
praises of this truly blessed prince, which hith
erto we have been unable to do, on the ground
that we are forbidden to judge any one blessed
before his death," because of the uncertain vicis
situdes of life.
Let me implore then the help
of God, and may the inspiring aid of the heav
enly Word be with me, while I commence my
history from the very earliest period of his life.

CHAPTER XII.

Zhao Zike Moses, he was reared in the Palaces
of Kings.

ANCIENT history relates that a cruel race of
tyrants oppressed the Hebrew nation; and that
God, who graciously regarded them in their
affliction, provided that the prophet Moses, who
was then an infant, should be brought up in
the very palaces and bosoms of the oppressors,
and instructed in all the wisdom they possessed.
And when in the course of time he had arrived
at manhood, and the time was come for Divine
justice to avenge the wrongs of the afflicted
people, then the prophet of God, in obedience
to the will of a more powerful Lord, forsook
the royal household, and, estranging himself in
word and deed from the tyrants by whom he
had been brought up, openly acknowledging his
true brethren and kinsfolk. Then God, exalting
him to be the leader of the whole nation, de
livered the Hebrews from the bondage of their
enemies, and inflicted Divine vengeance through
his means on the tyrant race.
This ancient
story, though rejected by most as fabulous, has
reached the ears of all.
But now the same
God has given to us to be eye-witnesses of
miracles more wonderful than fables, and, from
their recent appearance, more authentic than
any report.
For the tyrants of our day have
ventured to war against the Supreme God, and
have sorely afflicted His Church.' And in the
midst of these, Constantine, who was shortly
to become their destroyer, but at that time of
tender age, and blooming with the down of early
youth, dwelt, as that other servant of God had
done, in the very home of the tyrants," but
young as he was did not share the manner of

life of the ungodly : for from that early period
his noble nature, under the leading of the Divine
Spirit, inclined him to piety and a life accept
able to God. A desire, moreover, to emulate
the example of his father had its influence in
stimulating the son to a virtuous course of con
duct.
His father was Constantius" (and we
ought to revive his memory at this time), the
most illustrious emperor of our age ; of whose life
it is necessary briefly to relate a few particulars,
which tell to the honor of his son.

CHAPTER XIII.

Of Constantius his Father, who refused

to
imitate Dioc/etian, Maximian, and Maven
fius," in their Persecution of the Christians.

At a time when four emperors" shared the
administration of the Roman empire, Constan
tius alone, following a course of conduct differ
ent from that pursued by his colleagues, entered
into the friendship of the Supreme God.

For while

they besieged and wasted

the
churches of God, leveling them to the ground,
and obliterating the very foundations of the
houses of prayer," he kept his hands pure from
their abominable impiety, and never in any
respect resembled them. They polluted their
provinces by the indiscriminate slaughter of
godly men and women; but he kept his soul
They, in
free from the stain of this crime."
volved in the mazes of impious idolatry, en
thralled first themselves, and then all under
their authority, in bondage to the errors of evil
demons, while he at the same time originated the
profoundest peace throughout his dominions,
and secured to his subjects the privilege of cele
brating without hindrance the worship of God.
In short, while his colleagues oppressed all men
by the most grievous exactions, and rendered
their lives intolerable, and even worse
than
death, Constantius alone governed his people
with a mild and tranquil sway, and exhibited
towards them a truly parental and fostering care.
Numberless, indeed, are the other virtues of
this man, which are the theme of praise to all;
of these I will record one or two instances, as
specimens of the quality of those which I must
pass by in silence, and then I will proceed to
the appointed order of my narrative.

CHAPTER XIV.

CHAPTER xv.

Asow Constantius his Father, being reproached'
with Poverty by Diocletian, filled his Treasury,
and afterward's restored the Money to those
Ay whom it had been contributed.

IN consequence of the many reports in cir
culation respecting this prince, describing his
kindness and gentleness of character, and the
extraordinary elevation of his piety, alleging
too, that by reason of his extreme indulgence
to his subjects, he had not even a supply of
money laid up in his treasury; the emperor
who at that time occupied the place of supreme
power sent to reprehend his neglect of the pub
lic weal, at the same time reproaching him with
poverty, and alleging in proof of the charge
the empty state of his treasury. On this he
desired the messengers of the emperor to re
main with him awhile, and, calling together the
wealthiest of his subjects of all nations under
his dominion, he informed them that he was in
want of money, and that this was the time for
them all to give a voluntary proof of their affec
tion for their prince.

As soon as they heard this (as though they
had long been desirous of an opportunity for
showing the sincerity of their good will), with
zealous alacrity they filled the treasury with gold
and silver and other wealth ; each eager to sur
pass the rest in the amount of his contribution:
and this they did with cheerful and joyous coun
tenances.
And now Constantius desired the
messengers of the great emperor' personally to
inspect his treasures, and directed them to give
a faithful report of what they had seen; adding,
that on the present occasion he had taken this
money into his own hands, but that it had long
been kept for his use in the custody of the
owners, as securely as if under the charge of
faithful treasurers. The ambassadors were over
whelmed with astonishment at what they had
witnessed : and on their departure it is said that
the truly generous prince sent for the owners of
the property, and, after commending them sev
erally for their obedience and true
loyalty,
restored it
all, and bade them return to their
homes.

This one circumstance, then, conveys a proof
of the generosity of him whose character we are
attempting to illustrate : another will contain the
clearest testimony to his piety.

* Or the senior Augustus. "Diocletian is thus entitled in the

ancient panegyrists and in inscriptions."- Heinrichen.

It was "towards the end of the second century of the Christian
era" that there began to be a plurality of A rogusłr, but "from this
time we find two or even a greater number of Augusti, and though
in that and in all similar cases the persons honored with the title
were regarded as participators of the imperial power, still the one
who received the title #. was looked upon as the head of the
empire." - Smith, Dict. Gr. and Rom. A rif.

Of the Persecution raised by his Colleagues.

By command of the supreme authorities of
the empire, the governors of the several prov
inces had set on foot a general persecution of
the godly.
Indeed, it was from the imperial
courts themselves that the very first of the pious
martyrs proceeded, who passed through those
conflicts for the faith, and most readily endured
both fire and sword, and the depths of the sea;
every form of death, in short, so that in a brief
time all the royal palaces were bereft of pious
men.' The result was, that the authors of this
wickedness were entirely deprived of the pro
tecting care of God, since by their persecution
of his worshipers they at the same time silenced
the prayers that were wont to be made on their
own behalf.

CHAPTER XVI.

How Constantius, feigning

Idolatry, expelled
those who consented so offer Sacrifice, but re
fained in his Palace all who were willing to
consess Christ.

ON the other hand, Constantius conceived an
expedient full of sagacity, and did a thing which
Sounds paradoxical, but in fact was most admi
rable.

He made a proposal to all the officers of his
court, including even those in the highest sta
tions of authority, offering them the following
alternative : either that they should offer sacri
fice to demons, and thus be permitted to remain
with him, and enjoy their usual honors ; or, in
case of refusal, that they should be shut out from
all access to his person, and entirely disqualified
from acquaintance and association with him.
Accordingly, when they had individually made
their choice, some one way and some the other,
and the choice of each had been ascertained,
then this admirable prince disclosed the secret
meaning of his expedient, and condemned the
cowardice and selfishness of the one party, while
he highly commended the other for their con
scientious devotion to God. He declared, too,
that those who had been false to their God must
be unworthy of the confidence of their prince ;
for how was it possible that they should preserve
their fidelity to him, who had proved themselves
faithless to a higher power? He determined,
therefore, that such persons should be removed
altogether from the imperial court, while, on the
other hand, declaring that those men who, in
bearing witness for the truth, had proved them

selves to be worthy servants of God, would
manifest the same fidelity to their king, he en
trusted them with the guardianship of his person
and empire, saying that he was bound to treat
such persons with special regard as his nearest
and most valued friends, and to esteem them
far more highly than the richest treasures.

CHAPTER XVII.

Of his Christian Manner of Zife.

THE father of Constantine, then, is said to
have possessed such a character as we have
briefly described. And what kind of death was
vouchsafed to him in consequence of such devo
tion to God, and how far he whom he honored
made his lot to differ from that of his colleagues
in the empire, may be known to any one who
will give his attention to the circumstances of
the case.
For after he had for a long time
given many proofs of royal virtue, in acknowl
edging the Supreme God alone, and condemning
the polytheism of the ungodly, and had fortified
his household by the prayers of holy men," he
passed the remainder of his life in remarkable
repose and tranquillity, in the enjoyment of
what is counted blessedness, - neither molest
ing others nor being molested ourselves.

Accordingly, during the whole course of his
quiet and peaceful reign, he dedicated his entire
household, his children, his wife, and domestic
attendants, to the One Supreme God: so that
the company assembled within the walls of his
palace differed in no respect from a church of
God ; wherein were also to be found his min
isters, who offered continual supplications on
behalf of their prince, and this at a time when,
with most," it was not allowable to have any
dealings with the worshipers of God, even so
far as to exchange a word with them.

CHAPTER XVIII.

That after the Abdication of Diocletian and
Maximian, Constantius became Chief All
gustus, and was blessed with a Mumerous
Offspring.

THE immediate consequence of this conduct
was a recompense from the hand of God, inso
much that he came into the supreme authority
of the empire.
For the older emperors, for
some unknown reason, resigned their power;

." "Is said to have " is added conjecturally here by an earlier
editor, but Heinichen omits, as it would seem Eusebius himself did.
*. Other readings are "with the others," or "with the rest," but

in whatever reading it refers to all the other emperors.

and this sudden change took place in the first
year after their persecution of the churches."

From that time Constantius alone received
the honors of chief Augustus, having been pre
viously, indeed, distinguished by the diadem of
the imperial Caesars," among whom he held the
first rank; but after his worth had been proved
in this capacity, he was invested with the high
est dignity of the Roman empire, being named
chief Augustus of the four who were afterwards
elected to that honor.
Moreover, he surpassed
most of the emperors in regard to the number
of his family, having gathered around him a very
large circle of children both male and female.
And, lastly, when he had attained to a happy
old age, and was about to pay the common debt
of nature, and exchange this life for another,
God once more manifested His power in a
special manner on his behalf, by providing that
his eldest son Constantine should be present
during his last moments, and ready to receive
the imperial power from his hands."

CHAPTER XIX.

Of his Son Constantine, who in his Youth ac
companied Diocletian into Palestine.

THE latter had been with his father's imperial
colleagues," and had passed his life among them,
as we have said, like God's ancient prophet.
And even in the very earliest period of his youth
he was judged by them to be worthy of the
highest honor. An instance of this we have
ourselves seen, when he passed through Pales
tine with the senior emperor," at whose right
hand he stood, and commanded the admiration
of all who beheld him by the indications he
gave even then of royal greatness.
For no one
was comparable to him for grace and beauty of
person, or height of stature ; and he so far sur
passed his compeers in personal strength as to
be a terror to them. He was, however, even
more conspicuous for the excellence of his men
tal" qualities than for
physical
endowments; being gifted in the first place
with a sound judgment," and having also reaped

CHAPTER XX.

Flight of Constantine to his Father because of
the Plots of Diocletian."

THE emperors then in power, observing his
manly and vigorous figure and superior mind,
were moved with feelings of jealousy and fear,
and thenceforward carefully watched for an
opportunity of inflicting some brand of disgrace
on his character.
But the young man, being
aware of their designs, the details of which,
through the providence of God, more than once
came to him, sought safety in flight; * in this
respect again keeping up his resemblance to the
great prophet Moses.
Indeed, in every sense
God was his helper; and he had before or
dained that he should be present in readiness
to succeed his father.

CHAPTER XXI.

Death of Constantius, who /eaves his Son Con
stantine Emperor."

IMMEDIATELY, therefore, on his escape from
the plots which had been thus insidiously laid
for him, he made his way with all haste to his
father, and arrived at length at the very time
that he was lying at the point of death."
As
soon as Constantius saw his son thus unex
pectedly in his presence, he leaped from his
couch, embraced him tenderly, and, declaring
that the only anxiety which had troubled him in
the prospect of death, namely, that caused by
the absence of his son, was now removed, he
rendered thanks to God, saying that he now
thought death better than the longest life," and
at once completed the arrangement of his private
affairs.
Then, taking a final leave of the circle
of sons and daughters by whom he was sur
rounded, in his own palace, and on the imperial
couch, he bequeathed the empire, according to
the law of nature," to his eldest son, and breathed
his last.

he was sick in bed, i.e. at York in Britain; but other accounts make
it probable that he joined him at Boulogne before he sailed on this
last expedition to Boi. Compare Prolegomena.

CHAPTER XXII.

How, after the Burial of Constantius, Constan
time was proclaimed Augustus by the Army.

Nor did the imperial throne remain long un
occupied : for Constantine invested himself with
his father's purple, and proceeded from his
father's palace, presenting to all a renewal, as
it were, in his own person, of his father's life
and reign. He then conducted the funeral pro
cession in company with his father's friends,
some preceding, others following the train, and
performed the last offices for the pious deceased
with an extraordinary degree of magnificence, and
all united in honoring this thrice blessed prince
with acclamations and praises, and while with one
mind and voice, they glorified the rule of the son
as a living again of him who was dead, they has
tened at once to hail their new sovereign by the
titles of Imperial and Worshipful Augustus, with
joyful shouts." Thus the memory of the deceased
emperor received honor from the praises be
stowed upon his son, while the latter was pro
nounced blessed in being the successor of such

ness at not being even for a moment deprived
of the benefits of a well ordered government.

In the instance of the Emperor Constantius,
God has made manifest to our generation what
the end of those is who in
their lives have
honored and loved him.

CHAPTER XXIII.

A Brief Motice of the Destruction of the Zyrants.

WITH respect to the other princes, who made
war against the churches of God, I have not
thought it fit in the present work to give any
account of their
downfall,' nor to stain the
memory of the good by mentioning them in
connection with those of an opposite character.
The knowledge of the facts themselves will of
itself suffice for the wholesome admonition of
those who have witnessed or heard of the evils
which severally befell them.

Zao of Nations, Phila., 1867, p. 24, 25). That primogeniture is a nat
ural law has been often urged, but it seems to be simply the law of first
come first served. The English custom of primogeniture is said to
have risen from the fact that in feudal times the eldest son was the
one who, at the time of the father's death, was of an age to meet
the duties of feudal tenure (compare Kent, Commentaries, Boston,
1867, v.4, p. 420, 421). This is precisely the fact respecting Con

THE LIFE OF CONSTANTINE.

CHAPTER XXIV.

It was by the Will of God that Constantine
became possessed of the Empire.

THUS then the God of all, the Supreme Gov
ernor of the whole universe, by his own will
appointed Constantine, the descendant of so
renowned a parent, to be prince and sovereign :
so that, while others have been raised to this
distinction by the election of their fellow-men,
he is the only one to whose elevation no mortal
may boast of having contributed.

CHAPTER XXV.

Victories of Constantime over the Barbarians
and the Britons.

As soon then as he was established on the
throne, he began to care for the interests of his
paternal inheritance, and visited with much con
siderate kindness all those provinces which had
previously been under his father's government.
Some tribes of the barbarians who dwelt on the
banks of the Rhine, and the shores of the West
ern ocean, having ventured to revolt, he reduced
them all to obedience, and brought them from
their savage state to one of gentleness. He
contented himself with checking the inroads of
others, and drove from his dominions, like un
tamed and savage beasts, those whom he per
ceived to be altogether incapable of the settled
order of civilized life."
Having disposed of
these affairs to his satisfaction, he directed his
attention to other quarters of the world, and
first passed over to the British nations," which

reduced to submission, and then proceeded to
consider the state of the remaining portions of
the empire, that he might be ready to tender
his aid wherever circumstances might require it.

CHAPTER XXVI.

How he reso/ved to deliver Rome from
A/axentius.

While, therefore, he regarded the entire world
as one immense body, and perceived that the
head of it all, the royal city of the Roman
empire, was bowed down by the weight of a
tyrannous oppression; at first he had left the

attempted it had experienced a disastrous ter

was without enjoyment to him as long as he saw
the imperial city thus afflicted, and prepared
himself for the overthrowal of the tyranny.

CHAPTER XXVII.

That after reflecting on the Downfal/ of those
who had worshiped salols, he made Choice of
Christianity.

BEING convinced, however, that he needed
some more powerful aid than his military forces
could afford him, on account of the wicked and
magical enchantments which were so diligently
practiced by the tyrant," he sought Divine assist
ance, deeming the possession of arms and a
numerous soldiery of secondary importance, but
believing the co-operating power of Deity invin
cible and not to be shaken. He considered,
therefore, on what God he might rely for pro
tection and assistance.
While engaged in this
enquiry, the thought occurred to him, that, of
the many emperors who had preceded him,
those who had rested their hopes in a multitude
of gods, and served them with sacrifices and
offerings, had in the first place been deceived
predictions, and oracles which
by flattering
promised them all prosperity, and at last had
met with an unhappy end, while not one of their
gods had stood by to warn them of the impend
ing wrath of heaven; while one alone who had
pursued an entirely opposite course, who had
condemned their error, and honored the one
Supreme God during his whole life, had found
him to be the Saviour and Protector of his em
pire, and the Giver of every good thing. Re
flecting on this, and well weighing the fact that
they who had trusted in many gods had also
fallen by manifold
forms of death, without
leaving behind them either family or offspring,
stock, name, or memorial among men : while
the God of his father had given to him, on the
other hand, manifestations of his power and
very many tokens : and considering farther that
those who had already taken arms against the
tyrant, and had marched to the battle-field under
the protection of a multitude of gods, had met
with a dishonorable end (for one of them " had
shamefully retreated from the contest without a
blow, and the other," being slain in the midst of

considerations, he judged it to be folly indeed
to join in the idle worship of those who were no
gods, and, after such convincing evidence, to
err from the truth ; and therefore felt it incum
bent on him to honor his father's God alone.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

How, while he was praying, God sent him a
Vision of a Cross of Light in the Heavens at
Mid-day, with an Inscription admonishing him
to conquer by that.

Accordingly he called on him with earnest
prayer and supplications that he would reveal
to him who he was, and stretch forth his right
hand to help him in his present difficulties.
And while he was thus praying with fervent en
treaty, a most marvelous sign appeared to him
from heaven, the account of which it might have
been hard to believe had it been related by any
other person.
But since the victorious emperor
himself long afterwards declared it to the writer
of this history," when he was honored with his
acquaintance and society, and confirmed his
statement by an oath, who could hesitate to
accredit the relation, especially since the testi
mony of after-time has established its truth?
He said that about noon, when the day was
already beginning to decline, he saw with his
own eyes the trophy of a cross of light in the
heavens, above the sun, and bearing the inscrip
tion, CONQUER BY THIS.
At this sight he himself
was struck with amazement, and his whole army
also, which followed him on this expedition, and
witnessed the miracle."

* This last phrase has exercised, the ingenuity of translators
greatly. This translation does well, enough, though one might
§o " was easily overcome by death," or "was an easy victim
to death."

* Note here the care Eusebius takes to throw off the responsi
bility for the marvelous.
It at the same time goes to show the gen
eral credibility of Eusebius, and some doubt in his mind of the exact
nature and reality of what he records.

* This very circumstantial account has met with doubters from
the very beginning, commencing with Eusebius himself.

with the erection of the arch, and alluded to in general, but hardly
to be doubted, terms by Nazarius in 321.
Moreover, it is witnessed
to by the fact of the standard of the cross which was made. As to
the real nature of the manifestation, it has been thought to be as
recorded by Constantine, and if so, as perhaps some natural phe
nomenon of the sun; or to have been a simple dream, or an hallu
cination.
It is hardly profitable to discuss the possibilities. The
lack of contemporary evidence to details and the description of Lac
tantius as a dream is fatal to any idea of a miraculous image with
inscriptions clearly seen by all.
Some cross-like arrangement of
the clouds, or a "parahelion," or some sort of a suggestion of a
cross, may have been seen by all, but evidently there was no definite,
vivid, clear perception, or it would have becn in the mouths of all,
and certainly recorded, or at least it would not have been recorded
as something else by Lactantius.
It seems probable that the em
peror, thinking intensely, with all the weight of his great problem
resting on his energetic mind, wondering if the Christian God was
perhaps the God who could help, saw in some suggestive shape of

CHAPTER XXIX.

Asow the Christ of God appeared to him in his
Sleep, and commanded him to use in his Wars
a Standard made in the Form of the Cross.

HE said, moreover, that he doubted within
himself what the import of this apparition could
be.
And while he continued to ponder and
reason on its meaning, night suddenly came on ;
then in his sleep the Christ of God appeared to
him with the same sign which he had seen in
the heavens, and commanded him to make a
likeness of that sign which he had seen in the
heavens, and to use it as a safeguard in all en
gagements with his enemies.

CHAPTER XXX.

The Making of the Standard of the Cross.

At dawn of day he arose, and communicated
the marvel to his friends: and then, calling to
gether the workers in gold and precious stones,
he sat in the midst of them, and described to
them the figure of the sign he had seen, bidding
them represent it in gold and precious stones.
And this representation I myself have had an
opportunity of seeing.

which the A'omans now call the Zaharum.'

Now it was made in the following manner.
A long spear, overlaid with gold, formed the

the clouds or of sunlight the form of a cross, and there flashed out
in his mind in intensest reality the vision of the words, so that for
the moment he was living in the intensest reality of such a vision.
His mind had just that intense activity to which such a thing is
possible or actual.
It is like Goethe's famous meeting of his own
self.
It is that genius power for the realistic representation of ideal
things. This is not the same exactly as "hallucination," or even
"imagination.". The hallucination probably came later when Con
stantine gradually represented to himself and finally to Eusebius the
vivid idea with its slight ground, as an objective reality, - a common
phenomenon. . When the emperor went to sleep, his brain molecules
vibrating to the forms of his late intense thought, he inevitably
dreamcd, and dreaming naturally confirmed his thought. This does
not say that the suggestive form secn, or the idea itself, and the
direction of the dream itself, were not providential and the work of
the Holy Spirit, for they were, and were special in character, and
so miraculous (or why do ideas come?); but it is to be feared that
Constantine's own spirit or something else furnished some of the
later details. There is a slight difference of authority as to when
and where the vision took place. The panegyrist seems to make it
before leaving Gaul, and Malalas is inaccurate as usual in having
it happen in a war against the barbarians.

the sign which had appeared was the symbol of
immortality,' and the trophy of that victory over
death which He had gained in time past when
sojourning on earth.
They taught him also the
causes of His advent, and explained to him the
true account of His incarnation. Thus he was
instructed in these matters, and was impressed
with wonder at the divine manifestation which
had been presented to his sight.
Comparing,
therefore, the heavenly vision with the interpre
tation given, he found his judgment confirmed;
and, in the persuasion that the knowledge of
these things had been imparted to him by
Divine teaching, he determined thenceforth to
devote himself to the reading of the Inspired
writings.

Moreover, he made the priests of God his
counselors, and deemed it incumbent on him
to honor the God who had appeared to him

Of the Adulterous Conduct of Maxentius at
Atome."

For he who had tyrannically possessed him
self of the imperial city," had proceeded to
great lengths in impiety and wickedness, so as
to venture without hesitation on every vile and
impure action.

For example: he would separate women from
their husbands, and after a time send them back
to them again, and these insults he offered not
to men of mean or obscure condition, but to
those who held the first places in the Roman
senate.
Moreover, though he shamefully dis
honored almost numberless free women, he was
unable to satisfy his ungoverned and intemperate
desires. But" when he assayed to corrupt Chris
tian women also, he could no longer secure
success to his designs, since they chose rather
to submit their lives "to death than yield their
persons to be defiled by him.

Nay, though
they submitted quietly, and endured this bitter
servitude, still there was no escape from the
tyrant's sanguinary cruelty.
For at one time,
on some trifling pretense, he exposed the popu
lace to be slaughtered by his own body-guard;
and countless multitudes of the Roman people
were slain in the very midst of the city by the
lances and weapons, not of Scythians or bar
barians, but of their own fellow-citizens. And

number of senators whose blood was shed with

THE LIFE OF CONSTANTINE.

Holy Writ, which God of old wrought against
the ungodly (discredited by most as fables, yet
believed by the faithful), did he in every deed
confirm to all alike, believers and unbelievers,
who were eye-witnesses of the wonders.
For as
once in the days of Moses and the Hebrew na
tion, who were worshipers of God, "Pharaoh's
chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea,
and his chosen chariot-captains are drowned in
the Red Sea,"-so at this time Maxentius, and
the soldiers and guards "with him, "went down
into the depths like stone," when, in his flight
before the divinely-aided forces of Constantine,
he essayed to cross the river which lay in his
way, over which, making a strong bridge of
boats, he had framed an engine of destruction,
really against himself, but in the hope of en
snaring thereby him who was beloved by God.
For his God stood by the one to protect him,
while
the other, godless," proved to be the
miserable contriver of these secret devices to
his own ruin.
So that one might well say, "He
hath made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into
the ditch which he made.
His mischief shall
return upon his own head, and his violence shall
come down upon his own pate.""
Thus, in the
present instance, under divine direction, the
machine erected on the bridge, with the ambus
cade concealed therein, giving way unexpectedly
before the appointed time, the bridge began to
sink, and the boats with the men in them went
bodily to the bottom." And first the wretch
himself, then his armed attendants and guards,
even as the sacred oracles had before described,
"sank as lead in the mighty waters." So that
they who thus obtained victory from God might
well, if not in the same words, yet in fact in the
same spirit as the people of his great servant
Moses, sing and speak as they did concerning
the impious tyrant of old : "Let us sing unto the
Lord, for he hath been glorified exceedingly :

Of the Statue of Constantine hosting a Cross,
and its /nscription.

MoREover, by loud proclamation and monu
mental inscriptions he made known to all men
the salutary symbol, setting up this great trophy
of victory over his enemies in the midst of the
imperial city, and expressly causing it to be
engraven in indelible characters, that the salu
tary symbol was the safeguard of the Roman
government and of the entire empire. Accord
ingly, he immediately ordered a lofty spear in
the figure of a cross to be placed beneath the
hand of a statue representing himself, in the
most frequented part of Rome, and the follow
ing inscription to be engraved on it in the Latin
language :
BY VIRTUE OF THIS SALUTARY SIGN,
WHICH IS THE TRUE TEST OF VALOR, I HAVE

CHAPTER XLIII.

A'ejoicings throughout the Provinces; and Com
stantine's Acts of Grace.

THUS the pious emperor, glorying in the con
fession of the victorious cross, proclaimed the
Son of God to the Romans with great boldness
of testimony. And the inhabitants of the city,
one and all, senate and people, reviving, as it
were, from the pressure of a bitter and tyran
nical domination, seemed to enjoy purer rays
of light, and to be born again into a fresh and
new life.
All the nations, too, as far as the
limit of the western ocean, being set free from
the calamities which had heretofore beset them,
and gladdened by joyous festivals, ceased not to
praise him as the victorious, the pious, the com
mon benefactor: all, indeed, with one voice and
one mouth, declared that Constantine had ap
peared by the grace of God as a general blessing
to mankind. The imperial edict also was every
where published, whereby those who had been
wrongfully deprived of their estates were per
mitted again to enjoy their own, while those who
had unjustly suffered exile were recalled to their
homes.
Moreover, he freed from imprisonment,
and from every kind of danger and fear, those
who, by reason of the tyrant's cruelty, had been
subject to these sufferings.

CHAPTER XLII.

The Honors conferred upon Bishops, and she
Building of Churches.

THE emperor also personally inviting the so
ciety of God's ministers, distinguished them ||
with the highest possible respect and honor,
showing them favor in deed and word as persons
consecrated to the service of his God. Accord
ingly, they were admitted to his table, though
mean in their attire and outward appearance;
yet not so in his estimation, since he thought he
saw not the man as seen by the vulgar eye, but
the God in him. He made them also his com
panions in travel, believing that He whose ser
vants they were would thus help him.
Besides
this, he gave from his own private resources
costly benefactions to the churches of God, both
enlarging and heightening the sacred edifices,'
and embellishing the august sanctuaries" of the
church with abundant offerings.

Constantine's Liberality to the Poor.

HE likewise distributed money largely to those
who were in need, and besides these showing
himself philanthropist and benefactor even to
the heathen, who had no claim on him ; " and
even for the beggars in the forum, miserable
and shiftless, he provided, not with money only,
or necessary food, but also decent clothing.
But in the case of those who had once been
prosperous, and had experienced a reverse of
circumstances, his aid was still more lavishly
bestowed. On such persons, in a truly royal
spirit, he conferred magnificent benefactions;
giving grants of land to some, and honoring
Orphans of the
others with various dignities.
unfortunate he cared for as a father, while he
relieved the destitution of widows, and cared
for them with special solicitude.
Nay, he even
gave virgins, left unprotected by their parents'
death, in marriage to wealthy men with whom
he was personally acquainted.
But this he did
after first bestowing on the brides such portions
as it was fitting they should bring to the com
munion of marriage."
In short, as the sun, when
he rises upon the earth, liberally imparts his
rays of light to all, so did Constantine, proceed
ing at early dawn from the imperial palace, and
rising as it were with the heavenly luminary,
impart the rays of his own beneficence to all
who came into his presence.
It was scarcely
possible to be near him without receiving some
benefit, nor did it ever happen that any who
had expected to obtain his assistance were dis
appointed in their hope."

CHAPTER XLIV.

How he was present at the Synods of Bishops.

SUCH, then, was his general character towards
all.
But he exercised a peculiar care over the
church of God : and whereas, in the several
provinces there were some who differed from
each other in judgment, he, like some general
bishop constituted by God, convened synods of
his ministers.
Nor did he disdain to be present
and sit with them in their assembly, but bore a
share in their deliberations, ministering to all
that pertained to the peace of God. He took

his seat, too, in the midst of them, as an indi
vidual amongst many, dismissing his guards and
soldiers, and all whose duty it was to defend his
person; but protected by the fear of God, and
surrounded by the guardianship of his faithful
friends. Those whom he saw inclined to a sound
judgment, and exhibiting a calm and conciliatory
temper, received his high approbation, for he
evidently delighted in a general harmony of sen
timent; while he regarded the unyielding with
aversion."

CHAPTER XLV.

Asis Forbearance with Unreasonable Men.

MoREover he endured with patience some
who were exasperated against himself, directing
them in mild and gentle terms to control them
selves, and not be turbulent. And some of
these respected his admonitions, and desisted ;
but as to those who proved incapable of sound
judgment, he left them entirely at the disposal
of God, and never himself desired harsh meas
ures against any one.
Hence it naturally hap
pened that the disaffected in Africa reached such
a pitch of violence as even to venture on overt
acts of audacity;" some evil spirit, as it seems
probable, being jealous of the present great
prosperity, and impelling these men to atrocious
deeds, that he might excite the emperor's anger
against them. He gained nothing, however, by
this malicious conduct; for the emperor laughed
at these proceedings, and declared their origin
to be from the evil one ; inasmuch as these were
not the actions of sober persons, but of lunatics
or demoniacs; who should be pitied rather
than punished ; since to punish madmen is as
great folly as to sympathize with their condition
is supreme philanthropy."

After him others also of the same family

being miraculously revealed by God through

WHILE he was thus circumstanced, he com

festivals, and offered prayers of thanksgiving to
God, the King of all, as sacrifices without flame
or smoke.' And from this employment he de
rived much pleasure : not so from the tidings he
received of the ravages committed in the Eastern
provinces.

intended. To any one who compares the order of narration in the
Church //istory, 9.9, 11, the discussion will seem idle, though it

have been mistaken for one of the abdicators. . It seems as if there
had been some confusion in the mind of Eusebius himself.

CHAPTER XLIX.

How Zicinius oppressed the East.

For he was informed that in that quarter a
certain savage beast was besetting both the
church of God and the other inhabitants of the
provinces, owing, as it were, to the efforts of
the evil spirit to produce effects quite contrary
to the deeds of the pious emperor: so that the
Roman empire, divided into two parts, seemed
to all men to resemble night and day; since
darkness overspread the provinces of the East,
while the brightest day illumined the inhabitants
of the other portion.
And whereas the latter
were receiving manifold blessings at the hand
of God, the sight of these blessings proved in
tolerable to that envy which hates all good, as
well as to the tyrant who afflicted the other
division of the empire; and who, notwithstand
ing that his government was prospering, and he
had been honored by a marriage connection'
with so great an emperor as Constantine, yet
cared not to follow the steps of that pious prince,
but strove rather to imitate the evil purposes and
practice of the impious ; and chose to adopt
the course of those whose ignominious end he
had seen with his own eyes, rather than to main
tain amicable relations with him who was his
superior."

ACCORDINGLY he engaged in an implacable
war against his benefactor, altogether regardless
of the laws of friendship, the obligation of oaths,
the ties of kindred, and already existing treaties.
For the most benignant emperor had given him
a proof of sincere affection in bestowing on him
the hand of his sister, thus granting him the
privilege of a place in family relationship and
his own ancient imperial descent, and investing

in his first attempts, he had recourse to fresh
frauds; at one time pretending friendship, at
another claiming the protection of solemn trea
ties.
Then suddenly violating every engage
ment, and again beseeching pardon by embassies,
yet after all shamefully violating his word, he at
last declared open war, and with desperate in
fatuation resolved thenceforward to carry arms
against God himself, whose worshiper he knew
the emperor to be.

who had never, indeed, in any respect offended
against his government, in order to bring false
accusations against them. And when he found
no ground of accusation, and had no real ground
of objection against them, he next enacted a law,
to the effect that the bishops should never on
any account hold communication with each other,
nor should any one of them absent himself on a
visit to a neighboring church ; nor, lastly, should

displaying his malice against us.
For we were
compelled either to violate the law, and thus be
amenable to punishment, or else, by compliance
with its injunctions, to nullify the statutes of the
Church; inasmuch as it is impossible to bring
important questions to a satisfactory adjustment,
except by means of synods.
In other cases also
this God-hater, being determined to act contrary
to the God-loving prince, enacted such things.
For whereas the one assembled the priests of
God in order to honor them, and to promote
peace and unity of judgment; the other, whose
object it was to destroy everything that was
good, used all his endeavors to destroy the
general harmony.

Faict that Women should not meet with the

ACCORDINGLY he passed a second law, which

women to attend the sacred schools of virtue, or
to receive instruction from the bishops, direct

means for effecting the ruin of the churches.
He ordered that the usual congregations of the
people should be held in the open country out
side the gates, alleging that the open air without
the city was far more suitable for a multitude
than the houses of prayer within the walls.

CHAPTER LIV.

That those who refuse to sacrifice are to be dis
missed from Military Service, and those in
Prison not to be sed.

FAILING, however, to obtain obedience in this
respect also, at length he threw off the mask,
and gave orders that those who held military
commissions in the several cities of the empire
should be deprived of their respective com
mands, in case of their refusal to offer sacrifices

authorities in every province suffered the loss of
those who worshiped God; and he too who
had decreed this order suffered loss, in that he
thus deprived himself of the prayers of pious
men. And why should I still further mention
how he directed that no one should obey the
dictates of common humanity by distributing
food to those who were pining in prisons, or
should even pity the captives who perished with
hunger; in short, that no one should perform a
virtuous action, and that those whose natural

feelings impelled them to sympathize with their
fellow-creatures should be prohibited from doing
them a single kindness? Truly this was the most
utterly shameless and scandalous of all laws, and
one which surpassed the worst depravity of
human nature: a law which inflicted on those
who showed mercy the same penalties as on
those who were the objects of their compassion,
and visited the exercise of mere humanity with
the severest punishments."

CHAPTER LV.

The Lawless Conduct and Cowetousness of
Alicinius.

SUCH were the ordinances of Licinius.

But
why should I enumerate his innovations respect
ing marriage, or those concerning the dying,
whereby he presumed to abrogate the ancient
and wisely established laws of the Romans, and
to introduce certain barbarous and cruel institu
tions in their stead, inventing a thousand pre
tenses for oppressing his subjects? Hence it

But why should I
mention how many innocent persons he punished
with exile; how much property he confiscated ;
how many men of noble birth and estimable
character he imprisoned, whose wives he handed
over to be basely insulted by his profligate slaves,
and to how many married women and virgins he
himself offered violence, though already feeling

these subjects, since the enormity of his last

his open hostility to the churches, and he di
rected his attacks against the bishops themselves,

ing special enmity to those men whom the great
and pious emperor treated as his friends. Ac
cordingly he spent on us the utmost of his fury,
and, being transported beyond the bounds of
reason, he paused not to reflect on the example
of those who had persecuted the Christians
before him, nor of those whom he himself had
been raised up to punish and destroy for their
impious deeds: nor did he heed the facts of
which he had been himself a witness, though he
had seen with his own eyes the chief originator
of these our calamities (whoever he was), smit

against the Church; and, confessing his sins
before God, he put a stop to the persecution of
the Christians, and hastened to issue imperial

churches, at the same time enjoining them to
perform their customary worship, and to offer
up prayers on his behalf."

He,'
however, of whom we are now speaking, who had
been a witness of these things, and known them
by his own actual experience, all at once ban

and reflected neither on the punishment of the

executed on the second persecutor." The latter

addition to all these, he discovered a new mode

that their eyesight should be destroyed.
So
that numbers, not of men only, but of women
and children, after being deprived of the sight
of their eyes, and the use of the joints of their
feet, by mutilation or cauterization, were con
signed in this condition to the painful labor of
the mines.
Hence it was that this tyrant also
was overtaken not long after by the righteous
judgment of God, at a time when, confiding in
the aid of the demons whom he worshiped as
gods, and relying on the countless multitudes
of his troops, he had ventured to engage in

destitute of all hope in God, he threw from him
the imperial dress which so ill became him, hid
himself with unmanly timidity in the crowd
around him, and sought safety in flight."

He afterwards lurked about the fields and
villages in the habit of a slave, hoping he should
thus be effectually concealed.
He had not,
however, eluded the mighty and all-searching
eye of God: for even while he was expecting
to pass the residue of his days in security, he
fell prostrate, smitten by God's fiery dart, and
his whole body consumed by the stroke of
Divine vengeance; so that all trace of the orig
inal lineaments of his person was lost, and noth
ing remained to him but dry bones and a
skeleton-like appearance.

That Maximin, //inded by Disease, issued an

the very same punishment which he had been

the first to devise for the martyrs of God.
At
length, however, surviving even these sufferings,
he too implored pardon of the God of the Chris
tians, and confessed his impious fighting against
God: he too recanted, as the former persecutor
had done ; and by laws and ordinances explicitly
acknowledged his error in worshiping those
whom he had accounted gods, declaring that he

now knew, by positive experience, that the God
of the Christians was the only true God.
These
were facts which Licinius had not merely re
ceived on the testimony of others, but of which
he had himself had personal knowledge ; and
yet, as though his understanding had been ob
scured by some dark cloud of error, persisted
in the same evil course.

BOOK II.

CHAPTER I.

Secret Persecution by Licinius, who causes Some
Bishops to be put to Death at Amasia of
Aonfus.

IN this manner, he of whom we have spoken
continued to rush headlong towards that de
struction which awaits the enemies of God ; and
once more, with a fatal emulation of their ex
ample whose ruin he had himself witnessed as
the consequence of their impious conduct, he
re-kindled the persecution of the Christians,
like a long-extinguished fire, and fanned the
unhallowed flame to a fiercer height than any
who had gone before him.

At first, indeed, though breathing fury and
threatenings against God, like some savage beast
of prey, or some crooked and wriggling serpent,
he dared not, from fear of Constantine, openly
level his attacks against the churches of God
subject to his dominion; but dissembled the
virulence of his malice, and endeavored by
secret and limited measures to compass the
death of the bishops, the most eminent of whom
he found means to remove, through charges laid
against them by the governors of the several
provinces.
And the manner in which they
suffered had in it something strange, and hither
to unheard of.
At all events, the barbarities
perpetrated at Amasia of Pontus surpassed every
known excess of cruelty.

CHAPTER II.
Demolition of Churches, and Buschery of the
Bishops.

For in that city some of the churches, for the
second time since the commencement of the
persecutions, were leveled with the ground, and
others were closed by the governors of the sev
eral districts, in order to prevent any who fre
quented them from assembling together, or

whose orders these outrages were committed
was too conscious of his own crimes to expect
that these services were performed with any
view to his benefit, and was convinced that all
we did, and all our endeavors to obtain the
favor of God, were on Constantine's behalf.

These servile governors' then, feeling assured
that such a course would be pleasing to the
impious tyrant, subjected the most distinguished
prelates of the churches to capital punishment.
Accordingly, men who had been guilty of no
crime were led away, without cause" punished
like murderers : and some suffered a new kind
of death, having their bodies cut piecemeal;
and, after this cruel punishment, more horrible
than any named in tragedy, being cast, as a food
to fishes, into the depths of the sea. The result
of these horrors was again, as before, the flight
of pious men, and once more the fields and
deserts received the worshipers of God. The
tyrant, having thus far succeeded in his object,
he farther determined to raise a general perse
cution of the Christians : * and he would have
accomplished his purpose, nor could anything
have hindered him from carrying his resolution
into effect, had not he who defends his own an
ticipated the coming evil, and by his special
guidance conducted his servant Constantine to
this part of the empire, causing him to shine
forth as a brilliant light in the midst of the dark
ness and gloomy night.

CHAPTER III.

IIow, Constantine was stirred in Behalf of the
Christians thus in Danger of Persecution.

HE, perceiving the evils of which he had heard
to be no longer tolerable, took wise counsel, and
tempering the natural clemency of his character
with a certain measure of severity, hastened to
succor those who were thus grievously oppressed.
For he judged that it would rightly be deemed
a pious and holy task to secure, by the removal
of an individual, the safety of the greater part
of the human race. He judged too, that if he
listened to the dictates of clemency only, and
bestowed his pity on one utterly unworthy of it,
this would, on the one hand, confer no real
benefit on a man whom nothing would induce
to abandon his evil practices, and whose fury
against his subjects would only be likely to in

THE LIFE OF CONSTANTINE.

crease ;" while, on the other hand, those who
suffered from his oppression would thus be for
ever deprived of all hope of deliverance.

Influenced by these reflections, the emperor
resolved without farther delay to extend a pro
tecting hand to those who had fallen into such
an extremity of distress. He accordingly made
the usual warlike preparations, and assembled
his whole forces, both of horse and foot.
But
before them all was carried the standard which
I have before described, as the symbol of his full
confidence in God.

CHAPTER IV.

7%at Constantine prepared himself for the War
&y Prayer: Licinius by the Practice of Divi
nation.

HE took with him also the priests of God,
feeling well assured that now, if ever, he stood
in need of the efficacy of prayer, and thinking
it right that they should constantly be near and
about his person, as most trusty guardians of the
soul.

Now, as soon as the tyrant understood that
Constantine's victories over his enemies were
secured to him by no other means than the co
operation of God, and that the persons above
alluded to were continually with him and about
his person; and besides this, that the symbol of
the salutary passion preceded both the emperor
himself and his whole army; he regarded these
precautions with ridicule (as might be expected),
at the same time mocking and reviling the em
peror with blasphemous words.

On the other hand, he gathered round him
self Egyptian diviners and soothsayers, with sor
cerers and enchanters, and the priests and proph
ets of those whom he imagined to be gods. He
then, after offering the sacrifices which he thought
the occasion demanded, enquired how far he
might reckon on a successful termination of the
war. They replied with one voice, that he would
unquestionably be victorious over his enemies,
and triumphant in the war: and the oracles
everywhere held out to him the same prospect
in copious and elegant verses. The soothsayers
certified him of favorable omens from the flight
of birds; the priests' declared the same to be
indicated by the motion of the entrails of their
victims.
Elevated, therefore, by these fallacious
assurances, he boldly advanced at the head of
his army, and prepared for battle.

CHAPTER V.

What Licinius, while sacrificing in a Grove, said
concerning Idols, and concerning Christ.

AND when he was now ready to engage, he
desired the most approved of his body-guard'
and his most valued friends to meet him in one
of the places which they consider sacred.
It
was a well-watered and shady grove, and in it
were several marble statues of those whom he
accounted to be gods.
After lighting tapers
and performing the usual sacrifices in honor of
these, he is said to have delivered the following
speech:

"Friends and fellow-soldiers | These are our
country's gods, and these we honor with a wor
But
ship derived from our remotest ancestors.
he who leads the army now opposed to us has
proved false to the religion of his forefathers,
and adopted atheistic sentiments, honoring in
his infatuation some strange and unheard-of
Deity, with whose despicable standard he now
disgraces his army, and confiding in whose aid
he has taken up arms, and is now advancing, not
so much against us as against those very gods
whom he has forsaken.
However, the present
occasion shall prove which of us is mistaken in
his judgment, and shall decide between our gods
and those whom our adversaries profess to honor.
For either it will declare the victory to be ours,
and so most justly evince that our gods are the
true saviours and helpers; or else, if this God of
Constantine's, who comes we know not whence,
shall prove superior to our deities (who are many,
and in point of numbers, at least, have the advan
tage), let no one henceforth doubt which god
he ought to worship, but attach himself at once
to the superior power, and ascribe to him the
honors of the victory. Suppose, then, this strange
God, whom we now regard with ridicule, should
really prove victorious ; then indeed we must
acknowledge and give him honor, and so bid a
long farewell to those for whom we light our ta
pers in vain.
But if our own gods triumph (as
they undoubtedly will), then, as soon as we have
secured the present victory, let us prosecute the
war without delay against these despisers of the
gods."

Such were the words he addressed to those
then present, as reported not long after to the
writer of this history by some who heard them
spoken." And as soon as he had concluded his
speech, he gave orders to his forces to commence
the attack.

army seemed to present themselves to the view,
marching at noonday through these cities, as
though they had obtained the victory.
In real
ity, not a single soldier was anywhere present at
the time, and yet this appearance was seen
through the agency of a divine and superior
power, and foreshadowed what was shortly com
ing to pass.
For as soon as the armies were
ready to engage, he who had broken through
the ties of friendly alliance' was the first to
commence the battle ; on which Constantine,
calling on the name of "God the Supreme Sav
iour," and giving this as the watchword to his sol
diers, overcame him in this first conflict: and not
long after in a second battle he gained a still
more important and decisive victory, the salu
tary trophy preceding the ranks of his army.

CHAPTER VII.

That Victory everywhere fo//owed the Presence
of the Standard of the Cross in Battle.

INDEED, wherever this appeared, the enemy
soon fled before his victorious troops. And the
emperor perceiving this, whenever he saw any
part of his forces hard pressed, gave orders that
the salutary trophy should be moved in that
direction, like some triumphant charm' against
disasters: at which the combatants were divinely
inspired, as it were, with fresh strength and
courage, and immediate victory was the result.

the standard, which they carried each in turn
on their shoulders. These circumstances were
related to the writer of this narrative by the
emperor himself in his leisure moments, long
after the occurrence of the events: and he
added another incident well worthy of being
recorded.

CHAPTER IX.

That One of the Cross-bearers, who fled from
His Post, was slain : while Another, who faith
fully stood his Ground, was preserved.

For he said that once, during the very heat
of an engagement, a sudden tumult and panic
attacked his army, which threw the soldier who
then bore the standard into an agony of fear, so
that he handed it over to another, in order to
secure his own escape from the battle.
As
soon, however, as his comrade had received it,
and he had withdrawn, and resigned all charge
of the standard, he was struck in the belly by a
dart, which took his life. Thus he paid the
penalty of his cowardice and unfaithfulness, and
lay dead on the spot: but the other, who had
taken his place as the bearer of the salutary
standard, found it to be the safeguard of his
life.
For though he was assailed by a continual
shower of darts, the bearer remained unhurt,
the staff of the standard receiving every weapon.
It was indeed a truly marvelous circumstance,
that the enemies' darts all fell within and re
mained in the slender circumference of this
spear, and thus saved the standard-bearer from
death; so that none of those engaged in this
service ever received a wound.

This story is none of mine, but for this,' too,
I am indebted to the emperor's own authority,
who related it in my hearing along with other
matters.
And now, having thus through the
power of God secured these first victories, he
put his forces in motion and continued his
onward march.

CHAPTER VIII.

That Fifty Men were selected to carry the Cross.

AccordinGLy, he selected those of his body
guard who were most distinguished for personal
strength, valor, and piety, and intrusted them
with the sole care and defense of the standard.
There were thus no less than fifty men whose
only duty was to surround and vigilantly defend
tive imagination and memory, when relating after the cvents, that
the modern reader does.

overtures, but when these were not accepted he
ordered his army to commence the attack. On
this they immediately turned and betook them
selves to flight; and some were overtaken and
slain according to the laws of war, while others
fell on each other in the confusion of their flight,
and perished by the swords of their comrades.

CHAPTER XI.

Flight, and Magic Arts of Licinius.

IN these

circumstances

their commander,
finding himself bereft of the aid of his followers,'
having lost his lately numerous array, both of
regular and allied forces, having proved, too, by
experience, how vain his confidence had been
in those whom he thought to be gods, ignomini
ously took to flight, by which indeed he effected
his escape, and secured his personal safety, for the
pious emperor had forbidden his soldiers to fol
low him too closely," and thus allowed him an
opportunity for escape. And this he did in the
hope that he might hereafter, on conviction of
the desperate state of his affairs, be induced to
abandon his insane and presumptuous ambition,
and return to sounder reason.
So Constantine,
his excessive humanity, thought and was
in
willing patiently to bear past injuries, and ex
tend his forgiveness to one who so ill deserved
it; but Licinius, far from renouncing his evil
practices, still added crime to crime, and ven
tured on more daring atrocities than ever. Nay,
once more tampering with the detestable arts of
magic, he again was presumptuous: so that it
might well be said of him, as it was of the
Egyptian tyrant of old, that God had hardened
his heart."

CHAPTER XII.

Aow Constantine, after praying in his Taber
nacle, obtained the Victory.

BUT while Licinius, giving himself up to these
impieties, rushed blindly towards the gulf of
destruction, the emperor on the other hand,
when he saw that he must meet his enemies in
a second battle, devoted the intervening time to
his Saviour. He pitched the tabernacle of the
cross' outside and at a distance from his camp,
and there passed his time in a pure and holy
manner, offering up prayers to God ; following
thus the example of his ancient prophet, of

1 "Slaves," a word which has frequently been used by Eusebius

in this literal sense.

* This idiom here is nearly the English, "followed on the heels"

of any one.

* Ex. ix. 12.

| | This tabernacle, which Constantine always carried with him
in his military expeditions, is described by Sozomen, Bk. I, c. 8; see
English translation.- Bag.]

whom the sacred oracles testify, that he pitched
the tabernacle without the camp." He was
attended only by a few, whose faith and pious
devotion he highly esteemed.
And this custom
he continued to observe whenever he meditated
an engagement with the enemy.
For he was
deliberate in his measures, the better to insure
safety, and desired in everything to be directed
by divine counsel. And making earnest sup
plications to God, he was always honored after
a little with a manifestation of his presence.
And then, as if moved by a divine impulse, he
would rush from the tabernacle, and suddenly
give orders to his army to move at once without
delay, and on the instant to draw their swords.
On this they would immediately commence the
attack, fight vigorously, so as with incredible
celerity to secure the victory, and raise trophies
of victory over their enemies.

CHAPTER XIII.

His Humane Treatment of Prisoners.

THUS the emperor and his army had long
been accustomed to act, whenever there was a
prospect of an engagement; for his God was
ever present to his thoughts, and he desired to
do everything according to his will, and con
scientiously to avoid any wanton sacrifice of
human life. He was anxious thus for the preser
vation not only of his own subjects, but even of
Accordingly he directed his vic

torious troops to spare the lives of their pris
oners, admonishing them, as human beings, not
to forget the claims of their common nature.
And whenever he saw the passions of his sol
diery excited beyond control, he repressed their
fury by a largess of money, rewarding every
man who saved the life of an enemy with a
certain weight of gold. And the emperor's own
sagacity led him to discover this inducement to
spare human life, so that great numbers even of
the barbarians were thus saved, and owed their
lives to the emperor's gold.

CHAPTER XIV.

A Farther Mention of his Prayers in the
7ahermac/e.

Now these, and a thousand such acts as these,
were familiarly and habitually done by the em
peror.
And on the present occasion he retired,
as his custom was before battle, to the privacy
of his tabernacle, and there employed his time

stained from anything like ease, or luxurious
living, and disciplined himself by fasting and
bodily mortification, imploring the favor of God
by supplication and prayer, that he might ob
tain his concurrence and aid, and be ready to
execute whatever he might be pleased to sug
gest to his thoughts.
In short, he exercised a
vigilant care over all alike, and interceded with
God as much for the safety of his enemies as
for that of his own subjects.

CHAPTER XV.

Treacherous Friendship, and Idolatrous Prac
tices of Licinius.

AND inasmuch as he who had lately fled
before him now dissembled his real sentiments,
and again petitioned for a renewal of friendship
and alliance, the emperor thought fit, on cer
tain conditions, to grant his request,' in the
hope that such a measure might be expedient,
and generally advantageous to the community.
Licinius, however, while he pretended a ready
submission to the terms prescribed, and attested
his sincerity by oaths, at this very time was
secretly engaged in collecting a military force,
and again meditated war and strife, inviting even
the barbarians to join his standard," and he be

tions, he prepared for a decisive conflict with
him whose humanity prompted him still to hesi
tate, and to postpone the fate which he foresaw
awaited his adversary.
The enemy, however,
confident in the aid of a multitude of gods,
advanced to the attack with a powerful array of
military force, preceded by certain images of
the dead, and lifeless statues, as their defense.
On the other side, the emperor, secure in the
armor of godliness, opposed to the numbers of
the enemy the salutary and life-giving sign, as
at once a terror to the foe, and a protection
from every harm. And for a while he paused,
and preserved at first the attitude of forbearance,
from respect to the treaty of peace to which he
had given his sanction, that he might not be the
first to commence the contest.

CHAPTER XVII.

Constantine's Victory.

BUT as soon as he perceived that his adver
Saries persisted in their resolution, and were
already drawing their swords, he gave free scope
to his indignation, and by a single charge' over
threw in a moment the entire body of the
enemy, thus triumphing at once over them and
their gods.

HE then proceeded to deal with this adver

laws of war, and consign them to fitting punish

whose counsels had supported him in his im
piety, were together subjected to the just pun

account of the final struggle by which Licinius came into Constan

view that after he had been captured he again revolted.

THE LIFE OF

CONSTANTINE.

CHAPTER XIX.

Rejoicings and Festivities.

AND now, the impious being thus removed,
the sun once more shone brightly after the
gloomy cloud of tyrannic power.
Each sepa
rate portion of the Roman dominion became
blended with the rest ; the Eastern nations
united with those of the West, and the whole
body of the Roman empire was graced as it
were by its head in the person of a single and
supreme ruler, whose sole authority pervaded
the whole.
Now too the bright rays of the
light of godliness gladdened the days of those
who had heretofore been sitting in darkness and
the shadow of death.
Past sorrows were no
more remembered, for all united in celebrating
the praises of the victorious prince, and avowed
their recognition of his preserver as the only
true God. Thus he whose character shone with
all the virtues of piety, the emperor Victor, for
he had himself adopted this name as a most
fitting appellation to express the victory which
God had granted him over all who hated or
opposed him,' assumed the dominion of the
East, and thus singly governed the Roman em
pire, re-united, as in former times, under one
head.
Thus, as he was the first to proclaim to
all the sole sovereignty of God, so he himself,
as sole sovereign of the Roman world, extended
his authority over the whole human race.
Every
apprehension of those evils under the pressure
of which all had suffered was now removed ;
men whose heads had drooped in sorrow now
regarded each other with smiling countenances,
and looks expressive of their inward joy.
With
processions and hymns of praise they first of all,
as they were told, ascribed the supreme sover
eignty to God, as in truth the King of kings;
and then with continued acclamations rendered
honor to the victorious emperor, and the Caesars,
his most discreet and pious sons. The former
afflictions were forgotten, and all past impieties
forgiven: while with the enjoyment of present
happiness was mingled the expectation of con
tinued blessings in the future.

CHAPTER XX.

Constantine's Enactments in Favor of the Con
fessors.

MoREover, the emperor's edicts, permeated
with his humane spirit, were published among
us also, as they had been among the inhabitants

of the other division of the empire; and his
laws, which breathed a spirit of piety toward
God, gave promise of manifold blessings, since
they secured many advantages to his provincial
subjects in every nation, and at the same time
prescribed measures suited to the exigencies of
the churches of God.
For first of all they re
called those who, in consequence of their refusal
to join in idol worship, had been driven to exile,
or ejected from their homes by the governors of
their respective provinces.
In the next place,
they relieved from their burdens those who for
the same reason had been adjudged to serve in
the civil courts, and ordained restitution to be
made to any who had been deprived of prop
erty. They too, who in the time of trial had
signalized themselves by fortitude of soul in the
cause of God, and had therefore been con
demned to the painful labor of the mines, or
consigned to the solitude of islands, or com
pelled to toil in the public works, all received
an immediate release from these burdens; while
others, whose religious constancy had cost them
the forfeiture of their military rank, were vindi
cated by the emperor's generosity from this dis
honor: for he granted them the alternative either
of resuming their rank, and enjoying their former
privileges, or, in the event of their preferring a
more settled life, of perpetual exemption from
all service.
Lastly, all who had been compelled
by way of disgrace and insult to serve in the
employments of women,' he likewise freed with
the rest.

CHAPTER XXI.

His Laws concerning Martyrs, and concerning
Ecclesiastical Property.

SUCH were the benefits secured by the em
peror's written mandates to the persons of those
who had thus suffered for the faith, and his laws
made ample provision for their property also.

With regard to those holy martyrs of God who
had laid down their lives in the confession of His
name, he directed that their estates should be
enjoyed by their nearest kindred ; and, in de
fault of any of these, that the right of inherit
ance should be vested in the churches.
Farther,
whatever property had been consigned to other
parties from the treasury, whether in the way of
sale or gift, together with that retained in the
treasury itself, the generous mandate of the em
peror directed should be restored to the original
owners.
Such benefits did his bounty, thus
widely diffused, confer on the Church of God.

CHAPTER XXII.

Asow he won the Favor of the People.

BUT his munificence bestowed still further and
more numerous favors on the heathen peoples
and the other nations of his empire. So that
the inhabitants of our [Eastern] regions, who
had heard of the privileges experienced in the
opposite portion of the empire, and had blessed
the fortunate recipients of them, and longed for
the enjoyment of a similar lot for themselves,
now with one consent proclaimed their own
happiness, when they saw themselves in posses
sion of all these blessings; and confessed that
the appearance of such a monarch to the human
race was indeed a marvelous event, and such
as the world's history had never yet recorded.
Such were their sentiments.

CHAPTER XXIII.

7%at he declared God to be the Author of his
Prosperity ; and concerning his Aescripts.

AND now that, through the powerful aid of
God his Saviour, all nations owned their subjec
tion to the emperor's authority, he openly pro
claimed to all the name of Him to whose bounty
he owed all his blessings, and declared that He,
and not himself, was the author of his past victo
ries. This declaration, written both in the Latin
and Greek languages, he caused to be transmitted
through every province of the empire. Now the
excellence of his style of expression' may be
known from a perusal of his letters themselves,
which were two in number ; one addressed to
the churches of God ; the other to the heathen
population in the several cities of the empire.
The latter of these I think it well to insert here,
as connected with my present subject, in order
on the one hand that a copy of this document
may be recorded as matter of history, and thus
preserved to posterity, and on the other that it
may serve to confirm the truth of my present
narrative.
It is taken from an authentic copy
of the imperial statute in my own possession;
and the signature in the emperor's own hand
writing attaches as it were the impress of truth
to the statement I have made.

"To all who entertain just and sound senti
ments respecting the character of the Supreme
Being, it has long been most clearly evident,
and beyond the possibility of doubt, how vast
a difference there has ever been between those
who maintain a careful observance of the hal
lowed duties of the Christian religion, and those
who treat this religion with hostility or contempt.
But at this present time, we may see by still
more manifest proofs, and still more decisive
instances, both how unreasonable it were to
question this truth, and how mighty is the
power of the Supreme God: since it appears
that they who faithfully observe His holy laws,
and shrink from the transgression of His com
mandments, are rewarded with abundant bless
ings, and are endued with well-grounded hope
as well as ample power for the accomplishment
of their undertakings. On the other hand, they
who have cherished impious sentiments have
experienced results corresponding to their evil
choice.
For how is it to be expected that any
blessing would be obtained by one who neither
desired to acknowledge nor duly to worship that
God who is the source of all blessing?
Indeed,
facts themselves are a confirmation of what I

Say.

CHAPTER XXV.

An I//ustration from Ancient Times.

"For certainly any one who will mentally
retrace the course of events from the earliest
period down to the present time, and will re
flect on what has occurred in past ages, will
find that all who have made justice and probity
the basis of their conduct, have not only carried
their undertakings to a successful issue, but have
gathered, as it were, a store of sweet fruit as
the produce of this pleasant root.
Again, who
ever observes the career of those who have been
bold in the practice of oppression or injustice;
who have either directed their senseless fury
against God himself, or have conceived no
kindly feelings towards their fellow-men, but
have dared to afflict them with exile, disgrace,
confiscation, massacre, or other miseries of the
like kind, and all this without any sense of com
punction, or wish to direct thoughts to a better
course, will find that such men have received
a recompense proportioned
their crimes.
And these are results which might naturally and
reasonably be expected to ensue."

* There is a curious unanimity of effort on the part of theological
teurs, ancient and modern, to prove that those upon whom the
tower in Siloam fell were guiltier than others.
This was the spirit
of Lactantius and it is not to be wondered at that Constantine should
adopt such a peculiarly self-satisfying doctrine.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

Of Persecuted and Persecutors.

"For whoever have addressed themselves
with integrity of purpose to any course of ac
tion, keeping the fear of God continually before
their thoughts, and preserving an unwavering
faith in him, without allowing present fears or
dangers to outweigh their hope of future bless
ings - such persons, though for a season they
may have experienced painful trials, have borne
their afflictions lightly, being supported by the
belief of greater rewards in store for them; and
their character has acquired a brighter luster in
proportion to the severity of their past suffer
ings.
With regard, on the other hand, to those
who have either dishonorably slighted the princi
ples of justice, or refused to acknowledge the
Supreme God themselves, and yet have dared
to subject others who have faithfully maintained
his worship to the most cruel insults and pun
ishments; who have failed equally to recognize
their own wretchedness in oppressing others on
such grounds, and the happiness and blessing
of those who preserved their devotion to God
even in the midst of such sufferings: with regard,
I say, to such men, many a time have their
armies been slaughtered, many a time have they
been put to flight; and their warlike prepara
tions have ended in total ruin and defeat.

Zhat God chose Constantime to be the Minister
of Blessing.

"AND now, with such a mass of impiety op
pressing the human race, and the commonwealth
in danger of being utterly destroyed, as if by the
agency of some pestilential disease, and there
fore needing powerful and effectual aid ; what
was the relief, and what the remedy which the
Divinity devised for these evils?
(And by Divin
ity is meant the one who is alone and truly God,
the possessor of almighty and eternal power: and
surely it cannot be deemed arrogance in one who
has received benefits from God, to acknowledge
them in the loftiest terms of praise.)
I myself,
then, was the instrument whose services He
chose, and esteemed suited for the accomplish
ment of his will.
Accordingly, beginning at
the remote Britannic ocean, and the regions
where, according to the law of nature, the sun
sinks beneath the horizon, through the aid of
divine power I banished and utterly removed
every form of evil which prevailed, in the hope
that the human race, enlightened through my
instrumentality, might be recalled to a due ob
servance of the holy laws of God, and at the
same time our most blessed faith might prosper
under the guidance of his almighty hand.

CHAPTER XXVII.

Asow the Persecution became the Occasion of
Calamities to the Aggressors.

"FROM the causes I have described, grievous
wars arose, and destructive devastations. Hence
followed a scarcity of the common necessaries
of life, and a crowd of consequent miseries:
hence, too, the authors of these impieties have
either met a disastrous death of extreme suffer
ing, or have dragged out an ignominious exist
ence, and confessed it to be worse than death
itself, thus receiving as it were a measure of
punishment proportioned to the heinousness of

which he had been led to combat, and as he

ent life, but were tormented also by a most
lively apprehension of punishment in the future
world."

Constantine's Expressions of Piety toward's God';
and Praise of the Confessors.

"I SAID,' under the guidance of his hand; for
I would desire never to be forgetful of the grati
tude due to his grace.
Believing, therefore, that
this most excellent service had been confided to
me as a special gift, I proceeded as far as the
regions of the East, which, being under the pres
sure of severer calamities, seemed to demand still
more effectual remedies at my hands.
At the
same time I am most certainly persuaded that I
myself owe my life, my every breath, in short,
my very inmost and secret thoughts, entirely to
the favor of the Supreme God. Now I am well
aware that they who are sincere in the pursuit
of the heavenly hope, and have fixed this hope
in heaven itself as the peculiar and predominant
principle of their lives, have no need to depend
on human favor, but rather have enjoyed higher
honors in proportion as they have separated
themselves from the inferior and evil things of

incumbent on me to remove at once and most
completely from all such persons the hard neces
sities laid upon them for a season, and the unjust
inflictions under which they have suffered, though
free from any guilt or just liability.
For it would
be strange indeed, that the fortitude and con
stancy of soul displayed by such men should be
fully apparent during the reign of those whose
first object it was to persecute them on account
of their devotion to God, and yet that the glory
of their character should not be more bright and
blessed, under the administration of a prince
who is His servant.

CHAPTER XXX,

A Law granting Aeelease from Exile, from Ser
vice in the Courts, and from the Confiscation
of Property.

"LET all therefore who have exchanged their
country for a foreign land, because they would
not abandon that reverence and faith toward
God to which they had devoted themselves with
their whole hearts, and have in consequence at
different times been subject to the cruel sentence
of the courts; together with any who have been
enrolled in the registers of the public courts,
though in time past exempt from such office;
let these, I say, now render thanks to God the
Liberator of all, in that they are restored to their
hereditary property, and their wonted tranquility.
Let those also who have been despoiled of their
goods, and have hitherto passed a wretched
existence, mourning under the loss of all that
they possessed, once more be restored to their
former homes, their families, and estates, and
receive with joy the bountiful kindness of God.

CHAPTER XXXI.

Release likewise granted to Exiles in the Islands.

"FURTHERMORE, it is our command that all
those who have been detained in the islands
against their will should receive the benefit of
this present provision ; in order that they who
till now have been surrounded by rugged moun
tains and the encircling barrier of the ocean,
being now set free from that gloomy and deso
late solitude, may fulfill their fondest wish by
revisiting their dearest friends.
Those, too, who
have prolonged a miserable life in the midst of
abject and wretched squalor, welcoming their
restoration as an unlooked-for gain, and discard
ing henceforth all anxious thoughts, may pass
their lives with us in freedom from all fear.
For
that any one could live in a state of fear under
our government, when we boast and believe

ourselves to be the servants of God, would
surely be a thing most extraordinary even to
hear of, and quite incredible; and our mission
is to rectify the errors of the others.

CHAPTER XXXII.

And to

those ignominiously employed in the

Mines and Public Works.

"AGAIN, with regard to those who have been
condemned either to the grievous labor of the
mines, or to service in the public works, let them
enjoy the sweets of leisure in place of these long
continued toils, and henceforth lead a far easier
life, and more accordant with the wishes of their
hearts, exchanging the incessant hardships of
their tasks for quiet relaxation.
And if any
have forfeited the common privilege of liberty,
or have unhappily suffered dishonor," let them
hasten back every one to the country of his
nativity, and resume with becoming joy their
former positions in society, from which they
have been as it were separated by long residence
abroad.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

Concerning those Confessors engaged in Military
Service.

"ONCE more, with respect to those who had
previously been preferred to any military dis
tinction, of which they were afterwards deprived,
for the cruel and unjust reason that they chose
rather to acknowledge their allegiance to God
than to retain the rank they held ; we leave
them perfect liberty of choice, either to occupy
their former stations, should they be content
again to engage in military service, or after an
honorable discharge, to live in undisturbed tran
quillity.
For it is fair and consistent that men
who have displayed such magnanimity and forti
tude in meeting the perils to which they have
been exposed, should be allowed the choice
either of enjoying peaceful leisure, or resuming
their former rank.

to the women's apartments' and to the linen
making, there to undergo a cruel and miserable
labor, or reduced them to servitude for the
benefit of the public treasury, without any ex
emption on the ground of superior birth; let
such persons, resuming the honors they had
previously enjoyed, and their proper dignities,
henceforward exult in the blessings of liberty,
and lead a glad life.
Let the free man," too, by
some injustice and inhumanity, or even madness,
made a slave, who has felt the sudden transition
from liberty to bondage, and ofttimes bewailed
his unwonted labors, return to his family once
more a free man in virtue of this our ordinance,
and seek those employments which befit a state
of freedom ; and let him dismiss from his re
membrance those services which he found so
oppressive, and which so ill became his condi
tlon.

CHAPTER XXXV.

Of the Inheritance of the Property of Martyrs
and Confessors, also of those who had suffered
Banishment or Confiscation of Property.

tion in the noble and divine conflict of martyr
dom have also been stripped of their fortunes;
or if the same has been the lot of the confessors,
who have won for themselves the hope of eternal
treasures; or if the loss of property has befallen
those who were driven from their native land
because they would not yield to the persecutors,
and betray their faith; lastly, if any who have
escaped the sentence of death have yet been
despoiled of their worldly goods; we ordain that
the inheritances of all such persons be trans
ferred to their nearest kindred. And whereas
the laws expressly assign this right to those most
nearly related, it will be easy to ascertain to
whom these inheritances severally belong. And
it is evidently reasonable that the succession in
these cases should belong to those who would
have stood in the place of nearest affinity, had
the deceased experienced a natural death.

succeed in due course to the property of those
above-mentioned, I mean the martyrs, or con
fessors, or those who for some such cause have
been banished from their native land ; in such
cases we ordain that the church locally nearest
in each instance shall succeed to the inheritance.
And surely it will be no wrong to the departed
that that church should be their heir, for whose
sake they have endured every extremity of suf
fering. We think it necessary to add this also,
that in case any of the above-mentioned persons
have donated any part of their property in the
way of free gift, possession of such property
shall be assured, as is reasonable, to those who
have thus received it.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

Zand's, Gardens, or Houses, but not Actual
Produce from them, are to be given back.

"AND that there may be no obscurity in this
our ordinance, but every one may readily appre
hend its requirements, let all men hereby know
that if they are now maintaining themselves in
possession of a piece of land, or a house, or
garden, or anything else which had appertained
to the before-mentioned persons, it will be good
and advantageous for them to acknowledge the
fact, and make restitution with the least possible
delay. On the other hand, although it should
appear that some individuals have reaped abun
dant profits from this unjust possession, we do
not consider that justice demands the restitution
of such profits.
They must, however, declare
explicitly what amount of benefit they have thus
derived, and from what sources, and entreat our
pardon for this offense; in order that their past
covetousness may in some measure be atoned
for, and that the Supreme God may accept this
compensation as a token of contrition, and be
pleased graciously to pardon the sin.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

In what Manner Requests should be made for
these.

"But it is possible that those who have be

or possible to allow them such a title) will assure
us by way of apology for their conduct, that it
was not in their power to abstain from this ap
propriation at a time when a spectacle of misery

The Treasury must restore Zand's, Gardens,
and Houses to the Churches.

"NOR shall the treasury itself, should it have
any of the things we have spoken of, be per
mitted to keep them; but, without venturing
as it were to raise its voice against the holy
churches, it shall justly relinquish in their favor
what it has for a time unjustly retained. We
ordain, therefore, that
things whatsoever
which shall appear righteously to belong to the
churches, whether the property consist of houses,
or fields and gardens, or whatever the nature of
it may be, shall be restored in their full value
and integrity, and with undiminished right of

are honored in being the depositories of the

rials of their glorious departure; how can we
doubt that they rightly belong to the churches,
or refrain from issuing our injunction to that
effect? For surely there can be no better liber
ality, no labor more pleasing or profitable, than
to be thus employed under the guidance of the
Divine Spirit, in order that those things which
have been appropriated on false pretenses by
unjust and wicked men, may be restored, as jus
tice demands, and once more secured to the
holy churches.

CHAPTER XLI.

Those who have purchased Property belonging to
the Church, or received it as a Gift, are to
restore it.

who have either procured any such property by
right of purchase from the treasury, or have
retained it when conveyed to them in the form
of a gift; let all who have thus rashly indulged
their insatiable thirst of gain be assured that,
although by daring to make such purchases they
have done all in their power to alienate our
clemency from themselves, they shall neverthe
less not fail of obtaining it, so far as is possible
and consistent with propriety in each case.
So
much then is determined.

CHAPTER XLII.

An Earnest Exhortation to worship God.

"AND now, since it appears by the clearest
and most convincing evidence, that the miseries
which erewhile oppressed the entire human race
are now banished from every part of the world,
through the power of Almighty God, and at the
same time the counsel and aid which he is
pleased on many occasions to administer through
our agency; it remains for all, both individually
and unitedly, to observe and seriously consider
how great this power and how efficacious this
grace are, which have annihilated and utterly
destroyed this generation, as I may call them,
of most wicked and evil men; have restored joy
to the good, and diffused it over all countries;
and now guarantee the fullest authority both to
honor the Divine law as it should be honored,
with all reverence, and pay due observance to
those who have dedicated themselves to the
service of that law.

Statutes which forbade Sacrifice, and enjoined
the Building of Churches.

SOON after this, two laws were promulgated
about the same time ; one of which was in
tended to restrain the idolatrous abominations
which in time past had been practiced in every
city and country; and it provided that no one
should erect images, or practice divination and
other false and foolish arts, or offer sacrifice in
any way." The other statute commanded the
heightening of the oratories, and the enlarge
ment in length and breadth of the churches of
God; as though it were expected that, now the
madness of polytheism was wholly removed,
pretty nearly all mankind would henceforth
attach themselves to the service of God.
His
own personal piety induced the emperor to de
vise and write these instructions to the gov
ernors of the several provinces: and the law
farther admonished them not to spare the ex
penditure of money, but to draw supplies from

stretched his ample jurisdiction into the three parts of the globe
which were subject to the Romans, from the cataracts of the Nile to
the banks of the Phasis, and from the mountains of Thrace to the
frontiers of Persia.
2. The important provinces of Pannonia, Dacia,
Macedonia, and Greece once acknowledged the authority of the Pra:-
sect of Illyricum.
3. The power of the Praefect of Italy was not
confined to the country from whence he derived his title; it extended
over the additional territory of Rhaetia as far as the banks of the
Danube, over the dependent islands of the Mediterranean, and over
that part of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines
of Cyrene and those of Tingitania.
4. The Praefect of the Gauls

of Britain and Spain, and his authority was obeyed from J. wall of

churches; and the emperor was pleased to
transmit the same to myself, being the first
letter which he personally addressed to me.

Constantime's Zeffer to Eusebius and Other Bish
ops, respecting the Building of Churches, with
Instructions to repair the Old, and erect AVew
Ones on a Larger Scale, with the Aid of the
Prozoincia/ Governors.

"VICTOR CONSTANTINUs, MAXIMUS AUGUSTUs,

to Eusebius.

"Forasmuch as the unholy and willful rule of
servants of our
tyranny has persecuted the
Saviour until this present time, I believe and
have fully satisfied myself, best beloved brother,
that the buildings belonging to all the churches
have
either become ruinous through actual
neglect, or have received inadequate attention
from the dread of the violent spirit of the times.
"But now, that liberty is restored, and that
serpent" driven from the administration of pub
lic
affairs by the providence of the Supreme
God, and our instrumentality, we trust that all
can see the efficacy of the Divine power, and
that they who through fear of persecution or
through unbelief have fallen into any errors,
will now acknowledge the true God, and adopt
in future that course of life which is according
to truth and rectitude.
With respect, therefore,
to the churches over which you yourself preside,
as well as the bishops, presbyters, and deacons
of other churches with whom you are acquainted,
do you admonish all to be zealous in their at
tention to the buildings of the churches, and
either to repair or enlarge those which at pres
ent exist, or, in cases of necessity, to erect new
OneS.

"We also empower you, and the

others
through you, to demand what is needful for the
work, both from the provincial governors and
from the Praetorian Praefect.
For they have
received instructions to be most diligent in
obedience to your Holiness's orders. God pre
serve you, beloved brother." A copy of this
charge was transmitted throughout all the prov

men an adequate idea of the forethought and
intelligence of the divine order.
Nor can any,
whose minds are directed in the true path of
knowledge to the attainment of that end, enter
tain a doubt that the just perceptions of sound
reason, as well as those of the natural vision
itself, through the sole influence of genuine
virtue, lead to the knowledge of God. Accord
ingly no wise man will ever be surprised when
he sees the mass of mankind influenced by op
posite sentiments.
For the beauty of virtue
would be useless * and unperceived, did not
vice display in contrast with it the course of
perversity and folly.
Hence it is that the one
is crowned with reward, while the most high
God is himself the administrator of judgment
to the other.

all as explicitly as possible, the nature of my
own hopes of future happiness."

the charm of virtue."

Indeed, my father
was the only one who uniformly practiced the
duties of humanity, and with admirable piety
called for the blessing of God the Father on all
his actions, but the rest, unsound in mind, were
more zealous of cruel than gentle measures; and
this disposition they indulged without restraint,

the whole period of their reign.

tidings of a most serious disturbance which had

This intelli

endeavored to devise a remedy for the evil. The
origin of this disturbance may be thus described.
The people of God were in a truly flourishing
state, and abounding in the practice of good
works. No terror from without assailed them,
but a bright and most profound peace, through
the favor of God, encompassed his Church on
every side.

envy was watching to destroy our blessings,

selves, and arrayed them in angry hostility against
each other, on pretense of a jealous regard for
the doctrines of Divine truth.
Hence it was
that a mighty fire was kindled as it were from a
little spark, and which, originating in the first
instance in the Alexandrian church," overspread
the whole of Egypt and Libya, and the further
Thebaid.
Eventually it extended its ravages to
the other provinces and cities of the empire; so
that not only the prelates of the churches might
be seen encountering each other in the strife of
words, but the people themselves were com
pletely divided, some adhering to one faction
and others to another.
Nay, so notorious did
the scandal of these proceedings become, that
the sacred matters of inspired teaching were ex
posed to the most shameful ridicule in the very
theaters of the unbelievers.

As soon as the emperor was informed of these
facts, which he heard with much sorrow of heart,
considering them in the light of a calamity per

from the Christians in his train one whom he
well knew to be approved for the sobriety and
genuineness of his faith," and who had before
this time distinguished himself by the boldness
of his religious profession, and sent him to nego

Alexandria. He also made him the bearer of a
most needful and appropriate letter to the origi
nal movers of the strife : and this letter, as ex
hibiting a specimen of his watchful care over
God's people, it may be well to introduce into
this our narrative of his life.

Neither at this time nor at any time does Constantine scem to
have entered very fully into an appreciation of doctrinal niceties.
Later he was more than tolerant of semi-Arianism.
He seems
to have depended a good deal on the "explanations" of others,

"For as long as you continue to contend
about these small and very insignificant ques
tions, it is not fitting that so large a portion of
God's people should be under the direction of
your judgment, since you are thus divided be
tween yourselves.
I believe it indeed to be not
merely unbecoming, but positively evil, that such
should be the case.
But I will refresh your
minds by a little illustration, as follows. You
know that philosophers, though they all adhere
to one system, are yet frequently at issue on
certain points, and differ, perhaps, in
their
degree of knowledge: yet they are recalled to
harmony of sentiment by the uniting power of
their common doctrines.
If this be true, is it
not far more reasonable that you, who are the
ministers of the Supreme God, should be of one
mind respecting the profession of the same
religion?
But let us still more thoughtfully and
with closer attention examine what I have said,
and see whether it be right that, on the ground
of some trifling and foolish verbal difference

with the wisdom of priests and men of sense.
Let us withdraw ourselves with a good will from
these temptations of the devil.
Our great God
and common Saviour of all has granted the
same light to us all.
Permit me, who am his
servant, to bring my task to a successful issue,
under the direction of his Providence, that I
may be enabled, through my exhortations, and
diligence, and earnest admonition, to recall his
people to communion and fellowship. For since
you have, as I said, but one faith, and one sen
timent respecting our religion, and since the
Divine commandment in all its parts enjoins on
us all the duty of maintaining a spirit of concord,
let not the circumstance which has led to a slight
difference between you, since it does not affect
the validity of the whole, cause any division or
schism among you.
And this I say without in
any way desiring to force you to entire unity of
judgment in regard to this truly idle question,
whatever its real nature may be.
For the dig
nity of your synod may be preserved, and the
communion of your whole body maintained

nor is there such a thing as one disposition and
judgment common to all alike.
As far, then, as
regards the Divine Providence, let there be one
faith, and one understanding among you, one
united judgment in reference to God.
But as
to your subtle disputations on questions of little
or no significance, though you may be unable to
harmonize in sentiment, such differences should
be consigned to the secret custody of your own
minds and thoughts. And now, let the precious
ness of common affection, let faith in the truth,
let the honor due to God and to the observance
of his law continue immovably among you.

The Controversy continues without Abatement,
even after the Receipt of This Letter.

IN this manner the pious emperor endeavored
by means of the foregoing letter to promote the
peace of the Church of God. And the excel
lent man' to whom it was intrusted performed
his part not merely by communicating the letter
itself, but also by seconding the views of him
who sent it; for he was, as I have said, in all
respects a person of pious character. The evil,
however, was greater than could be remedied
by a single letter, insomuch that the acrimony
of the contending parties continually increased,
and the effects of the mischief extended to all
the Eastern provinces.
These things jealousy
and some evil spirit who looked with an envious
eye on the prosperity of the Church, wrought.

A Comparison of Constantine's Piety with the
Wickedness of the Persecutors.

IN this manner that spirit who is the hater of
good, actuated by envy at the blessing enjoyed
by the Church, continued to raise against her the
stormy troubles of intestine discord, in the midst
of a period of peace and joy.
Meanwhile, how
ever, the
divinely-favored emperor did not
slight the duties befitting him, but exhibited in
his whole conduct a direct contrast to those
atrocities of which the cruel tyrants had been
lately guilty,' and thus triumphed over every
enemy that opposed him. For in the first place,
the tyrants, being themselves alienated from the
true God, had enforced by every compulsion the
worship of false deities: Constantine convinced
mankind by actions as well as words," that these
had but an imaginary existence, and exhorted
them to acknowledge the only true God. They
had derided his Christ with words of blasphemy:
he assumed that as his safeguard" against which
they directed their blasphemies, and gloried in
the symbol of the Saviour's passion. They had
persecuted and driven from house and home the
servants of Christ: he recalled them every one,
and restored them to their native homes. They
had covered them with dishonor: he made their
condition honorable and enviable in the eyes
of all. They had shamefully plundered and sold
the goods of godly men: Constantine not only
replaced this loss, but still further enriched them

on the contrary, conferred dignity on these indi

edicts and statutes raised them to higher distinc
tion than before. They had utterly demolished
and razed to the ground the houses of prayer:

should be enlarged, and that new ones should be

They had ordered the
inspired records to be burnt and utterly de

be multiplied, and magnificently adorned
at
the charge of the imperial treasury. They had
strictly forbidden the prelates, anywhere or on
any occasion, to convene synods; whereas he
gathered them to his court from every province,
received them into his palace, and even to his
own private apartments and thought them worthy
to share his home and table. They had honored
the demons with offerings: Constantine exposed
their error, and continually distributed the now
useless materials for sacrifice, to those who would
apply them to a better use.

it must seem to all who duly regard these facts,
that a new and fresh era of existence had begun
to appear, and a light heretofore unknown sud

human race : and all must confess that these
things were entirely the work of God, who raised
up this pious emperor to withstand the multitude
of the ungodly.

CHAPTER II.

Farther Remarks on Constantine's Piety, and
his Open Testimony to the Sign of the Cross.

AND when we consider that their iniquities
were without example, and the atrocities which
they dared to perpetrate against the Church
such as had never been heard of in any age of
the world, well might God himself bring before
us something entirely new, and work thereby
effects such as had hitherto been never either
recorded or observed. And what miracle was
ever more marvelous than the virtues of this
our emperor, whom the wisdom of God has
vouchsafed as a gift to the human race?
For
truly he maintained a continual testimony to the
Christ of God with all boldness, and before all
men; and so far was he from shrinking from an
open profession of the Christian name, that he
rather desired to make it manifest to all that
he regarded this as his highest honor, now im
pressing on his face the salutary sign, and now
glorying in it as the trophy which led him on to
victory."

AND besides this, he caused to be painted on
a lofty tablet, and set up in the front of the por
tico of his palace, so as to be visible to all, a
representation of the salutary sign placed above
his head, and below it that hateful and savage
adversary of mankind, who by means of the
tyranny of the ungodly had wasted the Church
of God, falling headlong, under the form of a

In this manner he intended to represent the
secret adversary of the human race, and to indi
cate that he was consigned to the gulf of per
dition by virtue of the salutary trophy placed
above his head.
This allegory, then, was thus
conveyed by means of the colors of a picture :
and I am filled with wonder at the intellectual
greatness of the emperor, who as if by divine
inspiration thus expressed what the prophets
had foretold concerning this monster, saying
that "God would bring his great and strong
and terrible sword against the dragon, the flying
serpent ; and would destroy the dragon that was
in the sea." This it was of which the emperor
gave a true and faithful representation in the
picture above described.

CHAPTER IV.

A Farther Motice of the Controversies raised
in Egypt by Arius.

IN such occupations as these he employed
himself with pleasure : but the effects of that
envious spirit which so troubled the peace of
the churches of God in Alexandria, together
with the Theban and Egyptian schism, con
tinued to cause him no little disturbance of
mind.
For in fact, in every city bishops were
engaged in obstinate conflict with bishops, and
people rising against people; and almost like
the fabled Symplegades,' coming into violent
collision with each other.
Nay, some were so
far transported beyond the bounds of reason as
to be guilty of reckless and outrageous conduct,
and even to insult the statues of the emperor.
This state of things had little power to excite
his anger, but rather caused in him sorrow of
spirit; for he deeply deplored the folly thus
exhibited by deranged men.

Church; I mean the difference respecting the
salutary feast of Easter."
For while one party
asserted that the Jewish custom should be ad
hered to, the other affirmed that the exact
recurrence of the period should be observed,
without following the authority of those who
were in error, and strangers to gospel grace.

Accordingly, the people being thus in every
place divided in respect of this,' and the sacred
observances of religion confounded for a long
period (insomuch that the diversity of judgment
in regard to the time for celebrating one and
the same feast caused the greatest disagreement
between those who kept it, some afflicting them
selves with fastings and austerities, while others
devoted their time to festive relaxation), no one
appeared who was capable of devising a remedy
for the evil, because the controversy continued
equally balanced between both parties. To God
alone, the Almighty, was the healing of these
differences an easy task; and Constantine ap

soon as he was made acquainted with the facts
which I have described, and perceived that his
letter to the Alexandrian Christians had failed
to produce its due effect, he at once aroused
the energies of his mind, and declared that he
must prosecute to the utmost this war also
against the secret adversary who was disturbing
the peace of the Church.

CHAPTER VI.

Aow he ordered a Council to be held at AWicaca.

THEN as if to bring a divine array against this
enemy, he convoked a general council, and
invited the speedy attendance of bishops from
all quarters, in letters expressive of the honora
ble estimation in which he held them.
Nor
was this merely the issuing of a bare command,
but the emperor's good will contributed much
to its being carried into effect: for he allowed
some the use of the public means of conveyance,
while he afforded to others an ample supply of
horses' for their transport.
The place, too,
selected for the synod, the city Nicaea in Bithy
nia (named from "Victory"), was appropriate
to the occasion." As soon then as the imperial
injunction was generally made known, all with

the utmost willingness hastened thither, as though
they would outstrip one another in a race; for
they were impelled by the anticipation of a
happy result to the conference, by the hope of
enjoying present peace, and the desire of be
holding something new and strange in the per
son of so admirable an emperor. Now when
they were all assembled, it appeared evident that
the proceeding was the work of God, inasmuch
as men who had been most widely separated,
not merely in sentiment, but also personally,
and by difference of country, place, and nation,
were here brought together, and comprised
within the walls of a single city, forming as it
were a vast garland of priests, composed of a
variety of the choicest flowers.

of peace, and presented it to his Saviour as a
thank-offering for the victories he had obtained
over every foe, thus exhibiting in our own times
a similitude of the apostolic company.

in Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene ;
and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and prose

But that assembly

friends in the faith. And now, all rising at the

devise no other means for exposing the divine
law to blasphemous calumny; for, in my judg
ment, intestine strife within the Church of God
is far more evil and dangerous than any kind
of war or conflict; and these our differences
appear to me more grievous than any outward
trouble.
Accordingly, when, by the will and
with the co-operation of God, I had been vic
torious over my enemies, I thought that nothing
more remained but to render thanks to him,
and sympathize in the joy of those whom he
had restored to freedom through my instrumen
tality; as soon as I heard that intelligence which
I had least expected to receive, I mean the
news of your dissension, I judged it to be of no
secondary importance, but with the earnest de
sire that a remedy for this evil also might be
found through my means, I immediately sent
to require your presence. And now I rejoice
in beholding your assembly; but I feel that my
desires will be most completely fulfilled when I
can see you all united in one judgment, and
that common spirit of peace and concord pre
vailing amongst you all, which it becomes you,
as consecrated to the service of God, to com
mend to others.
Delay not, then, dear friends:
delay not, ye ministers of God, and faithful ser
vants of him who is our common Lord and
Saviour: begin from this moment to discard
the causes of that disunion which has existed
among you, and remove the perplexities of con
troversy by embracing the principles of peace.
For by such conduct you will at the same time
be acting in a manner most pleasing to the
supreme God, and you will confer an exceeding
favor on me who am your fellow-servant."

* The earnest desire of Constantine to promote peace in the
church makes one judge with leniency the o: arbitrary and very
mechanical method he often took to secure it. As over against the
unity of form or the unity of compromise, there is one only real
unity - a unity in the truth, being one in the Truth. The secret of
peace is reason with right.

As soon as the emperor had spoken these
words in the Latin tongue, which another in
terpreted, he gave permission to those who
presided in the council to deliver their opinions.
On this some began to accuse their neighbors,
who defended themselves, and recriminated in
their turn.
In this manner numberless asser
tions were put forth by each party, and a violent
controversy arose at the very commencement.
Notwithstanding this, the emperor gave patient
audience to all alike, and received every propo
sition with steadfast attention, and by occasion
ally assisting the argument of each party in turn,
he gradually disposed even the most vehement
disputants to a reconciliation.
At the same
time, by the affability of his address to all, and
his use of the Greek language, with which he
was not altogether unacquainted, he appeared
in a truly attractive and amiable light, persuad
ing some, convincing others by his reasonings,
praising those who spoke well, and urging all to
unity of sentiment, until at last he succeeded in
bringing them to one mind and judgment re
specting every disputed question.

CHAPTER XIV.

Unanimous Declaration of the Counci/ concern
ing Faith, and the Celebration of Easter.

THE result was that they were not only united
as concerning the faith, but that the time for
the celebration of the salutary feast of Easter
was agreed on by all. Those points also which
were sanctioned by the resolution of the whole
body were committed to writing, and received
the signature of each several member.' Then
the emperor, believing that he had thus ob
tained a second victory over the adversary of
the Church, proceeded to solemnize a triumphal
festival in honor of God.

CHAPTER XV.

Asow Constantine entertained the Bishops on the
Occasion of his Vicennalia.

ABOUT this time he completed the twentieth
year of his reign." On this occasion public
festivals were celebrated by the people of the
provinces generally, but the emperor himself
invited and feasted with those ministers of God

the body-guard and other troops surrounded
the entrance of the palace with drawn swords,
and through the midst of these the men of God
proceeded without fear into the innermost of the
imperial apartments, in which some were the
emperor's own companions at table, while others
reclined on couches arranged on either side."
One might have thought that a picture of
Christ's kingdom was thus shadowed forth, and
a dream rather than reality.

CHAPTER XVI.

Presents to the Bishops, and Zetters to the People
generally.

AFTER the celebration of this brilliant festival,
the emperor courteously received all his guests,
and generously added to the favors he had
already bestowed by personally presenting gifts
to each individual according to his rank. He
also gave information of the proceedings of the
synod to those who had not been present, by a
letter in his own hand-writing. And this letter
also I will inscribe as it were on some monu
ment by inserting it in this my narrative of his
life.

It was as follows:

the Council at Micaea.

"CONSTANTINUS AUGUSTUs, to the Churches.
"Having had full proof, in the general pros

has been towards us, I have judged that it ought
to be the first object of my endeavors, that unity
of faith, sincerity of love, and community of feel
ing in regard to the worship of Almighty God,
might be preserved among the highly favored
multitude who compose the Catholic Church.
And, inasmuch as this object could not be effect
ually and certainly secured, unless all, or at

to meet together, and a discussion of all partic
ulars relating to our most holy religion to take

Ase speaks of their Unanimity respecting the
Feast of Easter, and against the Practice of

passion; and he has willed that his Catholic
Church should be one, the members of which,
however scattered in many and diverse places,
are yet cherished by one pervading spirit, that
is, by the will of God. And let your Holinesses'
sagacity reflect how grievous and scandalous it
is that on the self-same days some should be
engaged in fasting, others in festive enjoyment;
and again, that after the days of Easter some
should be present at banquets and amusements,
while others are fulfilling the appointed fasts.
It is, then, plainly the will of Divine Providence
(as I suppose you all clearly see), that this usage
should receive fitting correction, and be reduced
to one uniform rule.

CHAPTER XIX.

Exhortation to follow

the Example of the

Greater Part of the World.

"SINCE, therefore, it was needful that this
matter should be rectified, so that we might
have nothing in common with that nation of
parricides who slew their Lord : and since that
arrangement is consistent with propriety which
is observed by all the churches of the western,
southern, and northern parts of the world, and
by some of the eastern also: for these reasons
all are unanimous on this present occasion in
thinking it worthy of adoption. And I myself
have undertaken that this decision should meet
with the approval of your Sagacities,' in the
hope that your Wisdoms' will gladly admit that
practice which is observed at once in the city
of Rome, and in Africa; throughout Italy, and
in Egypt, in Spain, the Gauls, Britain, Libya, and
the whole of Greece; in the dioceses of Asia
and Pontus, and in Cilicia, with entire unity of

judgment. And you will consider not only that
the number of churches is far greater in the
regions I have enumerated than in any other,
but also that it is most fitting that all should
unite in desiring that which sound reason ap
pears to demand, and in avoiding all participa
tion in the perjured conduct of the Jews."
In
fine, that I may express my meaning in as few
words as possible, it has been determined by
the common judgment of all, that the most holy
feast of Easter should be kept on one and the
same day.
For on the one hand a discrepancy
of opinion on so sacred a question is unbecom
ing, and on the other it is surely best to act on
a decision which is free from strange folly and
error.

The emperor transmitted a faithful copy' of
this letter to every province, wherein they who
read it might discern as in a mirror the pure
sincerity of his thoughts, and of his piety toward
God.

CHAPTER XXI.

Recommendation to the Bishops, on their Depar

of being finally dissolved, he summoned all the
bishops to meet him on an appointed day, and
on their arrival addressed them in a farewell

blaspheme the word of God: whom indeed we
should do all in our power to save, and this

But you are well aware of the fact,
that testimony is by no means productive of

to the end that the saving doctrine may be fully

part of his exhortation;' and in conclusion he
enjoined them to offer diligent supplications to

Having thus taken leave of

their respective countries; and this they did

that ample gifts of money should be bestowed

occasion of the twentieth anniversary of his
reign.

CHAPTER XXIII.

How he wrote to the Egyptians, exhorting them
to Peace.

AND now, when all else were at peace, among
the Egyptians alone an implacable contention
still raged, so as once more to disturb the
emperor's tranquillity, though not to excite his
anger.
For indeed he treated the contend
ing parties with all respect, as fathers, nay rather,
as prophets of God; and again he summoned
them to his presence, and again patiently acted
as mediator between them, and honored them
with gifts, and communicated also the result of
his arbitration by letter. He confirmed and
sanctioned the
council, and

THE LIFE OF CONSTANTINE.

then was this work? He judged it incumbent
on him to render the blessed locality of our
Saviour's resurrection an object of attraction
and veneration to all. He issued immediate
injunctions, therefore, for the erection in that
spot of a house of prayer: and this he did, not
on the mere natural impulse of his own mind,
but being moved in spirit by the Saviour himself.

CHAPTER XXVI.

That the Holy Sepulchre had been covered with
Rubbish and with Idols by the Ungodly.

For it had been in time past the endeavor of
impious men (or rather let me say of the whole
race of evil spirits through their means), to con
sign to the darkness of oblivion that divine mon
ument of immortality to which the radiant angel
had descended from heaven, and rolled away
the stone for those who still had stony hearts,
and who supposed that the living One still lay
among the dead; and had declared glad tidings
to the women also, and removed their stony
hearted unbelief by the conviction that he whom
they sought was alive.
This sacred cave, then,
certain impious and godless persons had thought
to remove entirely from the eyes of men, sup
posing in their folly that thus they should be
able effectually to obscure the truth. Accord
ingly they brought a quantity of earth from
a distance with much labor, and covered the
entire spot; then, having raised this to a moder
ate height, they paved it with stone, concealing
the holy cave beneath this massive mound.
Then, as though their purpose had been effect
ually accomplished, they prepare on this founda
tion a truly dreadful sepulchre of souls, by
building a gloomy shrine of lifeless idols to the
impure spirit whom they call Venus, and offer.
ing detestable oblations therein on profane and
accursed altars.
For they supposed that their
object could not otherwise be fully attained,
than by thus burying the sacred cave beneath
these foul pollutions.
they
were unable to comprehend how impossible it
was that their attempt should remain unknown
to him who had been crowned with victory over
death, any more than the blazing sun, when he
rises above the earth, and holds his wonted
course through the midst of heaven, is unseen
by the whole race of mankind.
Indeed, his
saving power, shining with still greater bright
ness, and illumining, not the bodies, but the
souls of men, was already filling the world with
the effulgence of its own light.
Nevertheless,
these devices of impious and wicked men against
the truth had prevailed for a long time, nor had
any one of the governors, or military command

Unhappy men

ers, or even of the emperors themselves ever
yet appeared, with ability to abolish these daring
impieties, save only that one who enjoyed the
favor of the King of kings. And now, acting
as he did under the guidance of the divine
Spirit, he could not consent to see the sacred
spot of which we have spoken, thus buried,
through the devices of the adversaries, under
every kind of impurity, and abandoned to for
getfulness and neglect; nor would he yield to
the malice of those who had contracted this
guilt, but calling on the divine aid, gave orders
that the place should be thoroughly purified,
thinking that the parts which had been most
polluted by the enemy ought to receive special
tokens, through his means, of the greatness of
the divine favor.
As soon, then, as his com
mands were issued, these engines of deceit were
cast down from their proud eminence to the
very ground, and the dwelling-places of error,
with the statues and the evil spirits which they
represented, were overthrown and utterly de
stroyed.

CHAPTER XXVII.

How Constantine commanded the Materials of
the Idol Temple, and the Soil itself, to be re
moved at a Dissance.

Nor did the emperor's zeal stop here; but
he gave further orders that the materials of what
was thus destroyed, both stone and timber,
should be removed and thrown as far from the
spot as possible; and this command also was
speedily executed. The emperor, however, was
not satisfied with having proceeded thus far:
once more, fired with holy ardor, he directed
that the ground itself should be dug up to a
considerable depth, and the soil which had been
polluted by the foul impurities of demon wor
ship transported to a far distant place.

Discovery of the Most Holy Sepulchre."

This also was accomplished without delay.
But as soon as the original surface of the ground,
beneath the covering of earth, appeared, im
mediately, and contrary to all expectation, the
venerable and hallowed monument of our Sav
iour's resurrection was discovered. Then indeed
did this most holy cave present a faithful simili

tude of his return to life, in that, after lying
buried in darkness, it again emerged to light,
and afforded to all who came to witness the
sight, a clear and visible proof of the wonders
of which that spot had once been the scene, a
testimony to the resurrection of the Saviour
clearer than any voice could give.

CHAPTER XXIX.

AIow, he wrote concerning the Erection of a
Church, both to the Governors of the Proto
inces, and to the Bishop Macarius.

IMMEDIATELY after the transactions I have
recorded, the emperor sent forth injunctions
which breathed a truly pious spirit, at the same
time granting ample supplies of money, and
commanding that a house of prayer worthy of
the worship of God should be erected near the
Saviour's tomb on a scale of rich and royal
greatness.
This object he had indeed for some
time kept in view, and had foreseen, as if by
the aid of a superior intelligence, that which
should afterwards come to pass. He laid his
commands, therefore, on the governors of the
Eastern provinces, that by an abundant and un
sparing expenditure they should secure
the
completion of the work on a scale of noble and
ample magnificence. He also despatched the
following letter to the bishop who at that time
presided over the church at Jerusalem, in which
he clearly asserted the saving doctrine of the
faith, writing in these terms.

CHAPTER XXX.

Constantine's Letter to Macarius respecting the
Building of the Church of our Saviour.

"Victor CONSTANTIUS, MAXIMUS AUGUSTUs, to

Macarius.

"Such is our Saviour's grace, that no power
of language seems adequate to describe the
wondrous circumstance to which I am about to
refer.
For, that the monument of his most
holy Passion, so long ago buried beneath the
ground, should have remained unknown for so
long a series of years, until its reappearance to
his servants now set free through the removal
of him who was the common enemy of all, is
a fact which truly surpasses all admiration.
For
if all who are accounted wise throughout the
world were to unite in their endeavors to say
somewhat worthy of this event, they would be
unable to attain their object in the smallest
degree.
Indeed, the nature of this miracle as
far transcends the capacity of human reason as

1 [Licinius appears to be meant, whose death had occurred A.D.
326, in which }. the alleged discovery of the Lord's sepulchre
took place. - Bag.]

heavenly things are superior to human affairs.
For this cause it is ever my first, and indeed
my only object, that, as the authority of the
truth is evincing itself daily by fresh wonders,
so our souls may all become more zealous, with
all sobriety and earnest unanimity, for the honor
of the Divine law.
I desire, therefore, especially,
that you should be persuaded of that which I
suppose is evident to all beside, namely, that I
have no greater care than how I may best adorn
with a splendid structure that sacred spot, which,
under Divine direction, I have disencumbered
as it were of the heavy weight of foul idol
worship ; a spot which has been accounted holy
from the beginning in God's judgment, but
which now appears holier still, since it has
brought to light a clear assurance of our Sav
iour's passion.

"It will be well, therefore, for your sagacity
to make such arrangements and provision of all
things needful for the work, that not only the
church itself as a whole may surpass all others
whatsoever in beauty, but that the details of the
building may be of such a kind that the fairest
structures in any city of the empire may be ex
celled by this. And with respect to the erection
and decoration of the walls, this is to inform you
that our friend Dracilianus, the deputy of the
Praefects, and the governor of the
Praetorian
province, have received a charge from us.
For
our pious directions to them are to the effect
that artificers and laborers, and whatever they
shall understand from your sagacity to be need
ful for the advancement of the work, shall forth
with be furnished by their care. And as to the
columns and marbles, whatever you shall judge,
after actual inspection of the plan, to be espe
cially precious and serviceable, be diligent to
send information to us in writing, in order that
whatever quantity or sort of materials we shall
esteem from your letter to be needful, may be

is fitting that the most marvelous place in the
world should be worthily decorated.

old, which, since the foul stain of guilt brought

was opposite this city that the emperor now
began to rear a monument to the Saviour's vic
tory over death, with rich and lavish magnifi
cence. And it may be that this was that second
and new Jerusalem spoken of in the predictions
of the prophets,' concerning which such abun
dant testimony is given in the divinely inspired
records.

First of all, then, he adorned the sacred cave
itself, as the chief part of the whole work, and
the hallowed monument at which the angel
radiant with light had once declared to all that
regeneration which was first manifested in the
Saviour's person.

For at the side opposite to the cave, which
was the eastern side, the church
itself was
erected ; a noble work rising to a vast height,
and of great extent both in length and breadth.
The interior of this structure was floored with
marble slabs of various colors; while the exter
nal surface of the walls, which shone with pol
ished stones exactly fitted together, exhibited a
degree of splendor in no respect inferior to that
of marble.
With regard to the roof, it was
covered on the outside with lead, as a protec
tion against the rains of winter.
But the inner
part of the roof, which was finished with sculp
tured panel work, extended in a series of con
nected compartments, like a vast sea, over the
whole church ;
and, being overlaid throughout
with the purest gold, caused the entire building
to glitter as it were with rays of light.

Description of the Double Porticos on Either
Side, and of the Three Eastern Gates.

with upper and lower ranges of pillars,' corre.
sponding in length with the church itself; and
these also had their roofs ornamented with gold.
Of these porticos, those which were exterior to
the church were supported by columns of great
size, while those within these rested on piles* of

out of heaven," &c.; an extraordinary, nay, almost ludicrous appli
cation of Scripture, though perhaps characteristic of the author's
age.-- Rag.] And it may be said characteristic of Eusebius him
self, for it is not his only sin in this regard.

* It would seem from this description that the paneling was like
that of Santa Maria Maggiore at Rome, a horizontal surface rather
than the pointed roof paneled.

* Whether this means two series, one underground and one
above (Mo'o. and many), or not, is fully discussed by Heinichen in
a separate note (AE used sus, vol. 3, p. 520-521).

lavish magnificence.
In the one case, he ren
dered due honor to that which had been the
scene of the first manifestation of our Saviour's
divine presence, when he submitted to be born
in mortal flesh ; while in the case of the second
cavern he hallowed the remembrance of his
ascension to heaven from the mountain top.
And while he thus nobly testified his reverence
for these places, he at the same time eternized
the memory of his mother,' who had been the
instrument of conferring so valuable a benefit
on mankind.

he who was "God with us" had submitted to be
born even in a cave' of the earth, and the
place of his nativity was called Bethlehem by
the Hebrews.
Accordingly the pious empress
honored with rare memorials the scene of her
travail who bore this heavenly child, and beauti
fied the sacred cave with all possible splendor.
The emperor himself soon after testified his
reverence for the spot by princely offerings, and
added to his mother's magnificence by costly
presents of silver and gold, and embroidered
hangings.
And farther, the mother of the em.
peror raised a stately structure on the Mount of
Olives also, in memory of his ascent to heaven
who is the Saviour of mankind, erecting a sacred
church and temple on the very summit of the
mount. And indeed authentic history informs
us that in this very cave the Saviour imparted
his secret revelations to his
disciples." And
here also the emperor testified his reverence for
the King of kings, by diverse and costly offer
ings.
Thus did Helena Augusta, the pious
mother of a pious emperor, erect over the two
mystic caverns these two noble and beautiful
monuments of devotion, worthy of everlasting
remembrance, to the honor of God her Saviour,
and as proofs of her holy zeal, receiving from
Nor
her son the aid of his imperial power.
was it long ere this aged woman reaped the due
reward of her labors.
After passing the whole
period of her life, even to declining age, in the
greatest prosperity, and exhibiting both in word
and deed abundant fruits of obedience to the
divine precepts, and having enjoyed in conse
quence an easy and tranquil existence, with un
impaired powers of body and mind, at length
she obtained from God an end befitting her
pious course, and a recompense of her good
deeds even in this present life.

CHAPTER XLIV.

Of Helena's Generosity and Beneficent Acts.

For on the occasion of a circuit which she
made of the eastern provinces, in the splendor
of imperial authority, she bestowed abundant
proofs of her liberality as well on the inhabitants
of the several cities collectively, as on individ
uals who approached her, at the same time that
she scattered largesses among the soldiery with

the gifts she bestowed on the naked and unpro
tected poor. To some she gave money, to
others an ample supply of clothing : she liber
ated some from imprisonment, or from the bitter
servitude of the mines; others she delivered
from unjust oppression, and others again, she
restored from exile.

CHAPTER XLV.

Aselena's Pious Conduct in the Churches.

WHILE, however, her character derived luster
from such deeds as I have described, she was
far from neglecting personal piety toward God."
She might be seen continually frequenting his
Church, while at the same time she adorned the
houses of prayer with splendid offerings, not
overlooking the churches of the smallest cities.
In short, this admirable woman was to be seen,
in simple and modest attire, mingling with the
crowd of worshipers, and testifying her devotion
to God by a uniform course of pious conduct.

CHAPTER XLVI,

Asow she made her Will, and died at the Age of
Eighty Years.

AND when at length at the close of a long life,
she was called to inherit a happier lot, having
arrived at the eightieth year of her age, and be
ing very near the time of her departure, she
prepared and executed her last will in favor of
her only son, the emperor and sole monarch of
the world, and her grandchildren, the Caesars
his sons, to whom severally she bequeathed
whatever property she possessed in any part of
the world.
Having thus made her will, this
thrice blessed woman died in the presence of
her illustrious son, who was in attendance at
her side, caring for her and held her hands: so
that, to those who rightly discerned the truth,
the thrice blessed one seemed not to die, but to
experience a real change and transition from an
earthly to a heavenly existence, since her soul,
remoulded as it were into an incorruptible and
angelic essence," was received up into her Sav
iour's presence."

conversion to #. mother (compare the op. letters mentioned
1 According to some apocryphal accounts Constantine owed his
under Writings, in the Prolegomena), but
below (ch.
47), seems to reverse the fact.

Eusebius was much addicted.

according to the testimony of Jerome.
: The date of Helena's death is usually placed in 327 or 328.

time of her death she must have been about twenty-five when Con
stantine was born.

CHAPTER XLVII.

Asow Constantime buried his Mother, and how
he honored her during her Life.

HER body, too, was honored with special
tokens of respect, being escorted on its way to
the imperial city by a vast train of guards, and
there deposited in a royal tomb.
Such were
the last days of our emperor's mother, a person
worthy of being had in perpetual remembrance,
both for her own practical piety, and because
she had given birth to so extraordinary and ad
mirable an offspring.
And well may his char
acter be styled blessed, for his filial piety as well
as on other grounds. He rendered her through
his influence so devout a worshiper of God,
(though she had not previously been such,)
that she seemed to have been instructed from
the first by the Saviour of mankind; and besides
this, he had honored her so fully with imperial
dignities, that in every province, and in the very
ranks of the soldiery, she was spoken of under
the titles of Augusta and empress, and her like
ness was impressed on golden coins.' He had
even granted her authority over the imperial
treasures, to use and dispense them according
to her own will and discretion in every case:
for this enviable distinction also she received at
the hands of her son.
Hence it is that among
the qualities which shed a luster on his memory,
we may rightly include that surpassing degree of
filial affection whereby he rendered full obedi
ence to the Divine precepts which enjoin due
honor from children to their parents.
In this
manner, then, the emperor executed in Palestine
the noble works I have above described : and
indeed in every province he raised new churches
on a far more imposing scale than those which
had existed before his time.

CHAPTER XLVIII.

J/ow he built Chi:rches in Honor of Martyrs,
and abo/ished Ido/atry at Constantinople.

AND being fully resolved to distinguish the
city which bore his name with especial honor,
he embellished it with numerous sacred edifices,
both memorials of martyrs on the largest scale,
and other buildings of the most splendid kind,
not only within the city itself, but in its vicinity:
and thus at the same time he rendered honor
to the memory of the martyrs, and consecrated
his city to the martyrs' God.
Being filled, too,
with Divine wisdom, he determined to purge

ver and copper coins have been found with her name, none of gold
have yet come to light.

the city which was to be distinguished by his
own name from idolatry of every kind, that
henceforth no statues might be worshiped there
in the temples of those falsely reputed to be
gods, nor any altars defiled by the pollution of
blood: that there might be no sacrifices con
sumed by fire, no demon festivals, nor any of
the other ceremonies usually observed by the
superstitious.

CHAPTER XLIX.

Representation of the Cross in the Palace, and
of Daniel at the Public Fountains.

ON the other hand one might see the foun
tains in the midst of the market place graced
with figures representing the good Shepherd,
well known to those who study the sacred ora
cles, and that of Daniel also with the lions,
forged in brass, and resplendent with plates of
gold.
Indeed, so large a measure of Divine
love possessed the emperor's soul, that in the
principal apartment of the imperial palace itself,
on a vast tablet' displayed in the center of its
gold-covered paneled ceiling, he caused the sym
bol of our Saviour's Passion to be fixed, composed
of a variety of precious stones richly inwrought
with gold.
This symbol he seemed to have
intended to be as it were the safeguard of the
empire itself.

CHAPTER L.

That he erected Churches in Micomedia, and in
Other Cities.

HAVING thus embellished the city which bore
his name, he next distinguished the capital of
Bithynia' by the erection of a stately and mag
nificent church, being desirous of raising in this
city also, in honor of his Saviour and at his
own charges, a memorial of his victory over his
own enemies and the adversaries of God. He
also decorated the principal cities of the other
provinces with sacred edifices of great beauty;
as, for example, in the case of that metropolis
of the East which derived its name from An
tiochus, in which, as the head of that portion
of the empire, he consecrated to the service of
God a church of unparalleled size and beauty.
The entire building was encompassed by an en
closure of great extent, within which the church
itself rose to a vast elevation, being of an oc
tagonal form, and surrounded on all sides by

profusion of gold, brass, and other materials of
the most costly kind.

CHAPTER LI.

That he ordered a Church to be built at Mambre.

SUCH was the principal sacred edifices erected
by the emperor's command.
But having heard
that the self-same Saviour who erewhile had
appeared on earth' had in ages long since past
afforded a manifestation of his Divine presence
to holy men of Palestine near the oak of Mambre,"
he ordered that a house of prayer should be built
there also in honor of the God who had thus
appeared.
Accordingly the imperial commis
sion was transmitted to the provincial governors
by letters addressed to them individually, enjoin
ing a speedy completion of the appointed work.
He sent moreover to the writer of this history
an eloquent admonition, a copy of which I think
it well to insert in the present work, in order to
convey a just idea of his pious diligence and
zeal. To express, then, his displeasure at the
evil practices which he had heard were usual in
the place just referred to, he addressed me in
the following terms.

-

CHAPTER LII.

Constantine's Letter to Eusebius concerning
Mambre.

"VICTOR CONSTANTINUs, MAXIMUs AUGUSTUs,
to Macarius, and the rest of the bishops in
Palestine."

"One benefit, and that of no ordinary impor
tance, has been conferred on us by my truly
pious mother-in-law," in
she has made
known to us by letter that abandoned folly of im
pious men which has hitherto escaped detection

that

in Constantine, has a curiously interesting, bearing at present theo
logical controversies in America, and England for that matter.
It
may be called the doctrine of the "eternal Christ," as over against
the doctrine of the "essential Christ," or that which seems to make
his existence begin with his incarnation - the "historical Christ."
He had historical existence from the beginning, both as the indwell
ing and as the objective, and one might venture to think that advo
cates of these two views could find a meeting-ground, or solution of
difficulty at least, in this phrase which represents him, who was in

while it is really to Macarius. On this ground the Eusebian author

by you : so that the criminal conduct thus over
looked may now through our means obtain fitting
correction and remedy, necessary though ardy.
For surely it is a grave impiety indeed, that holy
places should be defiled by the stain of unhal
lowed impurities.
What then is this, dearest
brethren, which, though it has eluded your
sagacity, she of whom I speak was impelled by
a pious sense of duty to disclose?

CHAPTER LIII.

That the Saviour appeared in this Place to
Abraham.

"SHE assures me, then, that the place which
takes its name from the oak of Mambre, where
we find that Abraham dwelt, is defiled by certain
of the slaves of superstition in every possible
way.
She declares that idols' which should be
utterly destroyed have been erected on the site
of that tree ; that an altar is near the spot; and
that impure sacrifices are continually performed.
Now since it is evident that these practices are
equally inconsistent with the character of our
times, and unworthy the sanctity of the place
itself, I wish your Gravities" to be informed that
the illustrious Count Acacius, our friend, has re
ceived instructions by letter from me, to the
effect that every idol which shall be found in
the place above-mentioned shall immediately
be consigned to the flames; that the altar be
utterly demolished ; and that if any one, after
this our mandate, shall be guilty of impiety of
any kind in this place, he shall be visited with
condign punishment. The place itself we have
directed to be adorned with an unpolluted struc
ture, I mean a church ; in order that it may
become a fitting place of assembly for holy men.
Meantime, should any breach of these our com
mands occur, it should be made known to our
clemency without the least delay by letters from
you, that we may direct the person detected to
be dealt with, as a transgressor of the law, in
the severest manner.
For you are not ignorant
that the Supreme God first appeared to Abra
ham, and conversed with him, in that place.
There it was that the observance of the Divine
law first began ; there first the Saviour himself,
with the two angels, vouchsafed to Abraham a
manifestation of his presence; there God first
appeared to men; there he gave promise to
Abraham concerning his future seed, and straight
way fulfilled that promise ; there he foretold that
he should be the father of a multitude of nations.

' [These objects of idolatrous worship were probably figures in
tended to represent the angels who .." appeared to Abraham. -
Bay.J. More probably they were some form of images obscenely
worshiped.

* Better "Reverences," and so throughout.

CONSTANTINE.

[III. 53.

For these reasons, it seems to me right that this
place should not only be kept pure through your
diligence from all defilement, but restored also to
its pristine sanctity; that nothing hereafter may
be done there except the performance of fitting
service to him who is the Almighty God, and our
Saviour, and Lord of all. And this service it is
incumbent on you to care for with due attention,
if your Gravities be willing (and of this I feel
confident) to gratify my wishes, which are espe
cially interested in the worship of God. May
he preserve you, beloved brethren "

CHAPTER LIV.

Destruction of Jaso/ Temples and Images every
where.

ALL these things the emperor diligently per
formed to the praise of the saving power of
Christ, and thus made it his constant aim to
glorify his Saviour God. On the other hand he
used every means to rebuke the superstitious
errors of the heathen.
Hence the entrances of
their temples in the several cities were left ex
posed to the weather, being stripped of their
doors at his command ; the tiling of others was
removed, and their roofs destroyed. From others
again the venerable statues of brass, of which
the superstition of antiquity had boasted for
a long series of years, were exposed to view in
all the public places of the imperial city: so
that here a Pythian, there a Sminthian Apollo,
excited the contempt of the beholder: while
the Delphic tripods were deposited in the hip
podrome and the Muses of Helicon in the palace
itself.
In short, the city which bore his name
was everywhere filled with brazen statues of the
most exquisite workmanship, which had been
dedicated in every province, and which the
deluded victims of superstition had long vainly
honored as gods with numberless victims and
burnt sacrifices, though now at length they learnt
to renounce their error, when the emperor held
up the very objects of their worship to be the
ridicule and sport of all beholders.
With regard
to those images which were of gold, he dealt

a royal road, plain and unobstructed to all.

CHAPTER LV.

Overthrow of an Idol Temple, and Abolition
of Licentious Practices, at Aphaca in Phoe
nicia.

THE emperor's next care was to kindle, as it
were, a brilliant torch, by the light of which he
directed his imperial gaze around, to see if any
hidden vestiges of error might still exist. And
as the keen-sighted eagle in its heavenward flight
is able to descry from its lofty height the most
distant objects on the earth, so did he, while
residing in the imperial palace of his own fair
city, discover as from a watch-tower a hidden
and fatal snare of souls in the province of Phoe
nicia.
This was a grove and temple, not situ
ated in the midst of any city, nor in any public
place, as for splendor of effect is generally the
case, but apart from the beaten and frequented
road, at Aphaca, on part of the summit of Mount
Lebanon, and dedicated to the foul demon known
by the name of Venus.
It was a school of
wickedness for all the votaries of impurity, and
such as destroyed their bodies with effeminacy.
Here men undeserving of the name forgot the .
dignity of their sex, and propitiated the demon
by their effeminate conduct; here too unlawful

with other horrible and infamous practices, were

evils remained unchecked by the presence of
any observer, since no one of fair character
ventured to visit such scenes.
These proceed
ings, however, could not escape the vigilance of
our august emperor, who, having himself in
spected them with characteristic forethought,
and judging that such a temple was unfit for the
light of heaven, gave orders that the building
with its offerings should be utterly destroyed.
Accordingly, in obedience to the imperial com
mand, these engines of an impure superstition
were immediately abolished, and the hand of
military force was made instrumental in purg
ing the place. And now those who had hereto
fore lived without restraint learned self-control
through the emperor's threat of punishment, as
likewise those superstitious Gentiles wise in their
own conceit, who now obtained experimental
proof of their own folly.

CHAPTER LVI.

Destruction of the Temple of Aesculapius at
Agae."
For since a wide-spread error of these pre
tenders to wisdom concerned the demon wor
shiped in Cilicia, whom thousands regarded
with reverence as the possessor of saving and
healing power, who sometimes appeared to those
who passed the night in his temple, sometimes
restored the diseased to health, though on the
contrary he was a destroyer of souls, who drew
his
easily deluded worshipers from the true
Saviour to involve them in impious error, the
emperor, consistently with his practice, and de
sire to advance the worship of him who is at
once a jealous God and the true Saviour, gave
directions that this temple also should be razed
to the ground.
In prompt obedience to this
command, a band of soldiers laid this building,
the admiration of noble philosophers, prostrate
in the dust, together with its unseen inmate,
neither demon nor god, but rather a deceiver
of souls, who had seduced mankind for so long
a time through various ages. And thus he who
had promised to others deliverance from misfor
tune and distress, could find no means for his
own security, any more than when, as is told in
myth, he was scorched by the lightning's stroke."
Our emperor's pious deeds, however, had in them
nothing fabulous or feigned ; but by virtue of
the manifested power of his Saviour, this temple
as well as others was so utterly overthrown, that
not a vestige of the former follies was left
behind.

CHAPTER LVII.

Asow the Gentises abandoned soo/ Worship, and
turned to the Knowledge of God.

HENCE it was that, of those who had been
the slaves of superstition, when they saw with
their own eyes the exposure of their delusion,
and beheld the actual ruin of the temples and
images in every place, some applied themselves
to the saving doctrine of Christ; while others,
though they declined to take this step, yet repro
bated the folly which they had received from
their fathers, and laughed to scorn what they
had so long been accustomed to regard as gods.
Indeed, what other feelings could possess their
minds, when they witnessed the thorough un
cleanness concealed beneath the fair exterior of
the objects of their worship P
Beneath this
were found either the bones of dead men or
dry skulls, fraudulently adorned by the arts of
magicians,' or filthy rags full of abominable im
purity, or a bundle of hay or stubble. On see
ing all these things heaped together within their
lifeless images, they denounced their fathers'
extreme folly and their own, especially when
neither in the secret recesses of the temples
nor in the statues themselves could any inmate
be found ; neither demon, nor utterer of oracles,
neither god nor prophet, as they had heretofore
supposed : nay, not even a dim and shadowy
phantom could be seen.
Accordingly, every
gloomy cavern, every hidden recess, afforded easy
access to the emperor's emissaries: the inacces
sible and secret chambers, the innermost shrines
of the temples, were trampled by the soldiers'
feet; and thus the mental blindness which had
prevailed for so many ages over the gentile
world became clearly apparent to the eyes of
all.

CHAPTER LVIII.

How he destroyed the Tempse of Venus at Heli
opolis, and built the First Church in that
City.

SUCH actions as I have described may well be
reckoned among the emperor's noblest achieve
ments, as also the wise arrangements which he
made respecting each particular province. We
may instance the Phoenician city Heliopolis, in
which those who dignify licentious pleasure with
a distinguishing title of honor, had permitted
their wives and daughters to commit shameless
fornication.
But now a new statute, breathing
the very spirit of modesty, proceeded from the
emperor, which peremptorily forbade the con

tinuance of former practices. And besides this,
he sent them also written exhortations, as though
he had been especially ordained by God for this
end, that he might instruct all men in the prin
ciples of chastity.
Hence, he disdained not to
communicate by letter even with these persons,
urging them to seek diligently the knowledge
of God.
At the same time he followed up his
words by corresponding deeds, and erected even
in this city a church of great size and magnifi
cence: so that an event unheard of before in
any age, now for the first time came to pass,
namely, that a city which had hitherto been
wholly given up to superstition now obtained
the privilege of a church of God, with presby
ters and deacons, and its people were placed
under the presiding care of a bishop conse
crated to the service of the supreme God. And
further, the emperor, being anxious that here
also as many as possible might be won to the
truth, bestowed abundant provision for the ne
cessities of the poor, desiring even thus to
invite them to seek the doctrines of salvation,
as though he were almost adopting the words of
him who said, "Whether in pretense, or in
truth, let Christ be preached.""

ruin of the good, prepared himself to combat

eventually become estranged from us. Accord
ingly, he kindled a furious controversy at Anti
och, and thereby involved the church in that
place in a series of tragic calamities, which had
well-nigh occasioned the total overthrow of the
city. The members of the Church were divided

were roused to such a pitch, that the contest

at the same time that he exhorted them to a
peaceable spirit by repeated letters, and in

excused their conduct in his subsequent letters,
alleging that he had himself heard the merits of

concord among the rest.
In these letters, he
cautioned them against any desire to claim the
ruler of another district," through whose inter
vention peace had been restored, as their own,
and exhorted them, consistently with the usage
of the Church, to choose him as their bishop,
whom the common Saviour of all should point
out as suited for the office.

through the favor of God, to register among his

able than gladly to acquiesce in the prosperity
of all men? Especially since the precepts of the
divine law prescribe a better direction to your
proposed intention, and we ourselves desire that
your judgment should be confirmed by proper
sanction."
It may be that you are surprised,
and at a loss to understand the meaning of this
introduction to my present address. The cause
of it I will not hesitate to explain without re
I confess, then, that on reading your

- records I perceived, by the highly eulogistic
testimony which they bear to Eusebius, bishop
of Caesarea, whom I have myself long well known
and esteemed for his learning and moderation,
that you are strongly attached to him, and de
sire to appropriate him as your own.
What
thoughts, then, do you suppose that I entertain
on this subject, desirous as I am to seek for and
act on the strict principles of right? What
anxiety do you imagine this desire of yours has
caused me? O holy faith, who givest us in our
Saviour's words and precepts a model, as it were,
of what our life should be, how hardly wouldst
thou thyself resist the sins of men, were it not
that thou refusest to subserve the purposes of
gain
In my own judgment, he whose first ob
ject is the maintenance of peace, seems to be
superior to Victory herself; and where a right
and honorable course lies open to one's choice,
surely no one would hesitate to adopt it.
I ask
then, brethren, why do we so decide as to in
flict an injury on others by our choice? Why
do we covet those objects which will destroy the
credit of our own reputation?
I myself highly
esteem the individual whom ye judge worthy of
your respect and affection: notwithstanding, it
cannot be right that those principles should be
entirely disregarded which should be authorita
tive and binding on all alike, so that each should
not be content with his own circumstances, and
all enjoy their proper privileges: nor can it be
right, in considering the claims of rival candi
dates, to suppose but that not one only, but
many, may appear worthy of comparison with
this person.
For as long as no violence or
harshness are suffered to disturb the dignities of
the church, they continue to be on an equal
footing, and worthy of the same consideration
everywhere.
Nor is it reasonable that an in
quiry into the qualifications of this one should
be made to the detriment of others; since the
judgment of all churches, whether reckoned of
greater or less importance in themselves, is
equally capable of receiving and maintaining the

ferior to another, if we will but boldly declare
the truth, in regard to that standard of practice
which is common to all.
If this be so, we must
say that you will be chargeable, not with retain
ing this prelate, but with wrongfully removing
him; your conduct will be characterized rather
by violence than justice; and whatever may be
generally thought by others, I dare clearly and
boldly affirm

ground of accusation against you, and will pro
voke factious disturbances of the most mischiev
ous kind ; for even timid flocks can show the
use and power of their teeth, when the watchful
care of their shepherd declines, and they find
themselves bereft of his accustomed guidance.
If this then be really so, if I am not deceived in
my judgment, let this, brethren, be your first
consideration, for many and important consid
erations will immediately present themselves,
whether, should you persist in your intention,
that mutual kindly feeling and affection which
should subsist among you will suffer no dimi
nution?
In the next place, remember that
he, who came among you for the purpose of
offering disinterested counsel," now enjoys the
reward which is due to him in the judgment of
heaven; for he has received no ordinary recom
pense in the high testimony you have borne to
his equitable conduct.
Lastly, in accordance
with your usual sound judgment, do ye exhibit
a becoming diligence in selecting the person of
whom you stand in need, carefully avoiding all
factious and tumultuous clamor; for such clamor
is always wrong, and from the collision of dis
cordant elements both sparks and flame will
arise.
I protest, as I desire to please God and
you, and to enjoy a happiness commensurate
with your kind wishes, that I love you, and the
quiet haven of your gentleness, now that you
have cast from you that which defiled," and re
ceived in its place at once sound morality and
concord, firmly planting in the vessel the sacred

turn one's ears and eyes from such a subject,
lest by a description of each particular evil, the
pure sincerity and freshness of one's own faith
be impaired. Why then do I still bear with
such abounding evil; especially since this pro
tracted clemency is the cause that some who
were sound are become tainted with this pesti
lent disease? Why not at once strike, as it were,
at the root of so great a mischief by a public
manifestation of displeasure?

CHAPTER LXV.

The Heretics are deprived of their Meeting
Alaces.

"FORASMUCH, then, as it is no longer possible
to bear with your pernicious errors, we give
warning by this present statute that none of you
henceforth presume to assemble yourselves to
gether.' We have directed, accordingly, that you
be deprived of all the houses in which you are
accustomed to hold your assemblies: and our
care in this respect extends so far as to forbid the
holding of your superstitious and senseless meet
ings, not in public merely, but in any private
house or place whatsoever.
Let those of you,
therefore, who are desirous of embracing the true
and pure religion, take the far better course of
entering the catholic Church, and uniting with
it in holy fellowship, whereby you will be ena
bled to arrive at the knowledge of the truth.
In
any case, the delusions of your perverted under
standings must entirely cease to mingle with
and mar the felicity of our present times: I
mean the impious and wretched double-minded
ness of heretics and schismatics.
For it is an
object worthy of that prosperity which we enjoy
through the favor of God, to endeavor to bring
back those who in time past were living in the
hope of future blessing, from all irregularity and
error to the right path, from darkness to light,
from vanity to truth, from death to salvation.
And in order that this remedy may be applied
with effectual power, we have commanded, as
before said, that you be positively deprived of
every gathering point for your superstitious
meetings, I mean all the houses of prayer, if
such be worthy of the name, which belong to

1 There is throughout this Life a curious repetition in the details
of action against heretics of precisely the same things which Chris
tians complained of as having been done to them. The idea of
toleration then seems to have been much as it was in pre-reformation
times, or, not to judge other times when there is a beam in our own
eye, as it is in America and England to-day, - the largest toleration
for every one who thinks as we do, and for the others a temporary
suspension of the rule to "judge, not," with an amended prayer,
"Lord, condemn them, for they know not what they do," and a
vigorous attempt to sorce the divine judgmcnt.

delay to the catholic Church ; that any other
places be confiscated to the public service, and
no facility whatever be left for any future gather

of your unlawful assemblies may presume to
appear in any public or private place.

CHAPTER LXVI.

Jłow on the

Discovery of Prohibited Books
among the Heretics, Many of them return to
the Catholic Church.

THUS were the lurking-places of the heretics
broken up by the emperor's command, and the
savage beasts they harbored (I mean the chief
authors of their impious doctrines) driven to
flight.
Of those whom they had deceived,

guising their real sentiments, crept secretly into

Others, however, there were, who voluntarily

and with real sincerity embraced a better hope.
Meantime the prelates of the several churches
continued to make strict inquiry, utterly reject

specious disguise of false pretenses, while those
who came with sincerity of purpose were proved

of those who stood charged with rank heresy:
those, however, who maintained no impious doc
trine, but had been separated from the one body
through the influence of schismatic advisers,
were received without difficulty or delay. Ac
cordingly, numbers thus revisited, as it were,
their own country after an absence in a foreign
land, and acknowledged the Church as a mother
from whom they had wandered long, and to
whom they now returned with joy and gladness.
Thus the members of the entire body became
united, and compacted in one harmonious whole;
and the one catholic Church, at unity with itself,
shone with full luster, while no heretical or
schismatic body anywhere continued to exist."
And the credit of having achieved this mighty
work our Heaven-protected emperor alone, of
all who had gone before him, was able to attrib
ute to himself.

* This famous "church unity," for which Constantine has been
blessed or execrated, as the case might be, in all the ages since, was
hardly more complete than modern unified churches where all the
members held different pet doctrines and are prepared to fight for
them to the bitter end.

BOOK IV.

CHAPTER I.

IIow he honored Many by Presents and Promo
tions.

WHILE thus variously engaged in promoting
the extension and glory of the Church of God,
and striving by every measure to commend the
Saviour's doctrine, the emperor was far from
neglecting secular affairs; but in this respect
also he was unwearied in bestowing benefits of
every kind and in quick succession on the peo
ple of every province. On the one hand he
manifested a paternal anxiety for the general
welfare of his subjects; on the other he would
distinguish individuals of his own acquaintance
with various marks of honor; conferring his
benefits in every instance in a truly noble spirit.
No one could request a favor from the emperor,
and fail of obtaining what he sought: no one ex
pected a boon from him, and found that expec
tation vain." Some received presents in money,
others in land ; some obtained the Praetorian
praefecture, others senatorial, others again con
sular rank: many were appointed provincial
governors: others were made counts of the
first, second, or third order: in numberless in
stances the title of Most Illustrious, and many
other distinctions were conferred ; for the em
peror devised new dignities, that he might invest
a larger number with the tokens of his favor.

CHAPTER II.

Remission of a Fourth Part of the 7axes.

THE extent to which he studied the general
happiness and prosperity may be understood
from a single instance, most beneficial and uni
versal in its application, and still gratefully re
membered. He remitted a fourth part of the
yearly tribute paid for land, and bestowed it on
the owners of the soil; so that if we compute
this yearly reduction, we shall find that the cul
tivators enjoyed their produce free of tribute
every fourth year."
This privilege being estab
lished by law, and secured for the time to come,

this conduct from those who viewed it from another point of view.

* For directly contrary account of his taxations, compare Pro

has given occasion for the emperor's beneficence
to be held, not merely by the then present gen
eration, but by their children and descendants,
in perpetual remembrance.

CHAPTER III.

Aqualization of the More Oppressive Taxes.

AND whereas some persons found fault with
the surveys of land which had been made under
former emperors, and complained that their
property was unduly burdened; acting in this
case also on the principles of justice, he sent
commissioners to equalize the tribute, and to
secure immunity to those who had made this
appeal.

CHAPTER IV.

Asis Ziberality, from his Private Resources, to

means, in some cases lands, in other money, on

care that the loser, as having appeared in his
presence, should be as well satisfied as the gainer
of the cause ; for he considered that no one
ought in any case to retire dejected and sorrow
ful from an interview with such a prince." Thus
it happened that both parties returned from the
scene of trial with glad and cheerful counte
nances, while the emperor's noble-minded liber
ality excited universal admiration.

subjugated the Scythian' and Sarmatian tribes,
which had never learned submission, and com
pelled them, how unwilling soever, to own the
sovereignty of Rome? For the emperors who
preceded him had actually rendered tribute to
the Scythians: and Romans, by an annual pay
ment, had confessed themselves servants to bar
barians; an indignity which our emperor could
no longer bear, nor think it consistent with his
victorious career to continue the payment his
predecessors had made.
Accordingly, with full
confidence in his Saviour's aid, he raised his
conquering standard against these enemies also,
and soon reduced them all to obedience; coerc
ing by military force those who fiercely resisted
his authority, while, on the other hand, he con
ciliated the rest by wisely conducted embassies,
and reclaimed them to a state of order and civ
ilization from their lawless and savage life. Thus
the Scythians at length learned to acknowledge
subjection to the power of Rome.

CHAPTER VI.

Conquest of the Sarmatians, consequent on the
Rebellion of their Slaves.

WITH respect to the Sarmatians, God him
self brought them beneath the rule of Constan
tine, and subdued a nation swelling with barbaric
pride in the following manner.
Being attacked
by the Scythians, they had entrusted their slaves
with arms, in order to repel the enemy. These
slaves first overcame the invaders, and then,
their masters,
turning their weapons against
drove them all from their native land. The
expelled Sarmatians found that their only hope
of safety was in Constantine's protection: and
he, whose familiar habit it was to save men's
lives, received them all within the confines of
the Roman empire.' Those who were capable
of serving he incorporated with his own troops:
to the rest he allotted lands to cultivate for their
own support: so that they themselves acknowl
edged that their past misfortune had produced
a happy result, in that they now enjoyed Roman
liberty in place of savage barbarism.
In this
manner God added to his dominions many and
various barbaric tribes.

So that I myself have

stature prodigious : some of a red complexion,
others white as snow, others again of an inter

them in so munificent a manner as at once to
enrich those who bore them.
He also honored
the noblest among them with Roman offices

preferred to continue their residence among us,
and felt no desire to revisit their native land.

THE king of the Persians also having testified
a desire to form an alliance with Constantine,
by sending an embassy and presents as assur
ances of peace and friendship, the emperor, in
negotiating this treaty, far surpassed the mon
arch who had first done him honor, in the mag
nificence with which he acknowledged his gifts.

How the Zealous Prayers of Constantine oro
cured Peace to the Christians.

THUS, the nations of the world being every
where guided in their course as it were by the
skill of a single pilot, and acquiescing in the
administration of him who governed, as the ser
vant of God, the peace of the Roman empire
continued undisturbed, and all classes of his
subjects enjoyed a life of tranquillity and repose.
At the same time the emperor, who was con
vinced that the prayers of godly men contributed
powerfully to the maintenance of the public wel
fare, felt himself constrained zealously to seek
such prayers, and not only himself implored the
help and favor of God, but charged the prelates
of the churches to offer supplications on his
behalf.

CHAPTER XV.

Ase

causes

himself to be represented on his
Coins, and in his Portraits, in the Affifude

How deeply his soul was impressed by the
power of divine faith may be understood from
the circumstance that he directed his likeness
to be stamped on the golden coin of the em
pire with the eyes uplifted as in the posture of
prayer to God: and this money became current
throughout the Roman world.
His portrait also
at full length was placed over the entrance
gates of the palaces in some cities, the eyes
upraised to heaven, and the hands outspread
as if in prayer.

engaged in prayer to God.
At the same time
he forbade, by an express enactment, the setting
up of any resemblance of himself in any idol
temple, that not even the mere lineaments of
his person might receive contamination from
the error of forbidden superstition.

CHAPTER XVII.

Of his Prayers in the Palace, and his Reading
the Holy Scriptures.

Still nobler proofs of his piety might be dis
cerned by those who marked how he modeled
as it were his very palace into a church of God,
and himself afforded a pattern of zeal to those
assembled therein : how he took the sacred
scriptures into his hands, and devoted himself
to the study of those divinely inspired oracles;
after which he would offer up regular prayers
with all the members of his imperial court.

CHAPTER XVIII.

Ase enjoins the General Observance of the Lord's
Day, and the Day of Preparation.

HE ordained, too, that one day should be
regarded as a special occasion for prayer: I
mean that which is truly the first and chief of
all, the day of our Lord and Saviour. The
entire care of his household was entrusted to
deacons and other ministers consecrated to the
service of God, and distinguished by gravity of
life and every other virtue: while his trusty
body guard, strong in affection and fidelity to
his person, found in their emperor an instructor
in the practice of piety, and like him held the
Lord's salutary day in honor, and performed on
that day the devotions which he loved. The
same observance was recommended by this
blessed prince to all classes of his subjects: his
earnest desire being gradually to lead all man
kind to the worship of God.
Accordingly he
enjoined on all the subjects of the Roman em
pire to observe the Lord's day, as a day of rest,
and also to honor the day which precedes the
Sabbath; in memory, I suppose, of what the
Saviour of mankind is recorded to have achieved
on that day.'
And since his desire was to
teach his whole army zealously to honor the
Saviour's day (which derives its name from light,
and from the sun)," he freely granted to those

doritus and Nicephorus. - Bag.]

CHAPTER XXII.

That he directed even his Pagan Soldiers to
Aray on the Lord's Day.
WITH regard to those who were as yet igno
rant of divine truth, he provided by a second
statute that they should appear on each Lord's
day on an open plain near the city, and there,
at a given signal, offer to God with one accord
a prayer which they had previously learnt. He
admonished them that their confidence should
not rest in their spears, or armor, or bodily
strength, but that they should acknowledge the
supreme God as the giver of every good, and
of victory itself; to whom they were bound to
offer their prayers with due regularity, uplifting
their hands toward heaven, and raising their
mental vision higher still to the King of heaven,
on whom they should call as the Author of vic
tory, their Preserver, Guardian, and Helper.
The emperor himself prescribed the prayer to
be used by all his troops, commanding them
to pronounce the following words in the Latin
tongue:

Such was the duty to be performed on Sunday
by his troops, and such the prayer they were
instructed to offer up to God.

This has been urged as ground for saying that
Constantine did not commit himself to Christianity until the end of
life, but it only shows his tact and care in treating the diverse ele
ments of his empire.

Of his Zeal in Prayer, and the Honor he paid
to the Feast of Easter.

THE emperor himself, as a sharer in the holy
mysteries of our religion, would seclude himself
daily at a stated hour in the innermost chambers
of his palace ; and there, in solitary converse
with his God, would kneel in humble supplica
tion, and entreat the blessings of which he stood
But especially at the salutary feast of

Easter, his religious diligence was redoubled;
he fulfilled as it were the duties of a hierophant
with every energy of his mind and body, and
outvied all others in the zealous celebration of
this feast. He changed, too, the holy night
vigil into a brightness like that of day, by caus
ing waxen tapers of great length to be lighted
throughout the city:
besides which, torches
everywhere diffused their light, so as to impart
to this mystic vigil a brilliant splendor beyond
that of day."
As soon as day itself returned, in
imitation of our Saviour's gracious acts, he
opened a liberal hand to his subjects of every
nation, province, and people, and lavished
abundant bounties on all.

CHAPTER XXIII.

Aow he forbade Idolatrous Worship, but honored
Martyrs and the Church Festivals.

SUCH were his sacred ministrations in the ser
vice of his God.
At the same time, his subjects,
both civil and military, throughout the empire,
found a barrier everywhere opposed against idol
worship, and every kind of sacrifice forbidden."
A statute was also passed, enjoining the due
observance of the Lord's day, and transmitted
to the governors of every province, who under
took, at the emperor's command, to respect the
days commemorative of martyrs, and duly to
honor the
seasons in the churches : *
and all these intentions were fulfilled to the
emperor's entire satisfaction.

HENCE it was not without reason that once, on
the occasion of his entertaining a company of
bishops, he let fall the expression, "that he him
self too was a bishop," addressing them in my
hearing in
following words: "You are
bishops whose jurisdiction is within the Church :
I also am a bishop, ordained by God to over
look whatever is external to the Church."
And
truly his measures corresponded with his words;
for he watched over his subjects with an epis
copal care, and exhorted them as far as in him
lay to follow a godly life.

CHAPTER XXV.

Prohibition of Sacrifices, of Mystic Rises, Com

CONSISTENTLY with this zeal he issued succes
sive laws and ordinances, forbidding any to offer
sacrifice to idols, to consult diviners, to erect
images, or to pollute the cities with the sanguin
ary combats of gladiators.' And inasmuch as
the Egyptians, especially those of Alexandria,
had been accustomed to honor their river
through a priesthood composed of effeminate
men, a further law was passed commanding the
extermination of the whole class as vicious,
that no one might thenceforward be found
tainted with the like impurity. And whereas
the superstitious inhabitants apprehended that
the river would in consequence withhold its
customary flood, God himself showed his ap
proval of the emperor's law by ordering all
things in a manner quite contrary to their ex
pectation.
For those who had defiled the cities
by their vicious conduct were indeed seen no
more ; but the river, as if the country through
which it flowed had been purified to receive it,
rose higher than ever before, and completely
overflowed
fertilizing
streams: thus effectually admonishing the de

So numerous, indeed, were the benefits of this
kind conferred by the emperor on every prov
ince, as to afford ample materials to any who
might desire to record them. Among these
may be instanced those laws which he entirely
remodelled, and established on a more equitable
basis: the nature of which reform may be briefly
and easily explained. The childless were pun
ished under the old law with the forfeiture of
their hereditary property, a merciless statute,
which dealt with them as positive criminals.
The emperor annulled this, and decreed that
those so circumstanced should

But nature herself denies chil

by bodily infirmity.
Others continue childless,

What then?
Should this conduct be deemed worthy of pun
ishment, or rather of admiration and praise;
since to desire this state is in itself honorable,
and to maintain it surpasses the power of un
assisted nature?
Surely those whose bodily
infirmity destroys their hope of offspring are
worthy of pity, not of punishment: and he who
devotes himself to a higher object calls not for
chastisement, but especial admiration. On such
principles of sound reason did the emperor
rectify the defects of this law.
Again, with
regard to the wills of dying persons, the old
laws had ordained that they should be expressed,
even at the latest breath, as it were, in certain
definite words, and had prescribed the exact
form and terms to be employed.
This prac
tice had occasioned many fraudulent attempts
to hinder the intentions of the deceased from

chastity and

holiness.

[The word "philosophy," here and in the 28th chapter, plainly
indicates that virginity . was so highly honored in the earlier
ages of Christianity, and the undue exaltation of which was produc
tive, necessarily, of evils which it is scarcely possible to estimate at
their full extent. - Rag.]... On the growing prevalence of the prac

being carried into full effect.
As soon as our
emperor was aware of these abuses, he reformed
this law likewise, declaring that a dying man
ought to be permitted to indicate his last wishes
in as few words as possible, and in whatever
terms he pleased ; and to set forth his will in
any written form ; or even by word of mouth,
provided it were done in the presence of proper
witnesses, who might be competent faithfully to
discharge their trust.

CHAPTER XXVII.

Among Other Enactments, he decrees that no
Christian shall slave to a Jew, and affirms
the Validity of the Decisions of Counci/s.

HE also passed a law to the effect that no
Christian should remain in servitude to a Jewish
master, on the ground that it could not be right
that those whom the Saviour had ransomed
should be subjected to the yoke of slavery by
a people who had slain the prophets and the
Lord himself.
If any were found hereafter in
these circumstances, the slave was to be set at
liberty, and the master punished by a fine.

He likewise added the sanction of his author
ity to the decisions of bishops passed at their
synods, and forbade the provincial governors to
annul any of their decrees: for he rated the
priests of God at a higher value than any judge
whatever. These and a thousand similar pro
visions did he enact for the benefit of his sub
jects; but there is not time now to give a special
description of them, such as might convey an
accurate idea of his imperial wisdom in these
respects: nor need I now relate at length, how,
as a devoted servant of the Supreme God, he
employed himself from morning until night in
seeking objects for his beneficence, and how
equally and universally kind he was to all.

some cases he granted lands, in others he issued

evinced much care and forethought in fully pro
viding the naked and destitute with clothing.
He distinguished, however, with most special
honor those who had devoted their lives to the
practice of Divine philosophy.
Hence his re

holy and ever virgin choir : for he felt assured

that the God to whom such persons devoted
themselves was himself an inmate of their souls.

CHAPTER XXIX.

Of Constantine's Discourses and Declamations."

For himself, he sometimes passed sleepless
nights in furnishing his mind with Divine knowl
edge : and much of his time was spent in com
posing discourses, many of which he delivered
in public; for he conceived it to be incumbent
on him to govern his subjects by appealing to
their reason, and to secure in all respects a ra
tional obedience to his authority.
Hence he
would sometimes himself evoke an assembly, on
which occasions vast multitudes attended, in
the hope of hearing an emperor sustain the part
of a philosopher. And if in the course of his
speech any occasion offered of touching on
sacred topics, he immediately stood erect, and
with a grave aspect and subdued tone of voice
seemed reverently to be initiating his auditors
in the mysteries of the Divine doctrine: and
when they greeted him with shouts of acclama
tion, he would direct them by his gestures to
raise their eyes to heaven, and reserve their
admiration for the Supreme King alone, and
honor him with adoration and praise. He
usually divided the subjects of his address, first
thoroughly exposing the error of polytheism,
and proving the superstition of the Gentiles to
be mere fraud, and a cloak for impiety. He
then would assert the sole sovereignty of God:
passing thence to his Providence, both general
and particular.
Proceeding next to the dispen
sation of salvation, he would demonstrate its
necessity, and adaptation to the nature of the
case; entering next in order on the doctrine of
the Divine judgment." And here especially he
appealed most powerfully to the consciences of
his hearers, while he denounced the rapacious

while he testified against them in the clearest
and most impressive terms that they would have

He reminded them that God himself had given

had intrusted to their government; but that all

Then
drawing the dimensions of a human figure with

he continued : "Though thou couldst obtain

inclined to clemency, and none of the provin

small degree of blame on the general adminis

ONE act, however, I must by no means omit
to record, which this admirable prince per
formed in my own presence. On one occasion,
emboldened by the confident assurance I enter
tained of his piety, I had begged permission to
pronounce a discourse on the subject of our
Saviour's sepulchre in his hearing.
With this
request he most readily complied, and in the
midst of a large number of auditors, in the in
terior of the palace itself, he stood and listened
with the rest.
I entreated him, but in vain, to
seat himself on the imperial throne which stood
near : he continued with
attention to
weigh the topics of my discourse, and gave his
own testimony to the truth of the theological
doctrines it contained.
After some time had
passed, the oration being of considerable length,
I was myself desirous of concluding ; but this
he would not permit, and exhorted me to pro
ceed to the very end. On my again entreating
him to sit, he in his turn was displeased and
said that it was not right to listen in a careless
manner to the discussion of doctrines relating
to God; and again, that this posture was good
and profitable to himself, since it was reverent to
stand while listening to sacred truths.
Having,
therefore, concluded my discourse, I returned
home, and resumed my usual occupations.

with what pleasure we receive favors of this

us more frequently with those compositions, to

so that I am urging a willing man, as they say,
in exhorting you to your customary pursuits.

we entertain is a proof that the person who has

is in no respect incompetent to the task, impos

Such was
his letter on this subject: and that which related
to the providing of copies of the Scriptures for
reading in the churches was to the following

therefore, highly requisite, since that city is

of this letter, to use two of the public carriages

SUCH were the emperor's commands, which
were followed by the immediate execution of
the work itself, which we sent him in magnifi
cent and elaborately bound volumes of a three
fold and fourfold form."
This fact is attested
by another letter, which the emperor wrote in
acknowledgment, in which, having heard that
the city Constantia in our country, the inhabi
tants of which had been more than commonly
devoted to superstition, had been impelled by
a sense of religion to abandon their past idola
try, he testified his joy, and approval of their
conduct.

1 Molz, in a note regards these as lectionaries, but they are usu
ally thought to have been regular copies of the Scriptures in Greek
- Septuagint and N. T., and the Codex Sinaiticus has been thought
to be one of them.
It dates from not earlier than the time of Euse
bius, as it contains the Eusebian Canons, but, yet from the fourth
century.
Altogether it is not impossible that it was one of these,
and at all events a description of it, extracted from Scriveners (/ntroduction, 1883, p. 88 sq.), will be a fair illustration.
"13% inches
in length by 14% inches high." "Beautiful vellum." "Each page
comprises four columns, with 48 lines in each column." "Contin
uous noble uncials." "Arranged in quires of four or three sheets."
It is evident from comparison of several quotations of Eusebius that
the copy of the New Testament which he himself used was not
closely related with the Sinaitic text, unless the various readings
headed by this M.S. are all mistakes originating with it. Compare
allusions in the notes to such different readings. The last clause,
although in the text of Heinichen, is of doubtful authority.

mitted their innumerable idols to the flames,
and adopted in their stead the principles of the

inces, both in the cities and the country, became

God; destroyed as worthless things the images
of every kind which they had heretofore held
most sacred; voluntarily demolished the lofty
temples and shrines which contained them ; and,
renouncing their former sentiments, or rather
errors, commenced and completed entirely new
churches.
But since it is not so much my prov
ince to give a circumstantial detail of the actions
of this pious prince, as it is theirs who have been
privileged to enjoy his society at all times, I shall
content myself with briefly recording such facts
as have come to my own personal knowledge,
before I proceed to notice the last days of his
life.

CHAPTER XL.

Zhat having conferred the Dignity of Caesars on
/his Zhree Sons at the Three Decennia/ Periods
of his Reign, he dedicated the Church at
Jerusalem.

By this time the thirtieth year of his reign was
completed.
In the course of this period, his
three sons had been admitted at different times
as his colleagues in the empire. The first, Con
stantinus, who bore his father's name, obtained
this distinction about the tenth year of his reign.
Constantius, the second son, so called from his
grandfather, was proclaimed Caesar about the

Zhat in the mean/ime he ordered a Council fo
be convened as Zyre, because of Controversies
raised in Egypt.
MEANwhile that spirit of envy which is the
enemy of all good, like a dark cloud intercept
ing the sun's brightest rays, endeavored to mar
the joy of this festivity, by again raising conten
tions to disturb the tranquillity of the Egyptian
churches. Our divinely favored emperor, how
ever, once more convened a synod composed
of many bishops, and set them as it were in
armed array, like the host of God, against this
malignant spirit, having commanded their pres
ence from the whole of Egypt and Libya, from
Asia, and from Europe, in order, first, to decide
the questions in dispute, and afterwards to per
form the dedication of the sacred edifice above
mentioned. He enjoined them, by the way, to
adjust their differences at the capital city of
Phoenicia, reminding them that they had no
right, while harboring feelings of mutual ani
mosity, to engage in the service of God, since
those who are at
his law expressly forbids
variance to offer their gift until they have first
become reconciled and mutually disposed to
peace.
Such were the salutary precepts which
the emperor continually kept vividly before his
own mind, and in accordance with which he
admonished them to undertake their present
duties in a spirit of perfect unanimity and con
cord, in a letter to the following purport.

"Surely it would best consist with and best
become the prosperity of these our times, that
the Catholic Church should be undivided, and
the servants of Christ be at this present moment
clear from all reproach.
Since, however, there
are those who, carried away by a baleful and
furious spirit of contention (for I will not charge
them with intentionally leading a life unworthy
of their profession), are endeavoring to create
that general confusion which, in my judgment,
is the most pernicious of all evils; I exhort you,
forward as you already are, to meet together
and form a synod without delay: to defend
those who need protection; to administer reme
dies to your brethren who are in peril; to recall
the divided members to unity of judgment; to
rectify errors while opportunity is yet allowed:
that thus you may restore to so many provinces
that due measure of concord which, strange and
sad anomaly
the arrogance of a few individuals
has destroyed. And I believed that all are alike
persuaded that this course is at the same time
pleasing to Almighty God (as well as the highest
object of my own desires), and will bring no
small honor to yourselves, should you be suc
cessful in restoring peace.
Delay not, then,
but hasten with redoubled zeal to terminate the
present dissensions in a manner becoming the
occasion, by assembling together in that spirit
of true sincerity and faith which the Saviour
whom we serve especially demands from us, I
may almost say with an audible voice, on all
occasions. No proof of pious zeal on my part
shall be wanting.
Already have I done all to
which my attention was directed by your letters.
I have sent to those bishops whose presence
you desired, that they may share your counsels.
I have despatched Dionysius, a man of consular
rank, who will both remind those prelates of
their duty who are bound to attend the Council
with you, and will himself be there to superin
tend the proceedings, but especially to main
tain good order.

No sooner had these injunctions been carried
into effect, than another emissary arrived with
despatches from the emperor, and an urgent
admonition to the Council to hasten their jour
ney to Jerusalem without delay."
Accordingly
they all took their departure from the province
of Phoenicia, and proceeded to their destination,
availing themselves of the public means of trans
port.
Thus Jerusalem became the gathering
point for distinguished prelates from every prov
ince, and the whole city was thronged by a
vast assemblage of the servants of God. The
Macedonians had sent the bishop of their me
tropolis; *
the Pannonians and Moesians the
fairest of God's youthful flock among them.
A holy prelate from Persia too was there, deeply
versed in the sacred oracles; while Bithynian
and Thracian bishops graced the Council with
their presence; nor were the most illustrious
from Cilicia wanting, nor the chief of the Cap
padocians, distinguished above all for learning
and eloquence.
In short, the whole of Syria
and Mesopotamia, Phoenicia and Arabia, Pales
tine, Egypt, and Libya, with the dwellers in the
Thebaid, all contributed to swell the mighty
concourse of God's ministers, followed as they
were by vast numbers from every province.
They were attended by an imperial escort," and
officers of trust had also been sent from the pal

He also distributed lavish supplies of money

and the multitudes of both sexes who suffered
from want of food and the common necessaries

Finally, he enriched and beautified the

CHAPTER XLV.

Various Discourses by the Assembled Bishops;
also by Eusebius, the Writer of this History.

MEANTIME the festival derived additional luster
both from the prayers and discourses of the min
isters of God, some of whom extolled the pious
emperor's willing devotion to the Saviour of man
kind, and dilated on the magnificence of the edi
fice which he had raised to his memory. Others
afforded, as it were, an intellectual feast to the
ears of all present, by public disquisitions on
the sacred doctrines of our religion.
Others in
terpreted passages of holy Scripture, and un
folded their hidden meaning; while such as
were unequal to these efforts presented a blood
less sacrifice and mystical service to God in the
prayers which they offered for general peace, for
the Church of God, for the emperor himself as
the instrumental cause of so many blessings, and
for his pious sons.
I myself too, unworthy as I
was of such a privilege, pronounced various pub
lic orations in honor of this solemnity, wherein
I partly explained by a written description the
details of the imperial edifice, and partly en

Thus joyfully was the festival of dedication
celebrated in the thirtieth year of our emperor's
reign.

That the Council at Micaea was held in the

summoned at the famous Bithynian city.
That
indeed was a triumphal assembly, held in the
twentieth year of his reign, an occasion of
thanksgiving for victory over his enemies in the

present meeting added luster to the thirtieth

as a peace-offering to God, the giver of all good.

also appointing men of approved piety to be

At the same time he assigned
them the most accomplished teachers of secular
learning, by some of whom they were taught
the arts of war, while they were trained by
others in political, and by others again in legal
science. To each moreover was granted a truly
royal retinue, consisting of infantry, spearmen,
and body guards, with every other kind of mili
tary force; commanded respectively by captains,
tribunes, and generals," of whose warlike skill
and devotion to his sons the emperor had had
previous experience.

Embassy and Presents from the Indians.

ABOUT this time ambassadors from the Indians,
who inhabit the distant regions of the East, ar
rived with presents consisting of many varieties
of brilliant precious stones, and animals differ
ing in species from those known to us.
These
offerings they presented to the emperor, thus
allowing that his sovereignty extended even to
the Indian Ocean, and that the princes of their
country, who rendered homage to him both by
paintings and statues, acknowledged his imperial
and paramount authority.
Thus the Eastern
Indians now submitted to his sway, as the
Britons of the Western Ocean had done at the
commencement of his reign.

That Constantine divided the Empire between

Politics and Religion.

HAviNG thus established his power in the
opposite extremities of the world, he divided
the whole extent of his dominions, as though
he were allotting a patrimonial inheritance to
the dearest objects of his regard, among his
three sons.
To the eldest he assigned his
grandfather's portion; to the second, the em
pire of the East; to the third, the countries
which lie between these two divisions." And
being desirous of furnishing his children with
an inheritance truly valuable and salutary to
their souls, he had been careful to imbue them

ancient patrimony of their father, for the more opulent, but less
martial, countries of the East.
Italy, the Western Illyricum, and
Africa, were accustomed to revere Constans, the third of his sons,
as the representative of the great Constantine" (Gibbon, Decline
and Fall, ch. 18). - Bag.] Compare Prolegomena, under Life.

CHAPTER LII.

That after they had reached Man's Estate he
was their Guide in Piety.

As long as the Caesars were of tender years,
they were aided by suitable advisers in the man
agement of public affairs; but on their arrival
at the age of manhood their father's instructions
alone sufficed. When present he proposed to
them his own example, and admonished them
to follow his pious course : in their absence he
furnished them by letter with rules of conduct
suited to their imperial station, the first and
greatest of which was an exhortation to value
the knowledge and worship of the Sovereign
Lord of all more than wealth, nay, more than
empire itself.
At length he permitted them to
direct the public administration of the empire
without control, making it his first request that
they would care for the interests of the Church
of God, and boldly profess themselves disciples
of Christ. Thus trained, and excited to obe
dience not so much by precept as by their own
voluntary desire for virtue, his sons more than
fulfilled the admonitions of their father, devot
ing their earnest attention to the service of God,
and observing the ordinances of the Church even
in the palace itself, with all the members of their
households."
For their father's forethought had
provided that all the attendants of his sons
should be Christians. And not only so, but the
military officers of highest rank, and those who
had the control of public business, were profes
sors of the same faith : for the emperor placed
confidence in the fidelity of men devoted to the
service of God, as in a strong and sure defense.
When our thrice blessed prince had completed
these arrangements, and thus secured order and
tranquillity throughout the empire, God, the dis
penser of all blessings, judged it to be the fitting

CHAPTER LIII.

Asaving reigned about Thirty-two Years, and
/ived above Sixty, he still had a Sound Body.

HE completed the time of his reign in two
and thirty years, wanting a few months and
days,' and his whole life extended to about
twice that period. At this age he still possessed
a sound and vigorous body, free from all blem
ish, and of more than youthful vivacity; a noble
mien, and strength equal to any exertion; so
that he was able to join in martial exercises, to
ride, endure the fatigues of travel, engage in
battle, and erect trophies over his conquered
enemies, besides gaining those bloodless victories
by which he was wont to triumph over those
who opposed him."

Of those who abused his Extreme Benevolence
for Avarice and Hypocrisy.

IN like manner his mental' qualities reached
the highest point of human perfection.
Indeed
he was distinguished by every excellence of
character, but especially by benevolence ; a
virtue, however, which subjected him to censure
from many, in consequence of the baseness of
wicked men, who ascribed their own crimes to
the emperor's forbearance.
In truth I can my
self bear testimony to the grievous evils which
prevailed during these times; I mean the vio
lence of rapacious and unprincipled men, who
preyed on all classes of society alike, and the
scandalous hypocrisy of those who crept into
the Church, and assumed the name and charac

goodness of heart, the genuineness of his own
faith, and his truthfulness of character, induced
the emperor to credit the profession of these
reputed Christians, who craftily preserved the
semblance of sincere affection for his person.
The confidence he reposed in such men some
times forced him into conduct unworthy of him
self, of which envy took advantage to cloud in
this respect the luster of his character."

CHAPTER LVIII.,

Concerning the Building of a Church in Honor
of the Apostles at Constantinopse.

AFTER this he proceeded to erect a church in
memory of the apostles, in the city which bears
his name.
This building he carried to a vast
height, and brilliantly decorated by encasing it
from the foundation to the roof with marble
slabs of various colors. He also formed the
inner roof of finely fretted work, and overlaid it
throughout with gold. The external covering,
which protected the building from the rain, was
of brass instead of tiles; and this too was splen
didly and profusely adorned with gold, and re
flected the sun's rays with a brilliancy which
dazzled the distant beholder. The dome was
entirely encompassed by a finely carved tracery,
wrought in brass and gold.

SUCH was the magnificence with which the
emperor was pleased to beautify this church.

"...From this point to the end of the first sentence in ch. 58 is

The building was surrounded by an open area
of great extent, the four sides of which were ter
minated by porticos which enclosed the area
and the church itself.
Adjoining these porticos
were ranges of stately chambers, with baths and
promenades, and besides
many apartments
adapted to the use of those who had charge of
the place.

IIe also erected his own Sepulchral Monument
in this Church.

All these edifices the emperor consecrated
with the desire of perpetuating the memory of
the apostles of our Saviour. He had, however,
another object in erecting this building: an
object at first unknown, but which afterwards
became evident to all. He had in fact made
choice of this spot in the prospect of his own
death, anticipating with extraordinary fervor of
faith that his body would share their title with
the apostles themselves, and that he should thus

* [These words seem to prove that the emperor now first became
a catechumen.
His postponement of baptism until his last illness
(after having stood forward so long as the public advocate and pro
tector of the Christian religion), and the superstitious reliance which
he was encouraged to place on the late o: of this "myste
rious " rite, afford an evidence of the melancholy obscuration of
Christian truth at the very time when Christianity was ostensibly
becoming the religion of the Roman Empire.
There is probably too
much truth in the following remarks of Gibbon: "The pride of
Constantine, who refused the privileges of a catechurnen, cannot
easily be explained or excused: but the delay of his baptism may be
justified by the maxims and practice of ecclesiastical antiquity. *.
sacrament of baptism was supposed to contain a full and absolute
expiation of sin; and the soul was instantly restored to its original
purity, and entitled to the promise of eternal salvation. Among the
proselytes of Christianity, there were many who judged it imprudent
to precipitate a salutary rite, which could not be repeated; to throw
away an inestimable privilege, which could never be recovered," &c.
(Decline and Fall, ch. 20). - Bag.] On the forms of admission to

for it to have any weight in view of the overwhelming documentary

After he had thus spoken, the prelates performed
the sacred ceremonies in the usual manner, and,
having given him the necessary instructions,
made him a partaker of the mystic ordinance.

strain of thanksgiving to God; after which he
added these words. "Now I know that I am

counted worthy of immortality, and am made a

his compassion for the unhappy condition of
those who were strangers to such blessings as he
enjoyed : and when the tribunes and generals

yet be prolonged, he assured them in reply that
he was now in possession of true life; that none
but himself could know the value of the bless
ings he had received ; so that he was anxious
rather to hasten than to defer his departure to
God.
He then proceeded to complete the
needful arrangement of his affairs, bequeathing
an annual donation to the Roman inhabitants
of his imperial city; apportioning the inheri
tance of the empire, like a patrimonial estate,
among his own children; in short, making every
disposition according to his own pleasure."

The idea of ownership in empire which seems so strange in
these days of republics, and is disallowed even by theoretical monarch
ists, seems to have been a most matter-of-course one in the mind
of Constantine, and Eusebius was a true imperialist regarding "tyr

Let us now
attend to the circumstances which followed this

event.

CHAPTER LXV.

Lamentations of the Soldiery and their Officers.

IMMEDIATELY the assembled spearmen and
body-guard rent their garments, and prostrated
themselves on the ground, striking their heads,
and uttering lamentations and cries of sorrow,
calling on their imperial lord and master, or
rather, like true children, on their father, while
their tribunes and centurions addressed him as
their preserver, protector, and benefactor. The
rest of the soldiery also came in respectful order
to mourn as a flock the removal of their good
shepherd.
The people meanwhile ran wildly
throughout the city, some expressing the inward
sorrow of their hearts by loud cries, others ap
pearing confounded with grief: each mourning
the event as a calamity which had befallen him
self, and bewailing his death as though they felt
themselves bereft of a blessing common alike
to all.

position in the principal chamber of the imperial
palace, and surrounded by candles burning in
candlesticks of gold, presenting a marvelous
spectacle, and such as no one under the light
of the sun had ever seen on earth since the
world itself began.
For in the central apart
ment of the imperial palace, the body of the
emperor lay in its elevated resting-place, arrayed
in the symbols of sovereignty, the diadem and
purple robe, and encircled by a numerous retinue
of attendants, who watched around it incessantly
night and day.

CHAPTER LXVII.

He received the same Honors from the Counts
and other Officers as before his Death.

THE military officers, too, of the highest rank,
the counts, and the whole order of magistrates,
who had been accustomed to do obeisance to
their emperor before, continued to fulfill this
duty without any change, even after his death
entering the chamber at the appointed times,
and saluting their coffined sovereign with bended

by multitudes of every rank, who came with
their wives and children to witness the spectacle.
These honors continued to be rendered for a
considerable time, the soldiers having resolved
thus to guard the body until his sons should
arrive, and take on themselves the conduct of
their father's funeral. No mortal had ever, like
this blessed prince, continued to reign even
after death, and to receive the same homage as
during his life: he only, of all who have ever
lived, obtained this reward from God : a suitable
reward, since he alone of all sovereigns had in all
his actions honored the Supreme God and his
Christ, and God himself accordingly was pleased
that even his mortal remains should still retain
imperial authority among men; thus indicating
to all who were not utterly devoid of under
standing the immortal and endless empire which
his soul was destined to enjoy.

course of events here.

As soon, however,

Mourning for Constantine at Rome; and the
Aonor paid him there through Paintings after
his Death.

ON the arrival of the news of the emperor's
death in the imperial city, the Roman senate
and people felt the announcement as the heav
iest and most afflictive of all calamities, and
gave themselves up to an excess of grief. The
baths and markets were closed, the
public
spectacles, and all other recreations in which

Nor
was their sorrow expressed only in words: they
proceeded also to honor him, by the dedication
of paintings to his memory, with the same re
spect as before his death. The design of these
pictures embodied a representation of heaven
itself, and depicted the emperor reposing in an
ethereal
vault.

his father's funeral in the city which bears his
name, himself heading the procession, which
was preceded by detachments of soldiers in
military array, and followed by vast multitudes,
the body itself being surrounded by companies
of spearmen and heavy armed infantry. On the
arrival of the procession at the church dedicated
to the apostles of our Saviour, the coffin was
there entombed.
Such honor did the youthful
emperor Constantius render to his deceased
parent, both by his presence, and by the due
performance of this sacred ceremony.

CHAPTER LXXI.

Sacred Service in the Church of the Apostles on
the Occasion of Constantine's Funeral.

As soon as [Constantius] had withdrawn him
self with the military train, the ministers of God
came forward, with the multitude and the whole
congregation of the faithful, and performed the
rites of Divine worship with prayer.
At the
same time the tribute of their praises was given
to the character of this blessed prince, whose
body rested on a lofty and conspicuous monu
ment, and the whole multitude united with the
priests of God in offering prayers for his soul, not
without tears, - nay, rather with much weeping;
thus performing an office consonant with the
desires of the pious deceased."
In this respect
also the favor of God was manifested to his
servant, in that he not only bequeathed the
succession of the empire to his own beloved
sons, but that the earthly tabernacle of his
thrice blessed soul, according to his own earnest
wish, was permitted to share the monument of
the apostles; was associated with the honor of
their name, and with that of the people of God;
was honored by the performance of the sacred
ordinances and mystic service; and enjoyed a
participation in the prayers of the saints. Thus,
too, he continued to possess imperial power
even after death, controlling, as though with ren
ovated life, a universal dominion, and retaining
in his own name, as Victor, Maximus, Augus
tus, the sovereignty of the Roman world."

Church ; having alone abolished utterly the error
of polytheism, and discountenanced idolatry in

life and after death, was he accounted worthy of

THE EMPEROR CONSTANTINE,

Which HE ADDRESSED

CHAPTER I.

Preliminary Remarks on the Feast of Easter:

By his Beneficiaries.

But principles quite opposed to

have agreed in withholding his rightful worship

Nor was this error
unaccompanied by violence and cruelty, espe
cially in that the will of princes encouraged the

itself led the way in the career of reckless folly.
Such principles as these, confirmed by the prac

CHAPTER II.

An Appeal to the Church and to his Hearers to
pardon and correct the Errors of his Speech.

HEAR then, thou master' of the ship, possessor
of virgin purity, and thou Church, the cherisher
of tender and inexperienced age, guardian of
truth and gentleness, through whose perennial
fountain the stream" of salvation flows |
Be ye
also indulgent, my hearers, who worship God
sincerely, and are, therefore, the objects of his
care: attending, not to the language, but to the
truth of what is said ; not to him who speaks,
but rather to the pious zeal which hallows his
discourse !
For what will be the use of words
when the real purpose of the speaker remains
unknown? It may be, indeed, that I essay
great things; the love of God which animates
my soul, a love which overpowers natural re
serve, is my plea for the bold attempt. On you,
then, I call, who are best instructed in the mys
teries of God, to aid me with your counsel, to
follow me with your thoughts, and correct what
ever shall savor of error in my words, expecting
no display of perfect knowledge, but graciously
accepting the sincerity of my endeavor. And
may the Spirit of the Father and the Son accord
his mighty aid, while I utter the words which
he shall suggest to speech or thought."
For if
any one, whether in the practice of eloquence,
or any other art, expects to produce a finished
work without the help of God, both the author
and his efforts will be found alike imperfect;
while he has no cause to fear, no room for dis
couragement," who has once been blessed with
the inspiration of Heaven.
Wherefore asking
your indulgence for the length of this preface,
let us attempt the theme in its utmost scope."

Creator of a// Things; and that Materia/

But he who proceeds from him is again united
to him; and this separation from and union with
him is not local, but intellectual in its character.
For this generation was accompanied by no dimi
nution of the Father's substance (as in the case
of generation by seed); but by the determining
act of foreknowledge God manifested a Saviour
presiding over * this sensible world, and all cre
ated things therein." From hence, then, is the
source of existence and life to all things which
are within the compass of this world ; hence
proceed the soul, and every sense;" hence those
organs through which the sense-perceptions are
perfected.
What, then, is the object of this
argument? To prove that there is One director
of all things that exist, and that all things,
whether in heaven or on earth, both natural and
organized bodies," are subject to his single sov
ereignty.
For if the dominion of these things,
numberless as they are, were in the hands, not
of one but of many, there must be a partition
and distribution of the elements, and the old
fables would be true;" jealousy, too, and ambi
tion, striving for superior power, would destroy
the harmonious concord of the whole, while
each of the many masters would regulate in a
manner different from the rest the portion sub
ject to his control. The fact, however, that this
universal order is ever one and the same, is the
proof that it
is under the care of a superior
power, and that its origin cannot be ascribed to
chance.
Else how could the author of universal
nature ever be known P. To whom first, or last,
could prayers and supplications be addressed ?
Whom could I choose' as the object of my wor
ship, without being guilty of impiety towards
the rest?
Again, if haply I desired to obtain
some temporal blessing, should I not, while
expressing my gratitude to the Power who fav
ored my request, convey a reproach to him who
opposed it? Or to whom should I pray, when
desiring to know the cause of my calamity, and
to obtain deliverance? Or let us suppose that
the answer is given by oracles and prophecies,

would prove destructive to the interests of earth:
the orderly alternation of times and seasons
would disappear; the successive productions of
the earth would be enjoyed no more : the day
itself, and the repose of night which follows it,
would cease to be.
But enough on this subject:
let us once more resume that species of reason
ing which admits of no reply.

CHAPTER IV.

On the Error of Idolatrous Worship.

WHATEveR has had a beginning, has also an
end. Now that which is a beginning in respect
of time, is called a generation: and whatever is
by generation is subject to corruption, and its
beauty' is impaired by the lapse of time.
How,
then, can they whose origin is from corruptible
generation, be immortal?
Again, this supposi
tion has gained credit with the ignorant multi
tude, that marriages, and the birth of children,
are usual among the gods.
Granting, then, such
offspring to be immortal, and continually pro
duced, the race must of necessity multiply to
excess : and if this were so, where is the heaven,
or the earth, which could contain so vast and
still increasing a multitude of gods?
But what
shall we say of those men who represent these
celestial beings as joined in incestuous union
with their sister goddesses, and charge them
with adultery and impurity?" We declare,
further, with all confidence, that the very honors
and worship which these deities receive from
men are accompanied by acts of wantonness
and profligacy. Once more ; the experienced
and skillful sculptor, having formed the concep
tion of his design, perfects his work according
to the rules of art; and in a little while, as if
forgetful of himself, idolizes his own creation,
and adores it as an immortal god, while yet he

Being, who is seen by the mental eye, and con
ceived by the intellect alone, requires to be

But the honors of which we speak are given to
those who have yielded to the power of death:
they once were men, and tenants, while they
lived, of a mortal body.

These may be here, as is often the case, simple synonyms, but both
words are used in the same phrase later in such way as to suggest
that ruxn is parallel with "fate." rather than "chance" in the
author's mind.
avròu arov seems to be used of "self-originating,"
ruxn of originating from some unknown cause or without any cause.
The former is the modern, self-energized, " list-yourselves-by-your

Aristotle. (Metaph. Io. 8) defines chance (rwyn) as a "cause by

substantially what Janet (Fina/ Causes, 1878, p. 19) means by defin

But, granting that the varied results of actions,
whether right or erroneous in themselves, de

general principle of justice," the principle of ren
dering to every one his due, be ascribed to fate?'
Or how can it be said that laws, encouragements
to virtue and dissuasives from what is evil, praise,
blame, punishment, in short whatever operates
as a motive to virtue, and deters from the prac
tice of vice, derive their origin from fortune or
accident, and not rather from that of justice,"
which is a characteristic attribute of the God of
providence? For the events which befall men are

clear and manifest to our sight, they appear in a
still stronger light, when we collect, and as it
were concentrate our thoughts within ourselves,
and ponder their causes with deep attention.

fire and wind, water and air, the succession of
the seasons, the recurrence of summer and win

that this opinion has a semblance of reason in
regard to earthly and corruptible things (though
Nature herself supplies every good with a lavish
hand); yet can we believe that things which are
immortal and unchangeable are the inventions
of men? These, indeed, and all things else
which are beyond the reach of our senses, and
comprehended by the intellect" alone, receive
their being, not from the material life of man,
but from the intellectual and eternal essence of
God.
Again, the orderly arrangement of these
things is the work of his providence : for in

sun, is bright; that night succeeds his setting,
and the starry host" by which night itself is
redeemed from total darkness.

approach to him? Do not these things mani

of the solar rays which ripens the fruits of the

show by what shape or form this chance is char

CHAPTER VII.

In regard to Zhings above our Comprehension,
we should glorify the Creator's Wisdom, and
attribuse their Causes to him alone, and not
to Chance.

IN fact, this word "chance" is the expression
of men who think in haphazard and illogical
fashion; who are unable to understand the
causes of these things, and who, owing to the
feebleness of their own apprehensions, conceive
that those things for which they cannot assign a
reason, are ordered without reason. There are,
unquestionably, some things which possess won
derful natural properties, and the full apprehen
sion of which is very difficult: for example, the
nature of hot springs.
For no one can easily
explain the cause of so powerful a fire; and it
is indeed surprising that though surrounded on
all sides by a body of cold water, it loses none
of its native heat.
These phenomena appear to
be of rare occurrence throughout the world,
being intended, I am persuaded, to afford to
mankind convincing evidence of the power of
that Providence which ordains that two directly
opposite natures, heat and cold, should thus pro
ceed from the self-same source. Many indeed,
yea, numberless, are the gifts which God has
bestowed for the comfort and enjoyment of man;
and of these the fruit of the olive-tree and the
vine deserve especial notice ; the one for its
power of renovating and cheering the soul," the
other because it ministers to our enjoyment, and
is likewise adapted for the cure of bodily disease.
Marvelous, too, is the course of rivers, flowing
night and day with unceasing motion, and pre
senting a type of ever-flowing, never-ceasing life:
and equally wonderful is the alternate succession
of day and night.

CHAPTER VIII.

That God bestows an Abundant Supply of what
ever is suited to the Wants of Man, and min
issers but sparingly to his Peasures; in Both
Cases with a View to his Advantage.

LET what has been said suffice to prove that
nothing exists without reason and intelligence,
and that reason itself and providence are of
God.
It is he who has also distributed the
metals, as gold, silver, copper, and the rest, in
due proportion; ordaining an abundant supply
of those which would be most needed and gen
erally employed, while he dispensed those which
serve the purposes merely of pleasure in adorn
ment of luxury with a liberal and yet a sparing
hand, holding a mean between parsimony and
profusion.
For the searchers for metals, were
those which are employed for ornament pro
cured in equal abundance with the rest, would
be impelled by avarice to despise and neglect to
gather those which, like iron or copper, are ser
viceable for husbandry, or house-building, or the
equipment of ships; and would care for those
only which conduce to luxury and a superfluous
excess of wealth.
Hence it is, as they say, that
the search for gold and silver is far more diffi
cult and laborious than that for any other metals,
the violence of the toil thus acting as a counter
poise to the violence of the desire.
And how
many instances might still further be enumerated
of the workings of that Divine Providence which,
in all the gifts which it has so unsparingly con
ferred upon us, plainly urges us to the practice
of self-control and all other virtues, and leads
us away from unbefitting covetousness
To trace
the secret reasons of all these things is indeed a
task which exceeds the power of human faculties.

able being arrive at the knowledge of perfect
truth, or apprehend in its purity the counsel of
God from the beginning?

of the universe, and evidently supreme: while
the second, as the obedient agent of his com

as the cause.
In accordance, therefore, with
the soundest reason, we may say that there is
one Being whose care and providence are over
all things, even God the Word, who has ordered
all things; but the Word being God himself is
also the Son of God.
For by what name can
we designate him except by this title of the
Son, without
into the most grievous
error?
For the Father of all things is properly
considered the Father of his own Word. Thus
far, then, Plato's sentiments were sound ; but in
what follows he appears to have wandered from
the truth, in that he introduces a plurality of
gods, to each of whom he assigns specific
forms. And this has given occasion to still
greater error among the unthinking portion of

mankind, who pay no regard to the providence
of the Supreme God, but worship images of their
own devising, made in the likeness of men or
other living beings. Hence it appears that the
transcendent nature and admirable learning of
this philosopher, tinged as they were with such
errors as these, were by no means free from im
purity and alloy. And yet he seems to me to
retract, and correct his own words, when he
plainly declares that a rational soul is the breath"
of God, and divides all things into two classes,
intellectual and sensible : [the one simple, the
other] ‘ consisting of bodily structure; the one
comprehended by the intellect alone, the other
estimated by the judgment and the senses. The
former class, therefore, which partakes of the
divine spirit, and is uncompounded and imma
terial, is eternal, and inherits everlasting life;
but the latter, being entirely resolved into the
elements of which it is composed, has no share
in everlasting life. He farther teaches the ad
mirable doctrine, that those who have passed a
life of virtue, that is, the spirits of good and
holy men, are enshrined, after their separation
from the body, in the fairest mansions of heaven.
A doctrine not merely to be admired, but profit
able too."
For who can believe in such a state
ment, and aspire to such a happy lot, without
desiring to practice righteousness and temper
ance, and to turn aside from vice?
Consistently
with this doctrine he represents the spirits of
the wicked as tossed like wreckage on the streams
of Acheron and Pyriphlegethon.

nay, they even treat them with contempt and

ing to the "all things" which he divides into intellectual and sen
sible, making the intellectual as well as the sensible to have bodily
(somatic) structure. "All things," or "the universe," a plural
technical term, is regarded as his mind passes to the explanation as
" the all.". This psychological probability appears a simpler solu
tion than the various textual conjectures.

barbarous' countries ring with exploded and
false tales.
For the poets assert that the judg
ment of souls after death is committed to men
whose parentage they ascribe to the gods," ex
tolling their righteousness and impartiality and
represent them as guardians of the dead. The
same poets describe the battles of the gods and
certain usages of war among them, and speak
of them as subject to the power of fate. Some
of these deities they picture
to us as cruel,
others as strangers to all care for the human
race, and others again as hateful in their char
acter. They introduce them also as mourning
the slaughter of their own children, thus imply
ing their inability to succor, not strangers merely,
but those most dear to them.
They describe
them, too, as subject to human passions, and
sing of their battles and wounds, their joys and
sorrows. And in all this they appear worthy
of belief."
For if we suppose them to be
moved by a divine impulse to attempt the poetic
art, we are bound to believe them and to be
persuaded of what they utter under this inspira
tion. They speak, then, of the calamities to
which their divinities are subject; calamities
which of course are altogether true !
But it
will be objected that it is the privilege of poets
to lie, since the peculiar province of poetry is to
charm" the spirits of the hearers, while the very
essence of truth is that things told be in reality
exactly what they are said to be."
Let us grant
that it is a characteristic of poetry occasionally
to conceal the truth.
But they who speak false
hood do it not without an object; being in
fluenced either by a desire of personal gain or
advantage, or possibly, being conscious of some
evil conduct, they are induced to disguise the
truth by dread of the threatening vengeance of

"Truth lies in the fiction, however, when what is told corresponds
to reality." Mr. Warner, in his lecture, goes on to say that the ob
ject of fiction is to reveal what is, - not the base and sordid things
only or peculiarly, but the best possibilities, and gives an exquisite
exposition of the fact that the idealism of true fiction is simply the
realism of the nobler characteristics and truths. The truth is, that
the object of fiction or poetry as art is to produce the image, - fill
the . personality with a picture. This is only gained in its
highest form when every detail exactly corresponds to truth or
reality. The function of fiction is not illusion, but realization.
Its
object is the reproduction of truth.

WHOEveR, then, has pursued a course un
worthy of a life of virtue, and is conscious of
having lived an irregular and disorderly life, let
him repent, and turn with enlightened spiritual
vision to God; and let him abandon his past
career of wickedness, content if he attain to
wisdom even in his declining years. We, how
ever, have received no aid from human instruc
tion; nay, whatever graces of character
are
esteemed of good report by those who have
understanding, are entirely the gift of God.
And I am able to oppose no feeble buckler
against the deadly weapons of Satan's armory;
I mean the knowledge I possess of those
things which are pleasing to him : and of these
I will select such as are appropriate to my pres

of the Father of all.
But do thou, O Christ,
Saviour of mankind, be present to aid me in
my hallowed task |
Direct the words which

and whose aim is rather applause than sound
argument, is distasteful to hearers of sound
judgment.
It is asserted, then, by some pro
fane and senseless persons, that Christ, whom we
worship, was justly condemned to death, and that
he who is the author of life to all, was himself
deprived of life. That such an assertion should
be made by those who have once dared to enter
the paths of impiety, who have cast aside all
fear, and all thought of concealing their own
depravity, is not surprising.
But it is beyond
the bounds of folly itself that they should be
able, as it seems, really to persuade themselves
that the incorruptible God yielded to the vio
lence of men, and not rather to that love alone
which he bore to the human race : that they
should fail to perceive that divine magnanimity
and forbearance is changed by no insult, is
moved from its intrinsic steadfastness by no
revilings; but is ever the same, breaking down
and repelling, by the spirit of wisdom and great

company of the wisest among men," and or
dained that most noble and useful doctrine,
which is calculated to lead the good and blessed
of mankind to an imitation of his own provi
dential care. And what higher blessing can we
speak of than this, that God should prescribe
the way of righteousness, and make those who
are counted worthy of his instruction like him
self; that goodness might be communicated to
all classes of mankind, and eternal felicity be
the result? This is the glorious victory: this
the true power: this the mighty work, worthy
of its author, the restoration of all people to
soundness of mind: and the glory of this tri
umph we joyfully ascribe to thee, thou Saviour
of all !
But thou, vile and wretched blasphemy,
whose glory is in lies and rumors and calumny;
thy power is to deceive and prevail with the
inexperience of youth, and with men who still
retain the folly of youth. These thou seducest
from the service of the true God, and settest up
false idols as the objects of their worship and
their prayers; and thus the reward of their folly
awaits thy deluded victims: for they calumniate
Christ, the author of every blessing, who is God,
and the Son of God.
Is not the worship of the
best and wisest of the nations of this world
worthily directed to that God, who, while pos
sessing boundless power, remains immovably
true to his own purpose, and retains undimin
ished his characteristic kindness and love to
man? Away, then, ye impious, for still ye may
while vengeance on your transgressions is yet
withheld ; begone to your sacrifices, your feasts,
your scenes of revelry and drunkenness, wherein,
under the semblance of religion, your hearts are
devoted to profligate enjoyment, and pretending
to perform sacrifices, yourselves are the willing
slaves of your own pleasures. No knowledge
have ye of any good, nor even of the first com
mandment of the mighty God, who both de
clares his will to man, and gives commission to
his Son to direct the course of human life, that
they who have passed a career of virtue and self
control may obtain, according to the judgment
of that Son, a second, yea, a blessed and happy
existence."
I have now declared the decree of
God respecting the life which he prescribes to
man, neither ignorantly, as many have done, nor

mercy to a ruined world. - Bag.] Were it in our province to criti
cise the critic, we might notice that the fear of the Lord is the begin

just conception of wisdom or true learning says the same thing.
The man who knows that God and not buo is or ruxn manages the
universe, is more learned than the wisest of those learned in things
which are not so.

Whence this generation of which
we speak, if God be indeed only One, and inca

to consider generation as of two kinds; one in
the way of natural birth, which is known to all;
the other, that which is the effect of an eternal
cause, the mode of which is seen by the pre
science of God, and by those among men whom
he loves.
For he who is wise will recognize the
cause which regulates the harmony of creation.
Since, then, nothing exists without a cause, of
necessity the cause of existing substances pre
ceded their existence.
But since the world and
all things that it contains exist, and are pre
served," their preserver must have had a prior
existence; so that Christ is the cause of preser

conception which confuses Christ our Saviour with Christ our Re

Redemption was a necessary part of his effort for our sal
vation, but the salvation itself was a saving, in literal English pre
serving. We have been redeemed; we are being saved.

• Bar follows here Valesius' translation and note where he
makes the word "preservation " a conjectural emendation of Scali
er, inconsistent with the meaning of the passage, and omits trans
ating "the cause of all things that exist."
But Hern. does not even
hint such reading, and his text (followed also by Mo/z.), so far from
tending to disturb the whole meaning, gives much the more intelli
gent conception.
Christ is the preserver (saviour) of things. Pres
ervation of things is the effect of that cause, just as the Father is
the cause of the Son, and the Son the effect of that cause. Therefore
the preserver precedes created things as a cause precedes its effect.

yielded a swift and unhindered assent to the
prayers of men, to whose welfare, indeed, his
whole life was devoted without reserve.
His
doctrines instilled, not prudence only," but real
wisdom: his hearers were instructed, not in the
mere social virtues," but in the ways which con
duct to the spiritual world ; and devoted them
selves to the contemplation of immutable and
eternal things, and the knowledge of the Supreme
Father. The benefits which he bestowed were

This form of the story, according to
which the Holy Spirit descends in the form of a dove, is according
to Walesius from the Apochrypha; perhaps, he suggests, from the
"Gospel to the Hebrews." In later art the dove is the constant
symbol of the Holy Spirit, and is often found in pictures of the
annunciation, e.g. in pictures by Simeone Memmi, Dürer, Andrea
del Sarto, and many others.

whose hearts inclined to thee to desire earnestly
a divine and blessed life, and hast provided that,
like merchants of true blessings, they might im
part to many others the wisdom and good for
tune they had received ; themselves, meanwhile,
reaping the everlasting fruit of virtue.
Freed
from the trammels of vice, and imbued with the
love of their fellow-men, they keep mercy ever
before their eyes, and hoping for the promises
of faith;" devoted to modesty, and all those
virtues which the past career of human life had
thrown aside [but which were now restored by
him whose providence is over all]." No other
power could be found to devise a remedy for
such evils, and for that spirit of injustice which
had heretofore asserted its dominion over the
race of men.
Providence, however, could reach
the circumstances even here, and with ease re
stored whatever had been disordered by violence
and the licentiousness of human passion. And
this restoring power he exercised without con
cealment.
For he knew that, though there
were some whose thoughts were able to recog
nize and understand his power, others there
were whose brutish and senseless nature led them
to rely exclusively on the testimony of their own
senses.
In open day, therefore, that no one,
whether good or evil, might find room for doubt,
he manifested his blessed and wondrous heal
ing power; restoring the dead to life again, and
renewing with a word the powers of those who
had been bereft of bodily sense." Can we, in
short, suppose, that to render the sea firm as
the solid ground, to still the raging of the storm,
and finally to ascend to heaven, after turning the
unbelief of men to steadfast faith by the per
formance of these wondrous acts, demanded less
than almighty power, was less than the work of
God? Nor was the time of his passion unac
companied by like wonders: when the sun was
darkened, and the shades of night obscured the
light of day. Then terror everywhere laid hold
upon the people, and the thought that the end
of all things was already come, and that chaos,
such as had been ere the order of creation began,
would once more prevail.
Then, too, the cause
was sought of so terrible an evil, and in what
respect the trespasses of men had provoked the
wrath of Heaven; until God himself, who sur
veyed with calm dignity the arrogance of the
face of heaven, and
ungodly, renewed the

fellow-men," and so on in picturesque variety, and yet as appropri
ate as it is lacking in uniformity.

that boldness in the prospect of death which
springs from pure faith and genuine holiness
before God. He who is thus armed can with

its use for martyrs is not uncommon (cf. Ambrose, ad Gratian, c. 2).
Later the term was used of all, especially faithful professors of Christ.

knowing full well that it is God who gives the
power both to endure, and to fulfill with ready
zeal the Divine commands. And well may such
a course as this receive the meed of never-failing
remembrance and everlasting honor.
For as
the martyr's life is one of sobriety and obedience
to the will of God, so is his death an example
of true greatness and generous fortitude of soul.
Hence it is followed by hymns and psalms,
words and songs of praise to the all-seeing God:
and a sacrifice of thanksgiving is offered in
memory of such men, a bloodless, a harmless
sacrifice, wherein is no need of the fragrant
frankincense, no need of fire; but only enough
of pure light* to suffice the assembled worship
ers. Many, too, there are whose charitable spirit
leads them to prepare a temperate banquet for
the comfort of the needy, and the relief of those

THERE are, indeed, some who venture with
childish presumption to find fault with God in
respect of this also, and ask why it is that he
has not created one and the same natural dis
position for all, but rather has ordained the
existence of many things different, nay, contrary
in their nature, whence arises the dissimilarity
of our moral conduct and character. Would it
not (say they) have been better, both as regards
obedience to the commands of God, and a just
apprehension of himself, and for the confirma
tion of individual faith, that all mankind should
be of the same moral character?
It is indeed
ridiculous to expect that this could be the case,
and to forget that the constitution of the world
is different from that of the things that are in
the world; that physical and moral objects are
not identical in their nature, nor the affections
of the body the same as those of the soul.
[For
the immortal soul far exceeds the material world

in dignity, and is more blessed than the perish
able and terrestrial creation, in proportion as it
is noble and more allied to God."]
Nor is the
human race excluded from participation in the
divine goodness; though this is not the lot of
all indiscriminately, but of those only who search
deeply into the Divine nature, and propose the
knowledge of sacred things as the leading object
of their lives.

CHAPTER XIV.

That Created Mature differs infinite/y from Un

SURELY it must be the very height of folly to
compare created with eternal things, which latter
have neither beginning nor end, while
the
former, having been originated and called into
being, and having received a commencement
of their existence at some definite time, must
consequently, of necessity have an end. How
then can things which have thus been made,
bear comparison with him who has ordained
their being? Were this the case, the power
to command their existence could not rightly
be attributed to him. Nor can celestial things
be compared to him, any more than the mate
rial" with the intellectual" world, or copies with
the models from which they are formed.
Nay,
is it not absurd thus to confound all things, and
to obscure the honor of God by comparing
him with men, or even with beasts? And is it
not characteristic of madmen, utterly estranged
from .a life of sobriety and virtue, to affect a
power equivalent to that of God? If indeed
we in any sense aspire to blessedness like that
of God, our duty is to lead a life according to
his commandments: so shall we, having finished
a course consistent with the laws which he has
prescribed, dwell for ever superior to the power
of fate, in eternal and undecaying mansions.
For the only power in man which can be ele
vated to a comparison with that of God, is
sincere and guileless service and devotion of
heart to himself, with the contemplation and
study of whatever pleases him, the raising our
affections above the things of earth, and direct

Unless, indeed, we will
deceive ourselves, and remain in wretched igno
rance of the fact, that for our advantage, that is,
to secure the blessing of the human race, he
went about upon earth; and, having called
around him the best men of their age, com
mitted to them instructions full of profit, and of
power to preserve them in the path of a virtu
ous life; teaching them the faith and righteous
ness which are the true remedy against the ad
verse power of that malignant spirit whose
delight it is to ensnare and delude the inexperi
enced. Accordingly he visited the sick, relieved
the infirm from the ills which afflicted them, and
consoled those who felt the extremity of penury
and want.
He commended also sound and
rational sobriety of character, enjoining his fol
lowers to endure, with dignity and patience,
every kind of injury and contempt: teaching
them to regard such as visitations permitted by
their Father, and the victory is ever theirs who
nobly bear the evils which befall them.

bined with that philosophy which is nothing
else than the knowledge of truth and goodness,
producing in men the generous habit of sharing

they have themselves acquired by honorable
means.
At the same time he utterly forbade
all proud oppression, declaring that, as he had
come to associate with the lowly, so those who
despised the lowly would be excluded from his
favor.
Such and so great was the test whereby
he proved the faith of those who owned alle

prepared them for the contempt of danger and

terror, but taught them at the same time the
most genuine confidence in himself.
Once,
too, his rebuke was uttered to restrain the zeal
of one of his companions, who yielded too easily
to the impulse of passion, when he assaulted
with the sword, and, eager to protect his Sav
iour's life, exposed his own. Then it was that
he bade him desist, and returned his sword to its
sheath, reproving him for his distrust of refuge
and safety in himself, and declaring solemnly that
all who should essay to retaliate an injury by like
aggression, or use the sword, should perish by a
violent death." This is indeed heavenly wisdom,
to choose rather to endure than to inflict injury,
and to be ready, should necessity so require, to
suffer, but not to do, wrong.
For since injuri
ous conduct is in itself a most serious evil, it is
not the injured party, but the injuring, on whom
the heaviest punishment must fall.
It is indeed
possible for one who is subject to the will of
God to avoid the evil both of committing and
of suffering injury, provided his confidence be
firm in the protection of that God whose aid is
ever present to shield his servants from harm.
For how should that man who trusts in God
attempt to seek for resources in himself?
In
such a case he must abide the conflict with un
certainty of victory: and no man of understand
ing could prefer a doubtful to a certain issue.
Again, how can that man doubt the presence
and aid of God, who has had experience of
manifold dangers, and has at all times been
easily delivered, at his simple nod, from all
terrors: who has passed, as it were, through
the sea which was leveled by the Saviour's
word, and afforded a solid road for the passage
of the people?
This is, I believe, the sure basis
of faith, the true foundation of confidence, that
we find such miracles as these performed and
perfected at the command of the God of Provi
dence.
Hence it is that even in the midst of
trial we find no cause to repent of our faith, but
retain an unshaken hope in God; and when
this habit of confidence is established in the
soul, God himself dwells in the inmost thoughts.
But he is of invincible power: the soul, there
fore, which has within it him who is thus invin
cible, will not be overcome by the perils which
may surround it.
Likewise," we learn this truth
from the victory of God himself, who, while in
tent on providing for the blessing of mankind,
though grievously insulted by the malice of the
ungodly, yet passed unharmed through the suf
ferings of his passion, and gained a mighty con
quest, an everlasting crown of triumph, over all

and ways of righteousness, should be destroyed,
and the whole world partake of the virtues of
wisdom and sound discretion, through the almost

victims, and the pollutions of an accursed wor

laws of Assyria and Egypt, the lives of innocent
men were offered up in images of brass or earth.

the Divine command, the land of the once

proved victorious over numerous and mighty
nations, an army strong in defenses and in
arms), not by the flight of arrows or the hurl

who, after reducing to order an unruly nation,
and disciplining their minds' to habits of obe
dience and respect, out of captivity restored
them to a state of freedom, turned their mourn
ing into gladness, and so far elevated their minds,"
that, through the excess of contrast with their
former circumstances, and the abundance of
their prosperity, the spirit of the people was
elated with haughtiness and pride? So far did
he surpass in wisdom those who had lived before
him, that even the wise men and philosophers *
who are extolled by heathen nations aspired to
imitate his wisdom.
For Pythagoras, following
his wisdom, attained to such a pitch of self
control, that he became to Plato, himself a
model of discretion, the standard of his own
self-mastery.
Again, how great and terrible
the cruelty of that ancient Syrian king, over
whom Daniel triumphed, the prophet who un
folded the secrets of futurity, whose actions
evinced transcendent greatness of soul, and the
luster of whose character and life shone con
spicuous above all? The name of this tyrant
was Nebuchadnezzar, whose race afterward be
came extinct, and his vast and mighty power
was transferred to Persian hands. The wealth
of this tyrant was then, and is even now, cele
brated far and wide, as well as his ill-timed
devotion to unlawful worship, his idol statues,
lifting their heads to heaven, and formed of
various metals, and the terrible and savage laws
ordained to uphold this worship.
These terrors
Daniel, sustained by genuine piety towards the
true God, utterly despised, and predicted that
the tyrant's unseasonable zeal would be produc
tive of fearful evil to himself. He failed, how
ever, to convince the tyrant (for excessive wealth
is an effectual barrier to true soundness of judg
ment), and at length the monarch displayed the
savage cruelty of his character, by commanding
that the righteous prophet should be exposed to
the fury of wild beasts.
Noble, too, indeed was
the united spirit exhibited by those brethren "
(whose example others have since followed, and

which has befallen these cities.
Memphis lies desolate; that city
which was the pride of the once mighty Pharaoh whose power
Moses crushed at the Divine command." This has been changed
to accord with the text and punctuation of Heinichen. The change
makes Constantine declare himself an eye-witness of the fate of
Memphis alone, which is thought to accord with the facts;
for
while he was in fact in Egypt with Diocletian, there is no evidence
that he ever saw Babylon. And yet it is possible he did.

* The sage commentators on this passage have thought it incum

"wise men or philosophers, - whichever you choose to call them "
(Pal. and Hein.), Colloquially speaking, there is a vast difference
between being a philosopher and being a wise man.

Saviour's name)," those, I mean, who stood un
harmed in the fiery furnace, and the terrors
appointed to devour them, repelling by the
holy touch of their bodies the flame by which
they were surrounded.
On the overthrow of
the Assyrian Empire, which was destroyed by
thunderbolts from Heaven," the providence of
God conducted Daniel to the court of Cambyses
the Persian king.
Yet envy followed him even
here; nor envy only, but the deadly plots of the
magians against his life, with a succession of
many and urgent dangers, from all which he
was easily delivered by the providential care of
Christ," and shone conspicuous in the practice
of every virtue. Three times in the day did he
present his prayers to God, and memorable were
the proofs of supernatural power which he dis
played; and hence the magians, filled with
envy at the very efficacy of his petitions, repre
sented the possession of such power to the king
as fraught with danger, and prevailed on him to
adjudge this distinguished benefactor of the
Persian people to be devoured by savage lions.
Daniel, therefore, thus condemned, was con
signed to the lions' den (not indeed to suffer
death, but to win unfading glory); and though
surrounded by these ferocious beasts of prey,
he found them more gentle than the men who
had enclosed him there.
Supported by the
power of calm and steadfast prayer, he was en
abled to subdue all these animals, ferocious as,
by nature, they were.
Cambyses, on learning
the event (for so mighty a proof of Divine
power could not possibly be concealed), amazed
at the marvelous story, and repenting the too
easy credence he had given to the slanderous
charges of the magians, resolved, notwithstand
ing, to be himself a witness of the spectacle.
But when he saw the prophet with uplifted
hands rendering praises to Christ, and the lions
crouching, and as it were worshiping, at his
feet, immediately he adjudged the magians, to
whose persuasions he had listened, to perish by
the self-same sentence, and shut them up in the
lions' den.'
The beasts, erewhile so gentle,
rushed at once upon their victims, and with all
the fierceness of their nature tore and destroyed
them all."

CHAPTER XVIII.

Of the Erythraean Sibyl, who pointed in a Pro
phetic Acrostic at our Lord and his Passion.
The Acrostic is "Jesus Christ, Son of God,
Saviour, Cross."

My desire, however, is to derive even from
foreign sources a testimony to the Divine nature
of Christ.
For on such testimony it is evident
that even those who blaspheme his name must
acknowledge that he is God, and the Son of
God if indeed they will accredit the words of
those whose sentiments coincided with their
own." The Erythraean Sibyl, then, who herself
assures us that she lived in the sixth generation
after the flood, was a priestess of Apollo, who
wore the sacred fillet in imitation of the God
she served, who guarded also the tripod encom
passed with the serpent's folds, and returned
prophetic answers to those who approached her
shrine; having been devoted by the folly of her
parents to this service, a service productive of
nothing good or noble, but only of indecent
fury, such as we find recorded in the case of
Daphne." On one occasion, however, having
rushed into the sanctuary of her vain supersti
tion, she became really filled with inspiration
from above, and declared in prophetic verses
the future purposes of God; plainly indicating
the advent of Jesus by the initial letters of these
verses, forming an acrostic
in these words:
JESUS CHRIST, SON OF GOD, SAVIOUR, CRoss.
The verses themselves are as follows:

Earth's oozing pores" shall mark the day;

Judgment!
Earth's heavenly king his glories shall display:
Sovereign of all, exalted on his throne,
Unnumbered multitudes their God shall own;
Shall see their Judge, with mingled joy and fear,
Crowned with his saints, in human form appear.
How vain, while desolate earth's glories lie,
Riches, and pomp, and man's idolatry !
In that dread hour, when Nature's fiery doom
Startles the slumb'ring tenants of the tomb,
Trembling all flesh shall stand; each secret wile,
Sins long forgotten, thoughts of guilt and guile,
Open beneath God's searching light shall lie:
No refuge then, but hopeless agony.
O'er heaven's expanse shall gathering shades of night
From earth, sun, stars, and moon, withdraw their light;
God's arm shall crush each mountain's towering pride;
On ocean's plain no more shall navies ride.
Dried at the source, no river's rushing sound
Shall soothe, no fountain slake the parched ground.
Around, afar, shall roll the trumpet's blast,
Voice of wrath long delayed, revealed at last.
In speechless awe, while earth's foundations groan,
On judgment's seat earth's kings their God shall own.

* "Eliminated them all."

Walesius calls attention to the char
acteristic slight inaccuracies of our author: e.g. in the Biblical ac
count (1) it was not the magi; (2) it was not Cambyses.

1 "Of their own selves."

Reviled by man, now owned by earth and heaven,
O'er every land extends his iron sway.
Such is the name these mystic lines display;
Saviour, eternal king, who bears our sins away."

It is evident that the virgin uttered these
verses under the influence of Divine inspiration.
And I cannot but esteem her blessed, whom
the Saviour thus selected to unfold his gracious
purpose towards us.

* [It can scarcely be necessary to observe that the acrostic, the
general sense of which has been aimed at in the above translation,
must be regarded as the pious fiction of some writer, whose object
was to recommend the truth of Christianity to heathens by an appeal
to the authority of an (alleged) ancient heathen prophecy. - }."
The quotation is sound in the edition of Alexandré, Bk. VIII. ch.
219-250.
(Cf. translation in Augustin, De civ. Dei.) The transla
tion of Bag., giving the "general sense" and reproducing the acros
tic, stands unchanged. The translation of 1709, much more vigorous
and suggestive of the ‘‘Dies Irae," is as follows:

"When the Great Day of Judgment shall appear,
The melting Earth shall then dissolve with fear;
A King Immortal shall from Heav'n descend,
At whose Tribunal the whole world attend.
Both Just and Wicked shall, when Time grows old,
Their mighty God in flesh array'd behold;
Armies o Saints on His Right hand shall come,
Whilst Humane Souls expect their final doom.
Th' Universe shall be a dry, Barren Strand,
And Thorns shall flourish on the scorched land;
Men shall with indignation cast awa
Their Wealth and Idols in that dol day.
The parching Earth, and Heaven in flames shall fry,
And searching fire drain the Ocean dry:
All flesh which in the Grave imprison'd lay,
Shake off their Fetters, and return to Day.
Fire 'twixt Good and Bad shall diff'rence make,
And filthy Dross from purer Metal take.
Man's secret Deeds shall all be open lay'd,
And th' obscure Mazes of their Hearts displayed;
Gnashing their Teeth, they shall their Fate bewail:
The stars harmonious daunce, and th' Sun shall fail.
The Orbs roll'd up, shrink into darkest night,
The Labourin No. shall lose her borrowed light.
Mountains ..., Plains on the same Level lye;
Vallies shall gape no more, nor Hills be high.
On the proud Billows Ships shall ride no more:
And Lightning the Earth's Face shall shrivel sore.
The crackling Rivers with fierce Fire shall burn,
Which shall their streams to solid Crystal turn.
The Heav'nly Trump shall blow a doleful sound,
And th' world's destruction, and its sin resound.
The yawning Earth Hell's vast Abyss shall shew;
All Kings before God's just Tribunal go.
Then Liquid Sulphur from the Sky shall stream,
God oil pour down Rivers of vengeful flame;
All men shall then the Glorious Cross descry,
That wished-for sign unto a faithful eye:
The Life of pious Souls, their chief dight:
To Sinners an Offence, a dismal sight!
Enlightening the called with its beams,
When cleansed from sin in twice six limpid streams.
His Empire shall be boundless, and that God
Shall Rule the Wicked with an Iron Rod;
This God, Immortal King, describ'd in Verse,
Our Saviour, dying, shall man's doom Reverse."

MANY, however, who admit that the Erythraean
Sibyl was really a prophetess, yet refuse to credit
this prediction, and imagine that some one pro
fessing our faith, and not unacquainted with the
poetic art, was the composer of these verses.
They hold, in short, that they are a forgery, and
alleged to be the prophecies of the Sibyl on the
ground of their containing useful moral senti
ments, tending to restrain licentiousness, and
to lead man to a life of sobriety and decorum.
Truth, however, in this case is evident, since
the diligence of our countrymen' has made a
careful computation of the times; so that there
is no room to suspect that this poem was com
posed after the advent and condemnation of
Christ, or that the general report is false, that
the verses were a prediction of the Sibyl in an

does not refer to this acrostic, and contains in itself a plain denial of
prophetic truth in the Sibylline prediction (whatever it was) which
the writer had in view. "Non esse autem illud carmen surentis,

Who, then, is the virgin who was to come 2
Is
it not she who was filled with, and with child of,
the Holy Spirit? And why is it impossible that
she who was with child of the Holy Spirit should
be, and ever continue to be a virgin?
This
king, too, will return, and by his coming lighten
the sorrows of the world. The poet adds,

Thou, chaste Lucina, greet the new-born child,
Beneath whose reign the iron offspring ends,
A golden progeny from heaven descends;
His kingdom banished virtue shall restore,
And crime shall threat the guilty world no more.
We perceive that these words are spoken plainly
and at the same time darkly, by way of allegory.
Those who search deeply for the import of the
words, are able to discern the Divinity of Christ.
But lest any of the powerful in the imperial city
might be able to accuse the poet of writing any
thing contrary to the laws of the country, and
subverting the religious sentiments which had
prevailed from ancient times, he intentionally
obscures the truth.
For he was acquainted, as
I believe, with that blessed mystery which gave

that they who suffer hardships in the cause of
God, shall reap sweet fruits of their own en

The merchant still shall plough the deep for gain:
Great cities shall with walls be compassed round,

Well said, wisest of bards ! Thou hast carried
the license of a poet precisely to the proper
point.
For it was not thy purpose to assume
the functions of a prophet, to which thou hadst
no claim.
I suppose also he was restrained by
a sense of the danger which threatened one
who should assail the credit of ancient religious
practice.
Cautiously, therefore, and securely,
as far as possible, he presents the truth to those
who have faculties to understand it; and while
he denounces the munitions and conflicts of
war" (which indeed are still to be found in the
course of human life), he describes our Saviour
as proceeding to the war against Troy, under
standing by Troy the world itself." And surely
he did maintain the struggle against the oppos
ing powers of evil, sent on that mission both by
the designs of his own providence and the com
mandment of his Almighty Father.

does the poet proceed?

That these Things cannot have been spoken of a

son could there be that the earth should need
neither seed nor plough, that the vine should
require no pruning-hook, or other means of
culture? How can we suppose these things to be
spoken of a mere mortal's birth P
For nature is
the minister of the Divine will, not an instrument
obedient to the command of man.
Indeed, the
very joy of the elements indicates the advent of
God, not the conception of a human being.
The prayer, too, of the poet that his life might
be prolonged is a proof of the Divinity of him
whom he invoked ; for we desire life and preser
vation from God, and not from man.
Indeed,
the Erythraean Sibyl thus appeals to God:
"Why, O Lord, dost thou compel me still to
foretell the future, and not rather remove me
from this earth to await the blessed day of thy
coming?" And Maro adds to what he had
said before :

translation of the fourth eclogue of Virgil. - Bao'."

Begin, sweet boy! with smiles thy mother know,
Who ten long months did with thy burden go.
No mortal parents smiled upon thy birth:
No nuptial joy thou know'st, no feast of earth.

How could his parents have smiled on him?
For his Father' is God, who is a Power with
out sensible quality," existing, not in any defi
nite shape, but as comprehending other beings,"
and not, therefore, in a human body.
And
who knows not that the Holy Spirit has no
participation in the nuptial union?
For what
desire can exist in the disposition of that good
which all things else desire? What fellowship,
in short, can wisdom hold with pleasure?
But
let these arguments be left to those who ascribe
to him a human origin, and who care not to
purify themselves from all evil in word as well
as deed. On thee, Piety, I
call to aid my
words, on thee who art the very law of purity,
most desirable of all blessings, teacher of holiest
hope, assured promise of immortality
Thee,
Piety, and thee, Clemency, I adore. We who
have obtained thine aid " owe thee everlasting
gratitude for thy healing power.
But the multi
tudes whom their innate hatred of thyself de
prives of thy succor, are equally estranged from
God himself, and know not that the very cause
of their life and being, and that of all the ungodly,
is connected with the rightful worship of him
who is Lord of all : for the world itself is his,
and all that it contains.

earnest endeavor to address thee with holy and
gentle words.
Yet will I say one thing, which
haply shall not be unbefitting or unseemly. A
furious, a cruel, and implacable war was main
tained by the tyrants against thee, Piety, and
thy holy churches:
nor were there wanting
some in Rome itself who exulted at a calamity
so grievous to the public weal.
Nay, the battle
field was prepared ; when thou didst stand forth,"
and present thyself a voluntary victim, supported
by faith in God. Then indeed it was that the
cruelty of ungodly men, which raged incessantly
like a devouring fire, wrought for thee a won

What, then, hast thou gained by
these atrocious deeds, most impious of men?"
And what was the cause of thy insane fury?
Thou wilt say, doubtless, these acts of thine
were done in honor of the gods. What gods
are these? or what worthy conception hast thou
of the Divine nature?
Thinkest thou the gods
are subject to angry passions as thou art? Were
it so indeed, it had been better for thee to won

If we reprove a fault,

is not our object to admonish, not to destroy ;
our correction for safety, not for cruelty? Do
we not exercise, not only sincere faith towards
God, but fidelity in the relations of social life?
Is not ours
Do we not pity the unfortunate?
a life of simplicity, which disdains to cover evil
beneath the mask of fraud and hypocrisy P Do
we not acknowledge the true God, and his un
divided sovereignty?
This is real godliness:
this is religion sincere and truly undefiled : this
is the life of wisdom ; and they who have it are
travelers, as it were, on a noble road which
leads to eternal life.
For he who has entered
on such a course, and keeps his soul pure from
the pollutions of the body, does not wholly die:
rather may he be said to complete the service
appointed him by God, than to die.
Again, he
who confesses allegiance to God is not easily
overborne by insolence or rage, but nobly stands
under the pressure of necessity and the trial
of his constancy is, as it were, a passport to the
favor of God.
For we cannot doubt that the
Deity is pleased with excellence in human con
duct.
For it would be absurd indeed if the
powerful and the humble alike acknowledge
gratitude to those from whose services they re
ceive benefit, and repay them by services in
return, and yet that he who is supreme and
sovereign of all, nay, who is Good itself, should
be negligent in this respect.
Rather does he
follow us throughout the course of our lives, is
near us in every act of goodness, accepts, and
at once rewards our virtue and obedience ;
though he defers the full recompense to that
future period, when the actions of our lives shall
pass under his review, and when those who are
clear in that account shall receive the reward of
everlasting life, while the wicked shall be visited
with the penalties due to their crimes.

To thee, Decius,' I now appeal, who has

punisher of those who lived a holy life: what is

CHAPTER XXV.

Of Diocletian, who ignobly abdicated" the Impe
rial Throne, and was ferrified by the Dread of
Alightning for his Persecution of the Church.

DIOCLETIAN, however, after the display of re
lentless cruelty as a persecutor, evinced a con
sciousness of his own guilt, and, owing to the
affliction of a disordered mind, endured the
confinement of a mean and separate dwelling."
What, then, did he gain by his active hostility
against our God? Simply this, I believe, that
he passed the residue of his life in continual
dread of the lightning's stroke.
Nicomedia
attests the fact; eyewitnesses, of whom I my
self am one, declare it. The palace, and the
emperor's private chamber were destroyed, con
sumed by lightning, devoured by the fire of
heaven. Men of understanding hearts had in
deed predicted the issue of such conduct; for
they could not keep silence, nor conceal their
grief at such unworthy deeds; but boldly and
openly expressed their
feeling, saying one to
another: "What madness is this P and what an
insolent abuse of power, that man should dare
to fight against God; should deliberately insult
the most holy and just of all religions; and plan,

chase a perpetual peace."
At length, indeed,
the providence of God took vengeance on these
unhallowed deeds; but not without severe dam
age to the state.
For the entire army of the
emperor of whom I have just spoken, becoming
subject to the authority of a worthless person,"
who had violently usurped the supreme author
ity at Rome (when the providence of God re
stored freedom to that great city), was destroyed
in several successive battles.
And when we
remember the cries with which those who were
oppressed, and who ardently longed for their
native liberty, implored the help of God; and
their praise and thanksgiving to him on the re
moval of the evils under which they had groaned,
when that liberty was regained, and free and
equitable intercourse restored : do not these
things every way afford convincing proofs of the
providence of God, and his affectionate regard
for the interests of mankind?

CHAPTER XXVI.

The Emperor ascribes his Personal Pety to God';

* [". He means Maxentius, as appears from what follows. How
Diocletian's army came under the command of Maxentius, it is
not difficult to understand.
After Diocletian's abdication, Galerius
Maximian took the command of his forces, giving part to Severus
Caesar for the defence of Italy.
Shortly afterwards, Maxentius
having usurped the Imperial power at Rome, Galerius sent Severus
against him with his forces. Maxentius, however, fraudulently and
by promises corrupted and drew to his own side Severus's army.
After this, Galerius, having marched against Maxentius with a more
numerous force, was himself in like manner deserted by his troops.
Thus the army of Diocletian came under the power of Maxentius."
(Valesius ad loc.). - Bag. J

the cause of the exploits I have performed?
Assuredly they do :
for it belongs to God to do
whatever is best, and to man, to perform the
commands of God.
I believe, indeed, the best
and noblest course of action is, when, before an
attempt is made, we provide as far as possible
for a secure result: and surely all men know that
the holy service in which these hands have been
employed has originated in pure and genuine
faith towards God; that whatever has been done
for the common welfare has been effected by
active exertion combined with supplication and
prayer; the consequence of which has been
as great an amount of individual and public
benefit as each could venture to hope for him
self and those he holds most dear. They have
witnessed battles, and have been spectators of
a war in which the providence of God has granted
victory to this people : " they have seen how he
has favored and seconded our prayers.
For
righteous prayer is a thing invincible; and no
one fails to attain his object who addresses
holy supplication to God: nor is a refusal possi
ble, except in the case of wavering faith; * for
God is ever favorable, ever ready to approve of
human virtue.
While, therefore, it is natural for
man occasionally to err, yet God is not the cause
of human error.
Hence it becomes all pious
persons to render thanks to the Saviour of all,
first for our own individual security, and then
for the happy posture of public affairs: at the
same time intreating the favor of Christ with
holy prayers and constant supplications, that he
would continue to us our present blessings. For
he is the invincible ally and protector of the
righteous: he is the supreme judge of all things,
the prince of immortality, the Giver of everlast
ing life.

i.e. the Roman. So I'al. and Hein., but I'al. thinks it may

perhaps rather be "to my army."

* Better, literally, "slackening faith."

There is somewhat of
loss from the primitive and real conception of faith in the fixing of
the word "wavering" as the conventional expression for weak;
Faith is the steadfast current of personality towards an object, and
| poverty of faith is more often the abatement or slackening of that
steady, insistent activity than the wavering of doubt. There is more
unbelief than disbelies.

knowledge; and account the choice of the latter
as the real excellence, will prefer those virtues
of the emperor which Heaven itself approves,
and his pious actions, to his merely human
accomplishments; and will leave to inferior en
comiasts the task of celebrating his lesser
merits.
For since our emperor is gifted as
well with that sacred wisdom which has im
mediate reference to God, as with the knowledge
which concerns the interests of men ; let those
who are competent to such a task describe his
secular acquirements, great and transcendent as
they are, and fraught with advantage to man
kind (for all that characterizes the emperor is
great and noble), yet still inferior to his diviner
qualities, to those who stand without the
sacred precincts.
Let those, however, who
are within the sanctuary, and have access to
its inmost and untrodden recesses, close the
doors against every profane ear, and unfold, as
it were, the secret mysteries of our emperor's
character to the initiated alone. And let those
who have purified their ears in the streams of
piety, and raised their thoughts on the soaring
wing of the mind itself, join the company which
surrounds the Sovereign Lord of all, and

the spirit of divination (or rather let me say of
madness and folly), but by the inspiration of
Divine truth," be our instructors in these myste

the heavenly array which surrounds the Lord of
all ; of that exemplar of imperial power which

lastly, of the consequences which result from
With these oracles, then, to initiate us

in the knowledge of the sacred rites, let us
essay, as follows, the commencement of our
divine mysteries.

CHAPTER I.

The Oration.

l

To-DAY is the festival of our great em
peror: and we his children rejoice therein,
feeling the inspiration of our sacred theme. He
who presides over our solemnity is the Great
Sovereign himself; he, I mean, who is truly
great; of whom I affirm (nor will the sovereign
who hears me be offended, but will rather ap
prove of this ascription of praise to God), that
HE is above and beyond all created things, the
Highest, the Greatest, the most Mighty One ;
whose throne is the arch of heaven, and the
His being none
earth the footstool of his feet."
can worthily comprehend ; and the ineffable
surrounds him
splendor of the glory which
gaze of every eye from his
repels the
Divine majesty.
His ministers are the heav
enly hosts; his armies the supernal powers,
who own allegiance to him as their Master,
Lord, and King. The countless multitudes of
angels, the companies of archangels, the chorus
of holy spirits, draw from and reflect his radi
ance as from the fountains of everlasting light.
Yea, every light, and specially those divine and
incorporeal intelligences whose place is beyond
the heavenly sphere, celebrate this august Sov
ereign with lofty and sacred strains of praise.
The vast expanse of heaven, like an azure veil,
is interposed between those without, and those
who inhabit his royal mansions: while round
this expanse the sun and moon, with the rest
of the heavenly luminaries (like torch-bearers
around the entrance of the imperial palace),
perform, in honor of their sovereign, their ap
pointed courses; holding forth, at the word of
his command, an ever-burning light to those
whose lot is cast in the darker regions with
out the pale of heaven. And surely when
I remember that our own victorious em
peror renders praises to this Mighty Sovereign,
I do well to follow him, knowing as I do that to
him alone we owe that imperial power under
which we live.
The pious Caesars, instructed
by their father's wisdom, acknowledge him as
the source of every blessing: the soldiery, the
entire body of the people, both in the country
and in the cities of the empire, with the gov
ernors of the several provinces, assembling to

* Paraphrased from Is lxvi. 1.

gether in accordance with the precept of their
great Saviour and Teacher, worship him.
In
short, the whole family of mankind, of every na
tion, tribe, and tongue, both collectively and sev
erally, however diverse their opinions on other
subjects, are unanimous in this one confession ;
and, in obedience to the reason implanted in
them, and the spontaneous and uninstructed im
pulse of their own minds, unite in calling on
the One and only God."
Nay, does not the
universal frame of earth acknowledge him
her Lord, and declare, by the vegetable and
animal life which she produces, her subjection
to the will of a superior Power? The rivers,
flowing with abundant stream, and the perennial
fountains, springing from hidden and exhaust
less depths, ascribe to him the cause of their
marvellous source. The mighty waters of the
sea, enclosed in chambers of unfathomable
depth, and the swelling surges, which lift them
selves on high, and menace as it were the earth
itself, shrink back when they approach the
shore, checked by the power of his Divine law.
The duly measured fall of winter's rain, the
rolling thunder, the lightning's flash, the eddy
ing currents of the winds, and the airy courses
of the clouds, all reveal his presence to
those to whom his Person is invisible. The
all-radiant sun, who holds his constant ca
reer through the lapse of ages, owns him Lord
alone, and obedient to his will, dares not de
part from his appointed path.
The inferior
splendor of the moon, alternately diminished
and increased at stated periods, is subject to
his Divine command. The beauteous mechan
ism of the heavens, glittering with the hosts of
stars, moving in harmonious order, and pre
serving the measure of each several orbit, pro
claims him the giver of all light: yea, all the
heavenly luminaries, maintaining at his will and
word a grand and perfect unity of motion, pur
sue the track of their ethereal career, and com
plete in the lapse of revolving ages their distant
course. The alternate recurrence of day and
night, the changing seasons, the order and pro
portion of the universe, all declare the manifold
wisdom of [his boundless power].
To him
the unseen agencies which hold their course
throughout the expanse of space, render the
due tribute of praise.
To him this terrestrial
globe itself, to him the heavens above, and the
choirs beyond the vault of heaven, give honor
as to their mighty Sovereign: the angelic hosts
greet him with ineffable songs of Praise; and
the spirits which draw their being from incor
The

* [We must be content here (and probably in other passages of
this Oration) to tolerate as rhetorical embellishment that which,

intention of the passage is probably like that of those who say now
that there is no nation where, in some form, God is not o

everlasting ages which were before this heaven
and earth, with other periods beside them, in
finite, and antecedent to all visible creation,
acknowledge him the sole and supreme
Sovereign and Lord.
Lastly, he who is in
all, before, and after all," his only begotten,
pre-existent Word, the great High Priest of the
mighty God, elder than all time and every age,
devoted to his Father's glory, first and alone
makes intercession with him for the salvation
of mankind." Supreme and pre-eminent Ruler
of the universe, he shares the glory of his
for he is that Light, which,
Father's kingdom :
transcendent above the universe, encircles the
Father's Person, interposing and dividing be

all derived existence : that Light which, stream
ing from on high, proceeds from that Deity who
knows not origin or end, and illumines the
super-celestial regions, and all that heaven itself
contains, with the radiance of wisdom bright
beyond the splendor of the sun.
This is he
who holds a supreme dominion over this whole
world," who is over and in all things, and per
things" visible and invisible; the

From whom and by whom our
divinely favored emperor, receiving, as it were,
a transcript of the Divine sovereignty, directs, in
imitation of God himself, the administration of
this world's affairs.

CHAPTER II.

l

This only begotten Word of God reigns,
from ages which had no beginning, to infi
nite and endless ages, the partner of his Father's
kingdom. And [our emperor] ever beloved by
him, who derives the source of imperial authority
from above, and is strong in the power of his
sacred title,' has controlled the empire of
the world for a long period of years. Again,
that Preserver of the universe orders these
heavens and earth, and the celestial kingdom,
consistently with his Father's will.
Even so our
emperor whom he loves, by bringing those whom
he rules on earth to the only begotten Word and
Saviour renders them fit subjects of his
kingdom. And as he who is the common

Our emperor, emulous of his Divine example,
having purged his earthly dominion from every
stain of impious error, invites each holy and
pious worshiper within his imperial mansions,
earnestly desiring to save with all its crew that
mighty vessel of which he is the appointed pilot.
And he alone of all who have wielded the im
perial power of Rome, being honored by the
Supreme Sovereign with a reign of three decen

his ancestors might have done, in honor of infer

is grateful to him ; and this sacrifice our
emperor has learned, with
purified mind and
thoughts, to present as an offering without the

to the belief of the Middle Ages, are disembodied souls which clothe
themselves again in their buried bodies, steal at night into houscs,
and suck from the nipple of the sleeping all their blood." . (Cf. Perty,

superstition that cats suck away the breath of sleeping children.

imitates his Divine philanthropy by his own im
perial acts.
Wholly devoted to him, he dedi
cates himself as a noble offering, a first-fruit of
that world, the government of which is intrusted
to his charge.
This first and greatest sacrifice
our emperor first dedicates to God; and then,
as a faithful shepherd, he offers, not "famous
hecatombs of firstling lambs," but the souls of
that flock which is the object of his care, those
rational beings whom he leads to the knowledge
and pious worship of God.

CHAPTER III.

AND gladly does he accept and welcome
this sacrifice, and commend the presenter
of so august and noble an offering, by protract
ing his reign to a lengthened period of years,
giving larger proofs of his beneficence in pro
portion to the emperor's holy services to him
self.
Accordingly he permits him to celebrate
each successive festival during great and general
prosperity throughout the empire, advancing one
of his sons, at the recurrence of each decennial
period, to a share of his own imperial
power." The eldest, who bears his father's
name, he received as his partner in the em
pire about the close of the first decade of his
reign : the second, next in point of age, at the
second ; and the third in like manner at the
third decennial period, the occasion of this our
present festival. And now that the fourth period
has commenced, and the time of his reign is
still further prolonged, he desires to extend his
imperial authority by calling still more of his
kindred to partake his power; and, by the ap
pointment of the Caesars," fulfills the predictions
of the holy prophets, according to what they
uttered ages before: "And the saints of the
Most High shall take the kingdom." And
thus the Almighty Sovereign himself accords
an increase both of years and of children to our
most pious emperor, and renders his sway over
the nations of the world still fresh and flourishing,
as though it were even now springing up in its
earliest vigor. He it is who appoints him this
present festival, in that he has made him victo
rious over every enemy that disturbed his peace :
he it is who displays him as an example of
true godliness to the human race. And
thus our emperor, like the radiant sun, illu
minates the most distant subjects of his empire

It is surely needless to remark on so singular
and vicious an application of Scripture as this, further than that it

of the fourth century. - Poo. 1. "But the saints of the Most High

through the presence of the Caesars, as with the
far piercing rays of his own brightness. To us
who occupy the eastern regions he has given a
son worthy of himself; * a second and a third
respectively to other departments of his empire,
to be, as it were, brilliant reflectors of the light
which proceeds from himself.
Once more, hav
ing harnessed, as it were, under the self-same
yoke the four most noble Caesars" as horses in
the imperial chariot, he sits on high and directs
their course by the reins of holy harmony and con
cord; and, himself every where present, and ob
servant of every event, thus traverses every
region of the world.
Lastly, invested as he
is with a semblance of heavenly sovereignty,
he directs his gaze above, and frames his earthly
government according to the pattern of that
Divine original, feeling strength in its conformity
to the monarchy of God. And this conformity
is granted by the universal Sovereign to man
alone of the creatures of this earth: for he only
is the author of sovereign power, who decrees
that all should be subject to the rule of one.
And surely monarchy far transcends every
other constitution and form of government:
for that democratic equality of power, which is
its opposite, may rather be described as anarchy
and disorder. Hence there is one God, and not
two, or three, or more : for to assert a plurality
of gods is plainly to deny the being of God at
all.
There is one Sovereign; and his Word and
royal Law is one : a Law not expressed in sylla
bles and words, not written or engraved on tab
lets, and therefore subject to the ravages of time;
but the living and self-subsisting Word, who him
self is God, and who administers his Father's
kingdom on behalf of all who are after him
and subject to his power. His attendants are
the heavenly hosts; the myriads of God's
angelic ministers; the super-terrestrial armies,
of unnumbered multitude ; and those unseen
spirits within heaven itself, whose agency is em
ployed in regulating the order of this world.
Ruler and chief of all these is the royal Word,
acting as Regent of the Supreme Sovereign.
To him the names of Captain, and great High
Priest, Prophet of the Father, Angel of mighty
counsel, Brightness of the Father's light, Only
begotten Son, with a thousand other titles, are
ascribed in the oracles of the sacred writers.
And the Father, having constituted him the liv
ing Word, and Law, and Wisdom, the fullness of
all blessing, has presented this best and greatest
gift to all who are the subjects of his sov
ereignty.
And he himself, who pervades
all things, and is every where present, un
folding his Father's bounties to all with unspar
ing hand, has accorded a specimen of his sov

ereign power even to his rational creatures of
this earth, in that he has provided the mind of
man, who is formed after his own image, with
Divine faculties, whence it is capable of other
virtues also, which flow from the same heavenly
source.
For he only is wise, who is the only
God : he only is essentially good : he only is of
mighty power, the Parent of justice, the Father
of reason and wisdom, the Fountain of light
and life, the Dispenser of truth and virtue: in
a word, the Author of empire itself, and of all
dominion and power.

CHAPTER IV.

BUT whence has man this knowledge, and
* who has ministered these truths to mortal
ears?
Or whence has a tongue of flesh the
power to speak of things so utterly distinct from
fleshly or material substance? Who has gazed
on the invisible King, and beheld these perfec
tions in him? The bodily sense may compre
hend elements and their combinations, of a
nature kindred to its own : but no one yet
has boasted to have scanned with corporeal eye
that unseen kingdom which governs all things;
nor has mortal nature yet discerned the beauty
of perfect wisdom. Who has beheld the face
of righteousness through the medium of flesh?
And whence came the idea of legitimate sover
eignty and imperial power to man? Whence
the thought of absolute dominion to a being
composed of flesh and blood? Who declared
those ideas which are invisible and undefined,
and that incorporeal essence which has no ex
ternal form, to the mortals of this earth?
Surely there was but one interpreter of
these things; the all-pervading Word of
God."
For he is the author of that rational and
intelligent being which exists in man ; and, being
himself one with his Father's Divine nature, he
sheds upon his offspring the out-flowings of his

taught powers of thought, which all men, Greeks
or Barbarians, alike possess: hence the percep
tion of reason and wisdom, the seeds of integ
rity and righteousness, the understanding of the
arts of life, the knowledge of virtue, the precious
name of wisdom, and the noble love of philo
sophic learning.
Hence the knowledge of all
that is great and good ; hence apprehension of
God himself, and a life worthy of his worship :
hence the royal authority of man, and his invin
cible lordship over the creatures of this
world. And when that Word, who is the
Parent of rational beings, had impressed a
character on the mind of man according to the
1. "And no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and
who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will
eth to reveal him." - Luke x. 22.

image and likeness of God," and had made him
a royal creature, in that he gave him alone of
all earthly creatures capacity to rule and to obey
(as well as forethought and foreknowledge even
here, concerning the promised hope of his
heavenly kingdom, because of which he him
self came, and, as the Parent of his children,
disdained not to hold converse with mortal
men); he continued to cherish the seeds which
himself had sown, and renewed his gracious
favors from above; holding forth to all the
promise of sharing his heavenly kingdom. Ac
cordingly he called men, and exhorted them to
be ready for their heavenward journey, and to
provide themselves with the garment which be
came their calling.
And by an indescribable
power he filled the world in every part with his
doctrine, expressing by the similitude of an
earthly kingdom that heavenly one to which he
earnestly invites all mankind, and presents it to
them as a worthy object of their hope.

CHAPTER V.

AND in this hope our divinely-favored
emperor partakes even in this present life,
gifted as he is by God with native virtues, and
having received into his soul the out-flowings of
his favor.
His reason he derives from the great
Source of all reason: he is wise, and good, and
just, as having fellowship with perfect Wisdom,
Goodness, and Righteousness: virtuous, as fol
lowing the pattern of perfect virtue: valiant,
as partaking of heavenly strength.
And
truly may he deserve the imperial title, who
has formed his soul to royal virtues, according
But
to the standard of that celestial kingdom.
he who is a stranger to these blessings, who de
nies the Sovereign of the universe, and owns no
allegiance to the heavenly Father of spirits; who
invests not himself with the virtues which become
an emperor, but overlays his soul with moral de
formity and baseness; who for royal clemency
substitutes the fury of a savage beast; for a
generous temper, the incurable venom of mali
cious wickedness; for prudence, folly; for rea
son and wisdom, that recklessness which is the
most odious of all vices, for from it, as from a
spring of bitterness, proceed the most pernicious
fruits; such as inveterate profligacy of life, covet
ousness, murder, impiety and defiance of God;
surely one abandoned to such vices as these, how
ever he may be deemed powerful through des
potic violence, has no true title to the name
of Emperor.
For how should he whose soul
is impressed with a thousand absurd images of

can he be absolute lord of others, who has sub

cruel masters? a slave of low delights and un
governed lust, a slave of wrongfully-extorted
wealth, of rage and passion, as well as of
cowardice and terror; a slave of ruthless
demons, and soul-destroying spirits?
Let,
then, our emperor, on the testimony of
truth itself, be declared alone worthy of the
title ; who is dear to the Supreme Sovereign
himself; who alone is free, nay, who is truly
lord: above the thirst of wealth, superior to

pleasures; controlling, not controlled by, anger

of men ; whose character is formed after the

to himself, even from heaven itself.
Declaring
the august title of supreme authority by the

that imperial purple which so well becomes
him. He is indeed an emperor, who calls
on and implores in prayer the favor of his
heavenly Father night and day, and whose ardent

* There seems to be a clear hint of Philonism here, or Philonism
as developed by the Neo-Platonists and the Christian. Theologians.
The history of the thought seems to begin in the Platonic ideas.
These self-existing forms which impress themselves on the soul
naturally become personalities to which the soul submits, and
whose images are impressed on the soul. These personalized ideas
are in the thought of Philo the thoughts or ideas of God, "powers"
who do his will, like the Valkyr of the Northern mythology, - the
personified thoughts or will of Odin. These objective ideas in or
ganized whole were the Word.

The objectivity of ideas, placed in relation with "mind reading,"
" thought transference," and the like, and with the modern concep
tions of the conservation of energy and transmission of force by
vibrations, give an interesting suggestion of a material basis for the
conception.
If thought is accompanied by vibration of brain mole
cules, it is of course quite conceivable that that vibration be projected
through any medium which can transmit vibration, whether the
nerves of another person or the air. A person of supreme energy of
will would make these vibrations more intense, and an Infinite per
sonality would make tangible even perhaps to the point of that re
sistance which we call matter. The conception of one great central
Personality issuing an organized related system of thoughts in vari
ous stages of embodiment, in one massive, constant forth-streaming
of will, is most interesting.
According to it, all will forms of the in.

however, the lesser ". project incongruous will forms, they are in

to what it submits itself to, whether to the lesser and mal-organized
or to the Great Norm.

it is to be remembered, was characteristic also of his father, and in a
measure the product of the Neo-Platonic philosophy.

°. Literally, the "archetypal idea," - the same phrase as that

model or image of God on which the corporcal world was formcd.

desires are fixed on his celestial kingdom.
For
he knows that present things, subject as they
are to decay and death, flowing on and disap
pearing like a river's stream, are not worthy to
be compared with him who is sovereign of all;
therefore it is that he longs for the incorrupti
ble and incorporeal kingdom of God. And this
kingdom he trusts he shall obtain, elevating his
mind as he does in sublimity of thought above
the vault of heaven, and filled with inexpressible
longing for the glories which shine there, in
comparison with which he deems the precious
things of this present world but darkness.
For
he sees earthly sovereignty to be but a petty
and fleeting dominion over a mortal and tem
porary life, and rates it not much higher than
the goatherd's, or shepherd's, or herdsman's
power: nay, as more burdensome than theirs,
and exercised over more stubborn subjects.

of flattery, he reckons rather troublesome than

of his armies, the multitudes of horse and foot,
entirely devoted to his command, he feels no
astonishment, no pride at the possession of such
mighty power; but turns his thoughts inward
on himself, and recognizes the same common
nature there.
He smiles at his vesture, em
broidered with gold and flowers, and at the
imperial purple and diadem itself, when he sees
the multitude gaze in wonder, like children at
a bugbear, on the splendid spectacle."
Himself
superior to such feelings, he clothes his soul
with the knowledge of God, that vesture, the
broidery of which is temperance, righteous
ness, piety, and all other virtues; a vesture
such as truly becomes a sovereign. The
wealth which others so much desire, as
gold, silver, or precious gems, he regards to be,

this truth by personal experience in the use of
these things, he regards the splendid attire of
his subjects with calm indifference, and smiles
at the childishness of those to whom they prove
attractive.
Lastly, he abstains from all excess
in food and wine, and leaves superfluous dain

and watered it both with rain and water-springs,
he caused it to abound in plants and flowers of
every species, for the enjoyment of life. And
when he had formed man in his own likeness,
the noblest of earthly creatures, and dearest to
himself, a creature gifted with
intellect and
knowledge, the child of reason and wisdom,
he gave him dominion over all other animals
which move and live upon the earth.
For man
was in truth of all earthly creatures the dearest
to God: man, I say, to whom, as an indulgent
Father, he has subjected the brute creation; for
whom he has made the ocean navigable, and
crowned the earth with a profusion of plants of
every kind; to whom he has granted reasoning
faculties for acquiring all science; under whose
control he has placed even the creatures of the
deep, and the winged inhabitants of the air; to
whom he has permitted the contemplation of
celestial objects, and revealed the course and
changes of the sun and moon, and the periods
of the planets and fixed stars.
In short, to man
alone of earthly beings has he given command
ment to acknowledge him as his heavenly Father,
and to celebrate his praises as the Supreme
Sovereign of eternity itself.
But the un
changeable course of eternity the Creator
has limited by the four seasons of the year, ter
minating the winter by the approach of spring,
and regulating as with an equal balance that
season which commences the annual period.
Having thus graced the eternal course of time
with the varied productions of spring, he added
the summer's heat; and then granted as it were

a relief of toil by the interval of autumn : and
lastly, refreshing and cleansing the season by the
showers of winter, he brings it, rendered sleek
and glossy, like a noble steed, by these abun
dant rains, once more to the gates of spring.
As soon, then, as the Supreme Sovereign
had thus connected his own eternity by
these cords of wisdom with the annual circle, he
committed it to the guidance of a mighty Gov
ernor, even his only begotten Word, to whom,
as the Preserver of all creation, he yielded the
reins of universal power. And he, receiving
this inheritance as from a beneficent Father,
and uniting all things both above. and beneath
the circumference of heaven in one harmonious
whole, directs their uniform course; providing
with perfect justice whatever is expedient for
his rational creatures on the earth, appointing
its allotted limits to human life, and granting to
all alike permission to anticipate even here the
commencement of a future existence.
For he
has taught them that beyond this present world
there is a divine and blessed state of being,
reserved for those who have been supported here
by the hope of heavenly blessings; and that
those who have lived a virtuous and godly life
will remove hence to a far better habitation ;
while he adjudges to those who have been guilty
and wicked here a place of punishment ac
cording to their crimes.
Again, as in the
distribution of prizes at the public games,
he proclaims various crowns to the victors, and,
invests each with the rewards of different vir
tues: but for our good emperor, who is clothed
in the very robe of piety, he declares that a
higher recompense of his toils is prepared ; and,
as a prelude to this recompense, permits us now
to assemble at this festival, which is composed
of perfect numbers, of decades thrice, and
triads ten times repeated.
The first of
these, the triad, is the offspring of the unit,
while the unit is the mother of number itself, and
presides over all months, and seasons, and years,
It may, indeed, be
and every period of time.
justly termed the origin, foundation, and principle
of all number, and derives its name from its abid
ing character."
For, while every other number
is diminished or increased according to the sub
traction or addition of others, the unit alone
continues fixed and steadfast, abstracted from
all multitude and the numbers which are formed
from it, and resembling that indivisible essence
which is distinct from all things beside, but by
virtue of participation in which the nature
of all things else subsists.
For the unit is
the originator of every number, since all

ll

* [Movăs, mapá rà uévetv ovouaou evm.

The analogies from
number in this chapter (which the reader will probably consider
puerile enough) seem to be an imitation of some of the mystical
speculations of Plato. - Bag.]

THE ORATION OF EUSEBIUS.

multitude is made up by the composition and
addition of units; nor is it possible without the
unit to conceive the existence of number at all.
But the unit itself is independent of multitude,
apart from and superior to all number ; form
ing, indeed, and making all, but receiving
no increase from any.
Kindred to this is
the triad ; equally indivisible and perfect,
the first of those sums which are formed of even
and uneven numbers.
For the perfect number
two, receiving the addition of the unit, forms
the triad, the first perfect compound number.
And the triad, by explaining what equality is,
first taught men justice, having itself an equal
beginning, and middle, and end. And it is also
an image of the mysterious, most holy, and royal
Trinity, which, though itself without beginning
or origin, yet contains the germs, the reasons,
and causes of the existence of all created
things. Thus the power of the triad may
justly be regarded as the first cause of all
things.
Again, the number ten, which contains
the end of all numbers, and terminates them in
itself, may truly be called a full and perfect
number, as comprehending every species and
every measure of numbers, proportions, con
cords, and harmonies.
For example, the units
by addition form and are terminated by the
number ten ; and, having this number as their
parent, and as it were the limit of their course,
they round this as the goal of their career.
15 Then they perform a second circuit, and
again a third, and a fourth, until the tenth,
and thus by ten decades they complete the hun
dredth number.
Returning thence to the first
starting point, they again proceed to the num
ber ten, and having ten times completed the
hundredth number, again they recede, and per
form round the same barriers their protracted
course, proceeding from themselves back to
themselves again, with revolving motion.
For the unit is the tenth of ten, and ten
units make up a decade, which is itself the
limit, the settled goal and boundary of units: it
is that which terminates the infinity of number;
the term and end of units.
Again, the triad
combined with the decade, and performing a
threefold circuit of tens, produces that most

respect to tens.
It is also the constant
limit to the course of that luminary which
is second to the sun in brightness.

course of the moon from one conjunction with
the sun to the next, completes the period of a

blessing, accomplishing, at present, this tricen

festival, but reaching forward beyond
this to far more distant intervals of time, and
cherishing the hope of future blessings in the
celestial kingdom ; where, not a single sun, but
infinite hosts of light surround the Almighty Sov
ereign, each surpassing the splendor of the sun,
glorious and resplendent with rays derived
from the everlasting source of light. There
the soul enjoys its existence, surrounded by
fair and unfading blessings; there is a life be
yond the reach of sorrow ; there the enjoyment
of pure and holy pleasures, and a time of un
measured and endless duration, extending into
illimitable space; not defined by intervals of
days and months, the revolutions of years, or
the recurrence of times and seasons, but com
mensurate with a life which knows no end. And
this life needs not the light of the sun, nor the

is that the
mystic and sacred oracles reveal him to be
the Sun of righteousness, and the Light which
far transcends all light. We believe that he illu
mines also the thrice-blessed powers of heaven
with the rays of righteousness, and the brightness
of wisdom, and that he receives truly pious souls,
not within the sphere of heaven alone, but into
his own bosom, and confirms indeed the
assurances which he himself has given. No 21
mortal eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor can
the mind in its vesture of flesh understand what
things are prepared for those who have been
here adorned with the graces of godliness;
blessings which await thee too, most pious em
peror, to whom alone since the world began has
the Almighty Sovereign of the universe granted
power to purify the course of human life : to
whom also he has revealed his own symbol of
salvation, whereby he overcame the power of
death, and triumphed over every enemy. And
this victorious trophy, the scourge of evil spirits,
thou hast arrayed against the errors of idol wor
ship, and hast obtained the victory not only
over all thy impious and savage foes, but over
equally barbarous adversaries, the evil spirits
themselves.

Hence it

CHAPTER VII.

For whereas we are composed of two
distinct natures, I mean of body and spirit,
of which the one is visible to all, the other
invisible, against both these natures two kinds
of barbarous and savage enemies, the one invis
ibly, the other openly, are constantly arrayed.

The one oppose our bodies with bodily force :
the other with incorporeal assaults besiege
Again, the visible

barbarians, like the wild nomad tribes, no
better than savage beasts, assail the nations of
civilized men, ravage their country, and enslave
their cities, rushing on those who inhabit them
like ruthless wolves of the desert, and destroying
all who fall under their power.
But those unseen
foes, more cruel far than barbarians, I mean the
soul-destroying demons whose course is through
the regions of the air, had succeeded, through
the snares of vile polytheism, in enslaving the
entire human race, insomuch that they no longer
recognized the true God, but wandered in the
mazes of atheistic error.
For they procured, I
know not whence, gods who never anywhere
existed, and set him aside who is the only
and the true God, as though he were not.
Accordingly the generation of bodies was
esteemed by them a deity, and so the op
posite principle to this, their dissolution and
destruction, was also deified. The first, as the
author of generative power, was honored with
rites under the name of Venus:" the second,
as rich, and mighty in dominion over the human
race, received the names of Pluto, and Death.
For men in those ages, knowing no other than
naturally generated life, declared the cause and
origin of that life to be divine : and again, believ
ing in no existence after death, they proclaimed
Death himself a universal conqueror and a
mighty god.
Hence, unconscious of respon
sibility, as destined to be annihilated by death,
they lived a life unworthy of the name, in the
practice of actions deserving a thousand deaths.
No thought of God could enter their minds, no
expectation of Divine judgment, no recollection
of, no reflection on, their spiritual existence:
acknowledging one dread superior, Death, and
persuaded that the dissolution of their bodies by
his power was final annihilation, they bestowed
on Death the title of a mighty, a wealthy god,
Thus, then,
and hence the name of Pluto."
Death became to them a god ; nor only so, but
whatever else they accounted precious in com
parison with death, whatever contributed to
the luxuries of life. Hence animal pleasure
became to them a god ; nutrition, and its
production, a god ; the fruit of trees, a god ;
drunken riot, a god ; carnal desire and pleasure,
a god.
Hence the mysteries of Ceres and Pros
erpine, the rape of the latter, and her subse
quent restoration, by Pluto: hence the orgies of
Bacchus, and Hercules overcome by drunken
ness as by a mightier god : hence the adulterous
rites of Cupid and of Venus: hence Jupiter him

foes, but

self infatuated with the love of women, and of
Ganymede : " hence the licentious legends of
deities abandoned to effeminacy and pleas
ure. Such were the weapons of superstition
whereby these cruel barbarians and enemies
of the Supreme God afflicted, and indeed en
tirely subdued, the human race ; erecting every
where the monuments of impiety, and rearing
in every corner the shrines and temples of
their false religion.
Nay, so far were the
ruling powers of those times enslaved by
the force of error, as to appease their gods with
the blood of their own countrymen and kindred ;
to whet their swords against those who stood
forward to defend the truth ; to maintain a ruth
less war and raise unholy hands, not against
foreign or barbarian
against men
bound to them by the ties of family and affec
tion, against brethren, and kinsmen, and dearest
friends, who had resolved, in the practice of
virtue and true piety, to honor and worship
God.
Such was the spirit of madness with
which these princes sacrificed to their de
mon deities men consecrated to the service of
the King of kings.
On the other hand their
victims, as noble martyrs in the cause of true
godliness, resolved to welcome a glorious death
in preference to life itself, and utterly despised
these cruelties.
Strengthened, as soldiers of
God, with patient fortitude, they mocked at
death in all its forms; at fire, and sword, and
the torment of crucifixion; at exposure to sav
age beasts, and drowning in the depths of the
sea; at the cutting off and searing of limbs, the
digging out of eyes, the mutilation of the whole
body; lastly, at famine, the labor of the mines,
and captivity:
nay, all these sufferings they
counted better than any earthly good or pleas
ure, for the love they bore their heavenly King.
In like manner women also evinced a spirit of
constancy and courage not inferior to that
of men. Some endured the same conflicts
with them, and obtained a like reward of
their virtue: others, forcibly carried off to be
the victims of violence and pollution, welcomed
death rather than dishonor; while many, very
many more, endured not even to hear the same
threats wherewith they were assailed by the
provincial governors, but boldly sustained every
variety of torture, and sentence of death in
every form." Thus did these valiant soldiers of
the Almighty Sovereign maintain the conflict
with steadfast fortitude of soul against the hos
tile forces of polytheism: and thus did these
enemies of God and adversaries of man's sal
vation, more cruel far than the ferocious savage,
delight in libations of human blood : thus did

their ministers drain as it were the cup of un
righteous slaughter in honor of the demons
whom they served, and prepare for them this
dread and impious banquet, to the ruin of
the human race.
In these sad circum
stances, what course should the God and
King of these afflicted ones pursue? Could he
be careless of the safety of his dearest friends,
or abandon his servants in this great extremity?
Surely none could deem him a wary pilot, who,
without an effort to save his fellow-mariners,
should suffer his vessel to sink with all her crew :
surely no general could be found so reckless as
to yield his own allies, without resistance, to the
mercy of the foe: nor can a faithful shepherd
regard with unconcern the straying of a single
sheep from his flock, but will rather leave the
rest in safety, and dare all things for the wan
derer's sake, even, if need be, to contend
with savage beasts. The zeal, however, of
the great Sovereign of all was for no uncon
scious" sheep : his care was exercised for his
own faithful host, for those who sustained the
battle for his sake : whose conflicts in the cause
of godliness he himself approved, and hon
ored those who had returned to his presence
with the prize of victory which he only can
bestow, uniting them to the angelic choirs.
Others he still preserved on earth, to commu

Such
were the dealings of the Supreme Sover
eign, who ordained an invincible champion to
be the minister of his heaven-sent vengeance
(for our emperor's surpassing piety delights in
the title of Servant of God), and him he has
proved victorious over all that opposed him,
having raised him up, an individual against
many foes.

twofold race of barbarians; soothing the savage
tribes of men by prudent embassies, compelling
them to know and acknowledge their superiors,
and reclaiming them from a lawless and brutal
life to the governance of reason and humanity;
at the same time that he proved by the facts
themselves that the fierce and ruthless race of
unseen spirits had long ago been vanquished by
a higher power.
For he who is the preserver
of the universe had punished these invisible
spirits by an invisible judgment: and our em
peror, as the delegate of the Supreme Sovereign,
has followed up the victory, bearing away the
spoils of those who have long since died and
mouldered into dust, and distributing the plun
der with lavish hand among the soldiers of his
victorious Lord."

CHAPTER VIII.

l

For as soon as he understood that the
ignorant multitudes were inspired with a
vain and childish dread of these bugbears of
error, wrought in gold and silver, he judged
it right to remove these also, like stumbling
stones thrown in the path of men walking in
the dark, and henceforward to open a royal
Havroad, plain and unobstructed, to all.
ing formed this resolution, he considered
that no soldiers or military force of any sort
was needed for the repression of the evil: a
few of his own friends sufficed for this service,
and these he sent by a simple expression of
his will to visit each several province.
Accordingly, sustained by confidence in the
emperor's piety and their own personal devo
tion to God, they passed through the midst of
numberless tribes and nations, abolishing this
ancient system of error in every city and coun
try. They ordered the priests themselves, in
the midst of general laughter and scorn, to
bring their gods from their dark recesses to the
light of day. They then stripped them of their
ornaments, and exhibited to the gaze of all the
unsightly reality which had been hidden beneath
a painted exterior: and lastly, whatever part of
the material appeared to be of value they scraped
off and melted in the fire to prove its worth,
after which they secured and set apart whatever
they judged needful for their purposes, leaving
to the superstitious worshipers what was alto
gether useless, as a memorial of their
shame.
Meanwhile our admirable prince
was himself engaged in a work similar to
that we have described.
For at the same time
that these costly images of the dead were
stripped, as we have said, of their precious

* [That is, stripping the images of those whose temples, he de

CONSTANTINE.

materials, he also attacked those composed of
brass; causing those to be dragged from their
places with ropes, and, as it were, carried away
captive, whom the dotage of mythology had
esteemed as gods. The next care of our august
emperor was to kindle, as it were, a brilliant
torch, by the light of which he directed his
imperial gaze around, to see if any hidden
vestiges of error might yet exist. And as
the keen-sighted eagle in its heavenward
flight is able to descry from its lofty height the
most distant objects on the earth: so did he,
whilst residing in the imperial palace of his own
fair city, discover, as from a watch-tower, a hid
den and fatal snare of souls in the province of
Phoenicia.
This was a grove and temple, not
situated in the midst of any city, or in any pub
lic place, as for splendor of effect is gener
ally the case, but apart from the beaten
and frequented road, on part of the summit
of Mount Lebanon, and dedicated to the foul
demon known by the name of Venus.
It was
a school of wickedness for all the abandoned
votaries of impurity and such as destroyed their
bodies with effeminacy.
Here men undeserv
ing the name forgot the dignity of their sex, and
propitiated the demon by their effeminate con
duct: here too unlawful commerce of women,
and adulterous intercourse, with other horrible
and infamous practices, were perpetrated in this
temple as in a place beyond the scope and re
straint of law.

Meantime these evils remained unchecked by
the presence of any observer, since no one of
fair character ventured to visit such scenes.
These proceedings, however, could not es
cape the vigilance of our august emperor,
who, having himself inspected them with char
acteristic forethought, and judging that such a
temple was unfit for the light of heaven, gave
orders that the building with its offerings should
be utterly destroyed.
Accordingly, in obedience
to the imperial edict, these engines of an impure
superstition were immediately abolished, and
the hand of military force was made instrumen
tal in purging the place. And now those who
had heretofore lived without restraint, learned,
through the imperial threat of punishment,
to practice self-control.
Thus did our
emperor tear the mask from this system of
delusive wickedness, and expose it to the public
gaze, at the same time proclaiming openly his
Saviour's name to all. No advocate appeared ;
neither god nor demon, prophet nor diviner,
could lend his aid to the detected authors of
the imposture.
For the souls of men were no
longer enveloped in thick darkness: but enlight
ened by the rays of true godliness, they deplored
the ignorance and pitied the blindness of their
forefathers, rejoicing at the same time in their

own deliverance from such fatal
error."
Thus speedily, according to the counsel
of the mighty God, and through our em
peror's agency, was every enemy, whether visible
or unseen, utterly removed : and henceforward
peace, the happy nurse of youth, extended her
reign throughout the world.
Wars were no
more, for the gods were not : no more did war
fare in country or town, no more did the effusion
of human blood, distress mankind, as hereto
fore, when demon-worship and the madness of
idolatry prevailed.

CHAPTER IX.

l

AND now we may well compare the present with former things, and review these
happy changes in contrast with the evils that are
past, and mark the elaborate care with which in
ancient times porches and sacred
precincts,
groves and temples, were prepared in every city
for these false deities, and how their shrines
were enriched with abundant offerings. The
sovereign rulers of those days had indeed a
high regard for the worship of the gods. The
nations also and people subject to their power
honored them with images both in the country
and in every city, nay, even in their houses and
secret chambers, according to the religious prac
tice of their fathers. The fruit, however, of this
devotion, far different from the peaceful con
cord which now meets our view, appeared in
war, in battles, and seditions, which harassed
them throughout their lives, and deluged their
countries with blood and civil slaughter.
Again, the objects of their worship could
hold out to these sovereigns with artful flat
tery the promise of prophecies, and oracles, and
the knowledge of futurity: yet could they not
predict their own destruction, nor forewarn them
selves of the coming ruin : and surely this was
the greatest and most convincing proof of
their imposture.
Not one of those whose
words once were heard with awe and won
der, had announced the glorious advent of the
Saviour of mankind,' or that new revelation of
divine knowledge which he came to give.
Not
Pythius himself, nor any of those mighty gods,
could apprehend the prospect of their approach
ing desolation; nor could their
oracles point at
him who was to be their conqueror and
destroyer.
What prophet or diviner could
foretell that their rites would vanish at the
presence of a new Deity in the world, and that
the knowledge and worship of the Almighty
Sovereign should be freely given to all mankind?

* "The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, l

thank thee that I am not as the rest of men."

He seems to disagree with the view of the heathen prophecy
which his imperial hearer maintained in his Oration to the Saints.

-

THE ORATION OF EUSEBIUS.

Which of them foreknew the august and pious
reign of our victorious emperor, or his trium
phant conquests everywhere over the false de
mons, or the overthrow of their high places?
Which of the heroes has announced the
melting down and conversion of the lifeless
statues from their useless forms to the necessary
uses of men? Which of the gods have yet had
power to speak of their own images thus melted
and contemptuously reduced to fragments?
Where were the protecting powers, that they
should not interpose to save their sacred
memorials, thus destroyed by man? Where, I
ask, are those who once maintained the strife of
war, yet now behold their conquerors abiding
securely in the profoundest peace? And where
are they who upheld themselves in a blind and
foolish confidence, and trusted in these vanities
as gods; but who, in the very height of their
superstitious error, and while maintaining an im
placable war with the champions of the truth,
perished by a fate proportioned to their
crimes? Where is the giant race whose
arms were turned against heaven itself; the
hissings of those serpents whose tongues were
pointed with impious words against the Almighty
King? These adversaries of the Lord of all, con
fident in the aid of a multitude of gods, advanced
to the attack with a powerful array of military
force, preceded by certain images of the dead,
and lifeless statues, as their defense. On the other
side our emperor, secure in the armor of godli
ness, opposed to the numbers of the enemy the
salutary and life-giving Sign, as at the same time
a terror to the foe, and a protection against
every harm; and returned victorious at once
over the enemy and the demons whom they
served." And then, with thanksgiving and praise,
the tokens of a grateful spirit, to the Author of
his victory, he proclaimed this triumphant Sign,
by monuments as well as words, to all mankind,
erecting it as a mighty trophy against every
enemy in the midst of the imperial city, and
expressly enjoining on all to acknowledge this
imperishable symbol of salvation as the safe
guard of the power of Rome and of the
empire of the world.
Such were the in
structions which he gave to his subjects
generally; but especially to his soldiers, whom
he admonished to repose their confidence, not
in their weapons, or armor, or bodily strength,
but to acknowledge the Supreme God as the
giver of every good, and of victory itself.
Thus did the emperor himself, strange and
incredible as the fact may seem, become
the instructor of his army in their religious ex
ercises, and teach them to offer pious prayers in

accordance with the divine ordinances, uplifting
their hands towards heaven, and raising their
mental vision higher still to the King of heaven,
on whom they should call as the Author of vic
tory, their preserver, guardian, and helper. He
commanded too, that one day should be regarded
as a special occasion for religious worship ;
mean that which is truly the first and chief of

Prescribing the same pious conduct to him
self, he honored his Saviour in the chambers
of his palace, performing his devotions accord
ing to the Divine commands, and storing his
mind with instruction through the hearing of the
sacred word. The entire care of his household
was intrusted to ministers devoted to the service
of God, and distinguished by gravity of life and
every other virtue ; while his trusty body-guards,

this the rites of superstitious fraud received a

crowning good of all, by erecting triumphant
memorials of its value in all parts of the world,
raising temples and churches on a scale of royal
costliness, and commanding all

Accordingly these signal proofs of our em

offspring, nor memorial of their existence among
men: for all, numerous as they were, disap
peared as in a moment beneath the stroke
of Divine vengeance.
Such, then, was the
fate which awaited these furious adversaries
of God: but he who, armed with the salutary
Trophy, had alone opposed them (nay rather,
not alone, but aided by the presence and the
power of him who is the only Sovereign), has
replaced the ruined edifices on a greater scale,
and made the second far superior to the first.
For example, besides erecting various churches
to the honor of God in the city which bears his
name, and adorning the Bithynian capital with
another on the greatest and most splendid scale,
he has distinguished the principal cities of the
other provinces by structures of a similar
kind.
Above all, he has selected two places
in the eastern division of the empire, the
one in Palestine (since from thence the life
giving stream has flowed as from a fountain for
the blessing of all nations), the other in that me
tropolis of the East which derives its name from
that of Antiochus ; in which, as the head of that
portion of the empire, he has consecrated to
the service of God a church of unparalleled
size and beauty. The entire building is encom
passed by an enclosure of great extent, within
which the church itself rises to a vast elevation,
of an octagonal
form, surrounded by many
chambers and courts on every side, and dec
orated with ornaments of the richest kind."

was once the seat of Hebrew sovereignty, on
the very site of the Lord's sepulchre, he has
raised
dimensions, and
adorned a temple sacred to the salutary Cross
with rich and lavish magnificence, honoring that
everlasting monument, and the trophies of the
Saviour's victory over the power of death, with
a splendor which no language can describe.
In the same country he discovered three
places venerable as the localities of three
sacred caves : and these also he adorned with
costly structures, paying a fitting tribute of rev
erence to the scene of the first manifestation of
the Saviour's presence; while at the second
cavern he hallowed the remembrance of his
final ascension from the mountain top ; and
celebrated his mighty conflict, and the victory
which crowned it, at the third."
All these
places our emperor thus adorned in the hope
of proclaiming the symbol of redemption to

all mankind; that Cross which has indeed repaid his pious zeal; through which
his house and throne alike have prospered, his
reign has been confirmed for a lengthened series
of years, and the rewards of virtue bestowed on
his noble sons, his kindred, and their de
scendants. And surely it is a mighty evi
dence of the power of that God whom
he serves, that he has held the balances of
justice with an equal hand, and has apportioned
to each party their due reward.
With regard
to the destroyers of the houses of prayer, the
penalty of their impious conduct followed hard
upon them : forthwith were they swept away,
and left neither race, nor house, nor family
behind.
On the other hand, he whose pious
devotion to his Lord is conspicuous in his every
act, who raises royal temples to his honor, and
proclaims his name to his subjects by sacred
offerings throughout the world, he, I say, has de
servedly experienced him to be the preserver
and defender of his imperial house and race.
Thus clearly have the dealings of God been
manifested, and this through the sacred efficacy
of the salutary Sign.

CHAPTER X.

MUCH might indeed be said of this salutary Sign, by those who are skilled in the
mysteries of our Divine religion.
For it is in
very truth the symbol of salvation, wondrous to
speak of, more wondrous still to conceive ; the
appearance of which on earth has thrown the
fictions of all false religion from the beginning
into the deepest shade, has buried superstitious
error in darkness and oblivion, and has revealed
to all that spiritual light which enlightens the
souls of men, even the knowledge of the
only true God. Hence the universal change
for the better, which leads men to spurn
their lifeless idols, to trample under foot the
lawless rites of their demon deities, and laugh
to scorn the time-honored follies of their fathers.
Hence, too, the establishment in every place of
those schools of sacred learning, wherein men
are taught the precepts of saving truth, and
dread no more those objects of creation which
are seen by the natural eye, nor direct a gaze
of wonder at the sun, the moon, or stars; but
acknowledge him who is above all these, that
invisible Being who is the Creator of them

are the blessings resulting to mankind from
this great and wondrous Sign, by virtue of which
the evils which once existed are now no more,
and virtues heretofore unknown shine every
where resplendent with the light of true
Discourses, and precepts, and
godliness.

emperor himself proclaims them : and it is in
deed a marvel that this mighty prince, raising
his voice in the hearing of all the world, like an
interpreter of the Almighty Sovereign's will,
invites his subjects in every country to the
knowledge of the true God. No more, as
in former times, is the babbling of impious
men heard in the imperial palace; but priests
and pious worshipers of God together celebrate
his majesty with royal hymns of praise. The
name of the one Supreme Ruler of the universe
is proclaimed to all : the gospel of glad tidings
connects the human race with its Almighty King,
declaring the grace and love of the heavenly
Father to his children on the earth. His praise is
everywhere sung in triumphant strains : the voice
of mortal man is blended with the har
mony of the angelic choirs in heaven; and
the reasoning soul employs the body which
invests it as an instrument for sounding forth
tribute of praise and adoration to
a fitting
his name. The nations of the East and the
West are instructed at the same moment in his
precepts:
the people of the Northern and
Southern regions unite with one accord, under
the influence of the same principles and laws,
in the pursuit of a godly life, in praising the one
Supreme God, in acknowledging his only be
gotten Son their Saviour as the source of every
blessing, and our emperor as the one ruler on
the earth, together with his pious sons.
He himself, as a skillful pilot, sits on high at
the helm of state, and directs the vessel with
unerring course, conducting his people as it
were with favoring breeze to a secure and tran
quil haven.
Meanwhile God himself, the great
Sovereign, extends the right hand of his power
from above for his protection, giving him vic
tory over every foe, and establishing his empire
by a lengthened period of years: and he will
bestow on him yet higher blessings, and confirm
in every deed the truth of his own promises.
But on these we may not at present dwell; but
must await the change to a better world : for it
is not given to mortal eyes or ears of flesh, fully
to apprehend the things of God."

this discourse, whose noble
argument is the glory of the Almighty King, let

sacred truth: not as presuming to instruct thee,

ena), one oration ends and another begins.

to thee those secret wonders which he himself,
not through the agency of man, but through our
common Saviour, and the frequent light of his
Divine presence has long since revealed and
unfolded to thy view: but in the hope of lead
ing the unlearned to the light, and displaying
before those who know them not the causes
True it is
and motives of thy pious deeds.
that thy noble efforts for the daily worship
and honor of the Supreme God throughout the
habitable world, are the theme of universal
praise.
But those records of gratitude to thy
Saviour and Preserver which thou hast dedicated
in our own province of Palestine, and in that
city from which as from a fountain-head the
Saviour Word" has issued forth to all mankind;
and again, the hallowed edifices and consecrated
temples which thou hast raised as trophies of
his victory over death; and those lofty and
noble structures, imperial monuments of an
imperial spirit, which thou hast erected in honor
of the everlasting memory of the Saviour's tomb;
the cause, I say, of these things is not equally
obvious to all.
Those, indeed, who are enlightened in heavenly knowledge by the
power of the Divine Spirit, well understand the
cause, and justly admire and bless thee for that
counsel and resolution which Heaven itself in
spired. On the other hand the ignorant and
spiritually blind regard these designs with open
mockery and scorn, and deem it a strange and
unworthy thing indeed that so mighty a prince
should waste his zeal on the graves and
monuments of the dead. "Were it not
better," such a one might say, "to cherish
those rites which are hallowed by ancient usage;
to seek the favor of those gods and heroes whose
worship is observed in every province ; instead
of rejecting and disclaiming them, because sub
ject to the calamities incident to man? Surely
they may claim equal honors with him who him
self has suffered : or, if they are to be rejected,
as not exempt from the sorrows of humanity,
the same award would justly be pronounced
respecting him."
Thus, with important and
contracted brow, might he give utterance in
self-imagined
his
pompous language to
wisdom.
Filled with compassion for this
ignorance, the gracious Word of our most
beneficent Father freely invites, not such a one
alone, but all who are in the path of error, to
receive instruction in Divine knowledge ; and
has ordained the means of such instruction
throughout the world, in every country and vil
lage, in cultivated and desert lands alike, and in
every city: and, as a gracious Saviour and Phy
sician of the soul, calls on the Greek and the
Barbarian, the wise and the unlearned, the rich

alike to draw near, and hasten to receive his
heavenly cure. And thus in time past had he
clearly announced to all the pardon of former
transgressions, saying, "Come unto me, all ye
that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest." And again, "I am not come
to call the righteous, but sinners, to repent
ance."* And he adds the reason, saying, "For
they that are whole need not a physician, but
they that are sick." And again, "I desire not
the death of a sinner, but rather that he
should repent." Hence it is only for those
who are themselves instructed in Divine
things and understand the motives of that zeal
of which these works are the result, to appre
ciate the more than human impulse by which
our emperor was guided, to admire his piety
toward God, and to believe his care for the
memorial of our Saviour's resurrection to be a
desire imparted from above, and truly inspired
by that Sovereign, to be whose faithful servant
and minister for good is his proudest boast.

testimony: and now let me commence my
appointed task.

Those who transfer the worship due to that
God who formed and rules the world to the
works of his hand ; who hold the sun and moon,
or other parts of this material system, nay, the
elements themselves, earth, water, air, and fire,

who give the name of gods to things which

CEGKL, sab. cop., etc.
It is worth noting that it is not in the Sina
itic, and if this text reading is correct it would nearly overthrow the
possibility that this MS. was one of those prepared under the direc
tion of Eusebius.

* Matt. xi. 12.

* Ezek. xviii. 23.

R. V. : "Have I any pleasure in the death of
the wicked, saith the Lord God: and not rather that he should

never would have had existence, or even name,
except as obedient to that Word of God who
made the world : such persons in my judgment
resemble those who overlook the master hand
which gives its magnificence to a royal palace;
and, while lost in wonder at its roofs and walls,
the paintings of varied beauty and coloring
which adorn them, and its gilded ceilings and
sculptures, ascribe to them the praise of that
skill which belongs to the artist whose work
they are: whereas they should assign the cause
of their wonder, not to these visible objects, but
to the architect himself, and confess that the
proofs of skill are indeed manifest, but that he
alone is the possessor of that skill who has
made them what they are.
Again, well
might we liken those to children, who
should admire the seven-stringed lyre, and dis
regard him who invented or has power to use
it: or those who forget the valiant warrior, and
adorn his spear and shield with the chaplet of
victory: or, lastly, those who hold the squares
and streets, the public buildings, temples, and
gymnasia of a great and royal city in equal honor
with its founder; forgetting that their admira
tion is due, not to lifeless stones, but to him
whose wisdom planned and executed these
mighty works.
Not less absurd is it for
those who regard this universe with the
natural eye to ascribe its origin to the sun, or
moon, or any other heavenly body.
Rather let
them confess that these are themselves the
works of a higher wisdom, remember the Maker
and Framer of them all, and render to him the
praise and honor above all created objects. Nay
rather, inspired by the sight of these very objects,
let them address themselves with full purpose of
heart to glorify and worship him who is now
invisible to mortal eye, but perceived by the
clear and unclouded vision of the soul, the
supremely sovereign Word of God. To take the
instance of the human body: no one has yet
conferred the attribute of wisdom on the eyes,
or head, the hands, or feet, or other members,
far less on the outward clothing, of a wise and
learned man: no one terms the philosopher's
household furniture and utensils, wise :
but
every rational person admires that invisible and
secret power, the mind of the man himself.
How much more, then, is our admiration
due, not to the visible mechanism of the
universe, material as it is, and formed of the self
same elements; but to that invisible Word who
has moulded and arranged it all, who is the only
begotten Son of God, and whom the Maker of
all things, who far transcends all being, has be
gotten of himself, and appointed Lord and
Governor of this universe?
For since it
was impossible that perishable bodies, or the
rational spirits which he had created, should

How else, consistently with his own holiness,
could he who is far above and beyond all things
unite himself to corruptible and corporeal mat

ON the other hand, the sacred doctrine
teaches that he who is the supreme Source
of good, and Cause of all things, is beyond all
comprehension, and therefore inexpressible by
word, or speech, or name; surpassing the power,
not of language only, but of thought itself. Un

heaven, nor in ethereal space, nor in any other
part of the universe; but entirely independent
of all things else, he pervades the depths of un

And now let us select an illustration from
our own experience. The invisible and un
discovered mind within us, the essential nature
of which no one has ever known, sits as a mon
arch in the seclusion of his secret chambers, and
alone resolves on our course of action. From
this proceeds the only-begotten word from its
father's bosom, begotten in a manner and by a
power inexplicable to us; and is the first mes

spring of a perfect Father, and the common
Preserver of all things, he diffuses himself with
living power throughout creation, and pours
from his own fullness abundant supplies of rea
son," wisdom, light, and every other blessing,
not only on objects nearest to himself, but on
those most remote, whether in earth, or sea,
or any other sphere of being. To all these
he appoints with perfect equity their limits,
places, laws, and inheritance, allotting to each
their suited portion according to his sovereign
will. To some he assigns the super-terrestrial
regions, to others heaven itself as their habita
tion: others he places in ethereal space, others
in air, and others still on earth. He it is who
transfers mankind from hence to another sphere,
impartially reviews their conduct here, and be
stows a recompense according to the life and
habits of each.
By him provision is made for
the life and food, not of rational creatures only,
but also of the brute creation, for the ser
vice of men; and while to the latter he
grants the enjoyment of a perishable and
fleeting term of existence, the former he invites
to a share in the possession of immortal life.
Thus universal is the agency of the Word of
God: everywhere present, and pervading all
things by the power of his intelligence, he
looks upward to his Father, and governs this
lower creation, inferior to and consequent upon
himself, in accordance with his will, as the
Intermecommon Preserver of all things.

* This conception that the Divine Word stands in something the

external) does to the human spirit has, at least, an interesting sug

lack of a better word, it is the ão just now to call a human per
sonality, and which certainly is made in the image and likeness of
God.
Unless there lurks in the idea some subtle heresy, one may
venture to accept as an interesting analogy this relation of invisible

diate, as it were, and attracting the created to
the uncreated Essence, this Word of God exists
as an unbroken bond between the two, uniting
things most widely different by an inseparable
tie. He is the Providence which rules the
universe;
the guardian and director of the
whole : he is the Power and Wisdom of God,
the only-begotten God, the Word begotten of
God himself.
For "In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.
All things were made by him ;
and without him was not anything made that
hath been made ''; as we learn from the words
of the sacred writer.'
Through his vivifying
power all nature grows and flourishes, refreshed
by his continual showers, and invested
with a vigor and beauty ever new.
Guiding
the reigns of the universe, he holds its on
ward course in conformity to the Father's will;
and moves, as it were, the helm of this mighty
ship.
This glorious Agent, the only-begotten
Son of the Supreme God, begotten by the
Father as his perfect Offspring, the Father has
given to this world as the highest of all goods;
infusing his word, as spirit into a lifeless body,
into unconscious nature; imparting light and
energy to that which in itself was a rude, inani
mate, and formless mass, through the Divine
power. Him therefore it is ours to acknowl
edge and regard as everywhere present, and
giving life to matter and the elements of na
ture: * in him we see Light, even the spiritual
offspring of inexpressible Light: one indeed in
essence, as being the Son of one Father; but
possessing in himself many and varied
powers. The world is indeed divided into
many parts; yet let us not therefore sup
pose that there are many independent Agents:
nor, though creation's works be manifold, let
us thence assume the existence of many gods.
How grievous the error of those childish and
infatuated advocates of polytheistic worship, who
deify the constituent parts of the universe, and
divide into many that system which is only
one !
Such conduct resembles theirs who
should abstract the eyes of an individual
man, and term them the man himself, and the
ears, another man, and so the head : or again,
by an effort of thought should separate the neck,
the breast and shoulders, the feet and hands,
or other members, nay, the very powers of
sense, and thus pronounce an individual to be
a multitude of men.
Such folly must surely be
Yet
rewarded with contempt by men of sense.
such is he who from the component parts of a
single world can devise for himself a multitude
of gods, or even deem that world which is the

work of a Creator, and consists of many parts,
to be itself a god : " not knowing that the Divine
Nature can in no sense be divisible into parts;
since, if compounded, it must be so through
the agency of another power; and that which
is so compounded can never be Divine. How
indeed could it be so, if composed of unequal
and dissimilar, and hence of worse and better
elements?
Simple, indivisible, uncompounded,
the Divine Nature exists at an infinite eleva
tion above the visible constitution of this
world. And hence we are assured by the
clear testimony of the sacred Herald,"
that the Word of God, who is before all things,
must be the sole Preserver of all intelligent
beings: while God, who is above all, and the
Author of the generation of the Word, being
himself the Cause of all things, is rightly called
the Father of the Word, as of his only-begotten
Son, himself acknowledging no superior Cause.
God, therefore, himself is One, and from him
proceeds the one only-begotten Word, the om
nipresent Preserver of all things. And as the
many-stringed lyre is composed of different
chords, both sharp and flat, some slightly, others
tensely strained, and others intermediate between
the two extremes, yet all attuned according to
the rules of harmonic art ; even so this material
world, compounded as it is of many elements,
containing opposite and antagonist principles, as
moisture and dryness, cold and heat, yet blended
into one harmonious whole, may justly be termed
a mighty instrument framed by the hand of God:
an instrument on which the Divine Word, him
self not composed of parts or opposing prin
ciples, but indivisible and uncompounded, per
forms with perfect skill, and produces a melody
at once accordant with the will of his Father the
Supreme Lord of all, and glorious to himself.
Again, as there are manifold external and in
ternal parts and members comprised in a single
body, yet one invisible soul, one undivided and
incorporeal mind pervades the whole; so is it
in this creation, which, consisting of many parts,
yet is but one : and so the One mighty, yea,

because they are not more, as well might he
complain that there are not many suns, or moons,
or worlds, and a thousand things beside; like
the madman, who would fain subvert the fair
and perfect course of Nature herself.
As in the
visible, so also in the spiritual world: in the one
the same sun diffuses his light throughout this
material earth; in the other the One Almighty
Word of God illumines all things with in
visible and secret power.
Again, there is
in man one spirit, and one faculty of reason,
which yet is the active cause of numberless
effects. The same mind, instructed in many
things, will essay to cultivate the earth, to build
and guide a ship, and construct houses: nay,
the one mind and reason of man is capable of
acquiring knowledge in a thousand forms: the
same mind shall understand geometry and as
tronomy, and discourse on the rules of grammar,
and rhetoric, and the healing art.
Nor will it
excel in science only, but in practice too : and
yet no one has ever supposed the existence of
many minds in one human form, nor expressed
his wonder at a plurality of being in man, be
cause he is thus capable of varied knowl
edge.
Suppose one were to find a shape
less mass of clay, to mould it with his hands,
and give it the form of a living creature; the
head in one figure, the hands and feet in an
other, the eyes and cheeks in a third, and so
to fashion the ears, the mouth and nose, the
breast and shoulders, according to the rules of
the plastic art. The result, indeed, is a variety
of figure, of parts and members in the one body;
yet must we not suppose it the work of many
hands, but ascribe it entirely to the skill of a
single artist, and yield the tribute of our praise
to him who by the energy of a single mind has
framed it all. The same is true of the universe
itself, which is one, though consisting of many
parts : yet surely we need not suppose many
creative powers, nor invent a plurality of gods.
Our duty is to adore the all-wise and all-perfect
agency of him who is indeed the Power and the
Wisdom of God, whose undivided force and
energy pervades and penetrates the universe,
creating and giving life to all things, and furnish

The same luminary constitutes the course of
time, governs the motions of the stars, performs

the circuit of the heavens, imparts beauty to the
earth, and displays the power of God to all :
and all this he performs by the sole and unaided
force of his own nature.
In like manner fire
has the property of refining gold, and fusing
lead, of dissolving wax, of parching clay, and
consuming wood ; producing these varied
effects by one and the same burning power.
So also the Supreme Word of God, per
vading all things, everywhere existent, every
where present in heaven and earth, governs and
directs the visible and invisible creation, the sun,
the heaven, and the universe itself, with an
energy inexplicable in its nature, irresistible in
its effects.
From him, as from an everlasting
fountain, the sun, the moon, and stars receive
their light: and he forever rules that heaven
which he has framed as the fitting emblem of his
own greatness. The angelic and spiritual powers,
the incorporeal and intelligent beings which
exist beyond the sphere of heaven and earth,

AND now let us proceed to explain the
reasons for which this mighty Word of God
descended to dwell with men.
Our ignorant
and foolish race, incapable of comprehending
him who is the Lord of heaven and earth, pro
ceeding from his Father's Deity as from the
Supreme fountain, ever present throughout the
world, and evincing by the clearest proofs his

not from giving the name of gods to the
very conceptions of their own minds, and the
speech by which those conceptions are ex
pressed ; calling the mind itself Minerva, and
language Mercury," and affixing the names of
Mnemosyne and the Muses to those faculties by
means of which science is acquired. Nor was
even this enough : advancing still more rapidly
in the career of impiety and folly, they deified
their own evil passions, which it behooved them
to regard with aversion, or restrain by the prin
ciples of self-control.
Their very lust and pas

thoughts of God to this corporeal and mortal
life, they deified their fellow-men, conferring the
names of gods and heroes on those who had
experienced the common lot of all, and vainly
imagining that the Divine and imperishable Es
sence could frequent the tombs and monuments
of the dead.
Nay, more than this: they paid
divine honors to animals of various species, and
to the most noxious reptiles: they felled trees,
and excavated rocks; they provided themselves
with brass, and iron, and other metals, of which
they fashioned resemblances of the male and
female human form, of beasts, and creeping
things; and these they made the objects of
their worship.
Nor did this suffice. To
the evil spirits themselves which lurked
within their statues, or lay concealed in secret
and dark recesses, eager to drink their libations,
and inhale the odor of their sacrifices, they as
cribed the same divine honors.
Once more,
they endeavored to secure the familiar aid of
these spirits, and the unseen powers which move
through the tracts of air, by charms of forbidden
magic, and the compulsion of unhallowed songs
and incantations.
Again, different nations have
adopted different persons as objects of their wor
ship. The Greeks have rendered to Bacchus,
Hercules, AEsculapius, Apollo, and others who
were mortal men, the titles of gods and heroes.
The Egyptians have deified Horus and Isis, Osi
ris, and other mortals such as these. And thus
they who boast of the wondrous skill whereby
they have discovered geometry, astronomy, and
the science of number, know not, wise as they
are in their own conceit, nor understand how to
estimate the measure of the power of God, or cal

culate his exceeding greatness above the na
ture of irrational and mortal beings. Hence
they shrank not from applying the name of
gods to the most hideous of the brute creation,
to venomous reptiles and savage beasts. The
Phoenicians deified Melcatharus, Usorus," and
others; mere mortals, and with little claim to
honor: the Arabians, Dusaris" and Obodas: the
Getae, Zamolxis: the Cicilians, Mopsus: and the
Thebans, Amphiaraus : " in short, each nation has
adopted its own peculiar deities, differing in no
respect from their fellow-mortals, being simply
and truly men.
Again, the Egyptians with one
consent, the Phoenicians, the Greeks, nay, every
nation beneath the sun, have united in worship
ing the very parts and elements of the world,
and even the produce of the ground itself.
And, which is most surprising, though acknowl
edging the adulterous, unnatural, and licentious
crimes of their deities, they have not only filled
every city, and village, and district with tem

have followed their evil example to the ruin
of their own souls. We hear of gods and

death, of mortal bodies here below. To such a

marched forth to battle. The Athenians record

not that at this day a human victim is offered in
Rome itself at the festival of Jupiter Lati
aris? And these facts are confirmed by the
testimony of the most approved philoso
phers.
Diodorus, the epitomizer of libraries,"
affirms that two hundred of the noblest youths
were sacrificed to Saturn by the Libyan people,
and that three hundred more were voluntarily
offered by their own parents.
Dionysius, the
compiler of Roman history," expressly says that
Jupiter and Apollo demanded human sacrifices

that on this demand they offered a proportion
of all their produce to the gods; but that, be
cause of their refusal to slay human victims, they
became involved in manifold calamities, from
which they could obtain no release until they
had decimated themselves, a sacrifice of life
which proved the desolation of their country.
Such and so great were the evils which of
old afflicted the whole human race. Nor
was this the full extent of their misery:
they groaned beneath the pressure of other evils
equally numerous and irremediable. All nations,
whether civilized or barbarous, throughout the

terrible disease: insomuch that the human family
was irreconcilably divided against itself; the
great system of society was distracted and torn
asunder; and in every corner of the earth men
stood opposed to each other, and strove with
fierce contention on questions of law and
government. Nay, more than this: with passions aroused to fury, they engaged in mutual
conflicts, so frequent that their lives were passed
as it were in uninterrupted warfare. None could
undertake a journey except as prepared
to
encounter an enemy: in the very country and
villages the rustics girded on the sword, pro
vided themselves with armor rather than with
the implements of rural labor, and deemed it a
noble exploit to plunder and enslave any
who belonged to a neighboring state.
Nay,
more than this: from the fables they had
themselves devised respecting their own deities,
they deduced occasions for a vile and abandoned
life, and wrought the ruin of body and soul by
licentiousness of every kind.
Not content with
this, they even overstepped the bounds which
nature had defined, and together committed in
credible and nameless crimes, "men with men
(in the words of the sacred writer) working un
seemliness, and receiving in themselves
that
recompense of their error which was due."
Nor did they stop even here ; but per
verted their natural thoughts of God, and
denied that the course of this world was directed
by his providential care, ascribing the existence
and constitution of all things to the blind oper
ation of chance, or the necessity of fate.
Once more : believing that soul and body
were alike dissolved by death, they led a
brutish life, unworthy of the name: careless of
the nature or existence of the soul, they dreaded
not the tribunal of Divine justice, expected no
reward of virtue, nor thought of chastise
ment as the penalty of an evil life.
Hence
it was that whole nations, a prey to wicked
ness in all its forms, were wasted by the effects
of their own brutality: some living in the prac
tice of most vile and lawless incest with mothers,
others with sisters, and others again corrupting
their own daughters.
Some were found who
slew their confiding guests; others who fed on
human flesh ; some strangled, and then feasted
on, their aged men; others threw them alive to
dogs. The time would fail me were I to attempt

AND now let us explain the cause for which
the incorporeal Word of God assumed this
mortal body as a medium of intercourse with
man.
How, indeed, else than in human form,
could that Divine and impalpable, that imma
terial and invisible Essence manifest itself to
those who sought for God in created and earthly
objects, unable or unwilling otherwise to dis
cern the Author and Maker of all things?
As a fitting means, therefore, of communi
cation with mankind, he assumed a mortal
body, as that with which they were themselves
familiar; for like, it is proverbially said, loves
its like. To those, then, whose affections were
engaged by visible objects, who looked for gods
in statues and lifeless images, who imagined the
Deity to consist in material and corporeal sub

divinity, the Word of God presented him

receives no stain from contact with dead and
impure bodies; much less can the incorporeal
power of the Word of God be injured in its
essential purity, or part with any of its greatness,
from spiritual contact with a human body.
Thus, I say, did our common Saviour prove
himself the benefactor and preserver of all,
displaying his wisdom through the instrumen
tality of his human nature, even as a musician
uses the lyre to evince his skill. The Grecian
myth tells us that Orpheus had power to charm
ferocious beasts, and tame their savage spirit,
by striking the chords of his instrument with a
master hand : and this story is celebrated by
the Greeks, and generally believed, that an un
conscious instrument could subdue the untamed
brute, and draw the trees from their places,
in obedience to its melodious power.
But he
who is the author of perfect harmony, the all
wise Word of God, desiring to apply every
remedy to the manifold diseases of the souls
of men, employed that human nature which is
the workmanship of his own wisdom, as an
instrument by the melodious strains of which
he soothed, not indeed the brute creation, but
savages endued with reason ; healing each furi
ous temper, each fierce and angry passion of
the soul, both in civilized and barbarous nations,
by the remedial power of his Divine doctrine.
Like a physician of perfect skill, he met the
diseases of their souls who sought for God in
nature and in bodies, by a fitting and kindred
remedy, and showed them God in human
form. And then, with no less care for the
body than the soul, he presented before
the eyes of men wonders and signs, as proofs
of his Divine power, at the same time instilling
into their ears of flesh the doctrines which he
himself uttered with a corporeal tongue.
In
short, he performed all his works through the
medium of that body which he had assumed for
the sake of those who else were incapable
of apprehending his Divine nature.
In all
this he was the servant of his Father's
will, himself remaining still the same as when
with the Father; unchanged in essence, unim
paired in nature, unfettered by the trammels of
mortal flesh, nor hindered by his abode in a
human body from being elsewhere present."

1 All these various conceptions of the Word are strictly Biblical:
(1) The Word the only revealer of the Father, who otherwise could
not be known; (2) The human body the temple of God; (3) The
indwelling Word.

* This ought to relieve Eusebius from any charge of Arianism in

6O4

CONSTANTINE.

Nay, at the very time of his intercourse
with men, he was pervading all things, was
with and in the Father, and even then was car
ing for all things both in heaven and earth.
Nor was he precluded, as we are, from being
present everywhere, or from the continued exer
cise of his Divine power. He gave of his own
to man, but received nothing in return : he
imparted of his Divine power to mortality, but
derived no accession from mortality itself.
Hence his human birth to him brought no
defilement; nor could his impassible Es
sence suffer at the dissolution of his mortal
body.
For let us suppose a lyre to receive an
accidental injury, or its chord to be broken ; it
does not follow that the performer on it suffers:
nor, if a wise man's body undergo punishment,
can we fairly assert that his wisdom, or the
soul within him, are maimed or burned.
Far less can we affirm that the inherent
power of the Word sustained any detriment
from his bodily passion, any more than, as in
the instance we have already used, the solar
rays which are shot from heaven to earth con
tract defilement, though in contact with mire
and pollution of every kind. We may, indeed,
assert that these things partake of the radiance
of the light, but not that the light is contami
nated, or the sun defiled, by this contact
with other bodies. And indeed these things
are themselves not contrary to nature; but
the Saviour, the incorporeal Word of God, being
Life and spiritual Light itself, whatever he touches
with Divine and incorporeal power must of ne
cessity become endued with the intelligence of
light and life.
Thus, if he touch a body, it be
comes enlightened and sanctified, is at once
delivered from all disease, infirmity, and suffer
ing, and that which before was lacking is
supplied by a portion of his fullness. And
such was the tenor of his life on earth; now
proving the sympathies of his human nature with
our own, and now revealing himself as the Word
of God: wondrous and mighty in his works as
God; foretelling the events of the far distant
future;
declaring in every act, by signs, and
wonders, and supernatural powers, that Word
whose presence was so little known ; and finally,
by his Divine teaching, inviting the souls of men
to prepare for those mansions which are above
the heavens.

CHAPTER XV.

WHAT now remains, but to account for
those which are the crowning facts of all ;
I mean his death, so far and widely known, the

this relation, however "dangerous" the ground he has trodden on
may be.

For the

manner of his passion, and the mighty miracle
of his resurrection after death ; and then to es
tablish the truth of these events by the clearest
testimonies?
reasons detailed
above he used the instrumentality of a
mortal body, as a figure becoming his
Divine majesty, and like a mighty sovereign
employed it as his interpreter in his intercourse
things consistently
with men, performing all
with his own Divine power.
Supposing, then,
at the end of his sojourn among men, he had
by any other means suddenly withdrawn himself
from their sight, and, secretly removing that in
terpreter of himself, the form which he had
assumed, had hastened to flee from death, and
afterwards by his own act had consigned his
mortal body to corruption and dissolution :
doubtless in such a case he would have been
deemed a mere phantom by all. Nor would
he have acted in a manner worthy of himself,
had he who is Life, the Word, and the Power of
God, abandoned this interpreter of himself
Nor, again, would

his warfare with the spirits of evil have re
ceived its consummation by conflict with the
power of death. The place of his retirement
must have remained unknown ; nor would his
existence have been believed by those who had
not seen him for themselves. No proof would
have been given that he was superior to death ;
nor would he have delivered mortality from
the law of its natural
His name
had never been heard throughout the world ;
nor could he have inspired his disciples with
contempt of death, or encouraged those who
embraced his doctrine to hope for the enjoy
ment of a future life with God.
Nor would he
have fulfilled the assurances of his own prom
ise, nor have accomplished the predictions of
the prophets concerning himself.
Nor would
he have undergone the last conflict of all; for
this was to be the struggle with the power
For all these reasons, then, and
of death.
inasmuch as it was necessary that the mortal
body which had rendered such service to the
Divine Word should meet with an end worthy

alternatives remained : either to consign his body
entirely to corruption, and so to bring the scene
of life to a dishonored close, or else to prove
himself victorious over death, and render mor
tality immortal by the act of Divine power; the
former of these alternatives would have con
travened his own promise.
For as it is not the
property of fire to cool, nor of light to darken,
no more is it compatible with life, to deprive of
life, or with Divine intelligence, to act in a man

ner contrary to reason.
consistent,with reason, that he who had promised

infirmity.

THE ORATION OF EUSEBIUS.

With reason,

life to others, should permit his own body, the
form which he had chosen, to perish beneath
the power of corruption?
That he who had
inspired his disciples with hopes of immortality,
should yield this exponent of his Divine
counsels to be destroyed by death? The
needful :
second alternative was therefore
I mean, that he should assert his dominion
over the power of death.
But how? should this
be a furtive and secret act, or openly performed
and in the sight of all? So mighty an achieve
ment, had it remained unknown and unrevealed,
must have failed of its effect as regards the inter
ests of men; whereas the same event, if openly
declared and understood, would, from its won
drous character, redound to the common benefit
of all.
therefore, since it was
needful to prove his body victorious over death,
and that not secretly but before the eyes of men,
he shrank not from the trial, for this indeed
would have argued fear, and a sense of inferiority
to the power of death, but maintained that con
flict with the enemy which has rendered mortal
a conflict undertaken for the
ity immortal ;
life, the immortality, the salvation of all.
Suppose one desired to show us that a ves
sel could resist the force of fire ; how could
he better prove the fact than by casting it into
the furnace and thence withdrawing it entire and
unconsumed P. Even thus the Word of God,
who is the source of life to all, desiring to prove
the triumph of that body over death which he
had assumed for man's salvation, and to make
this body partake his own life and immortality,
pursued a course consistent with this object.
Leaving his body for a little while," and deliver
ing it up to death in proof of its mortal nature,
he soon redeemed it from death, in vindication
of that Divine power whereby he has manifested
the immortality which he has promised to
be utterly beyond the sphere of death. The
It was needful that
reason of this is clear.
his disciples should receive ocular proof of the
certainty of that resurrection on which he had
taught them to rest their hopes as a motive for
rising superior to the fear of death.
It was
indeed most needful that they who purposed to
pursue a life of godliness should receive a clear
impression of this essential truth: more needful
still for those who were destined to declare his
name in all the world, and to communicate to
mankind that knowledge of God which he
had before ordained for all nations.
For
such the strongest conviction of a future life
was necessary, that they might be able with
fearless and unshrinking zeal to maintain the
conflict with Gentile and polytheistic error: a
conflict the dangers of which they would never

have been prepared to meet, except as habit
Accordingly,
uated to the contempt of death.
in arming his disciples against the power of this
last enemy, he delivered not his doctrines in
mere verbal precepts, nor attempted to prove
the soul's immortality, by persuasive and prob
able arguments; but displayed to them in his
own person a real victory over death. Such
was the first and greatest reason of our
Saviour's conflict with the power of death, where
by he proved to his disciples the nothingness of
that which is the terror of all mankind, and
afforded a visible evidence of the reality of that
life which he had promised ; presenting as it
were a first-fruit of our common hope, of future
life and immortality in the presence of God.
The second cause of his resurrection was,
that the Divine power might be manifested
which dwelt in his mortal body.
Mankind had
heretofore conferred Divine honors on men who
had yielded to the power of death, and had
given the titles of gods and heroes to mortals
For this reason, therefore, the
like themselves.
Word of God evinced his gracious character,
and proved to man his own superiority over
death, recalling his mortal body to a second life,
displaying an immortal triumph over death in
the eyes of all, and teaching them to acknowledge
the Author of such a victory to be the only
true God, even in death itself.
I may
allege yet a third cause of the Saviour's
death. He was the victim offered to the Supreme
Sovereign of the universe for the whole human
race : a victim consecrated for the need of the
human race, and for the overthrow of the errors
of demon worship.
For as soon as the one holy
and mighty sacrifice, the sacred body of our
Saviour, had been slain for man, to be as a
ransom for all nations, heretofore involved in
the guilt of impious superstition, thenceforward
the power of impure and unholy spirits was
utterly abolished, and every earth-born and
delusive error was at once weakened and
Thus, then, this salutary victim
destroyed.
taken from among themselves, I mean the
mortal body of the Word, was offered on behalf
of the common race of men.
This was that
sacrifice delivered up to death, of which the sa
cred oracles speak: "Behold the Lamb of God,
which taketh away the sin of the world." And
again, as follows: "He was led as a sheep to
the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer
is dumb." They declare also the cause, saying:
"He bears our sins, and is pained for us; yet
we accounted him to be in trouble, and in suffer
ing, and in affliction.
But he was wounded on
account of our sins, and bruised because of our
iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was

1 [These words (as Valesius observes) need not be too rigidly in

terpreted. - Bag.]

* John i. 29.

6O6

CONSTANTINE.

upon him; and by his bruises we were healed.
All we as sheep have gone astray; every one
has gone astray in this way; and the Lord gave

him up for our sins."

Such were the causes which led to the
offering of the human body of the Word of
God.
But forasmuch as he was the great high
priest, consecrated to the Supreme Lord and
King, and therefore more than a victim, the
Word, the Power, and the Wisdom of God;
he soon recalled his body from the grasp of
death, presented it to his Father as the first-fruit
of our common salvation, and raised this trophy,
a proof at once of his victory over death and
Satan, and of the abolition of human sacrifices,
for the blessing of all mankind.

CHAPTER XVI.

AND now the time is come for us to pro
ceed to the demonstration of these things;
if indeed such truths require demonstration, and
if the aid of testimony be needful to confirm the
certainty of palpable facts.
Such testimony,
however, shall be here given; and let it be
received with an attentive and gracious ear.
Of old the nations of the earth, the entire
human race, were variously distributed into
provincial, national, and local governments,'
subject to kingdoms and principalities of many
kinds. The consequences of this variety were
war and strife, depopulation and captivity, which
raged in country and city with unceasing fury.
Hence, too, the countless subjects of history,
adulteries, and rapes of women; hence the woes
of Troy, and the ancient tragedies, so known
among all peoples.
The origin of these
may justly be ascribed to the delusion of
polytheistic error.
But when that instrument of
our redemption, the thrice holy body of Christ,
which proved itself superior to all Satanic fraud,
and free from evil both in word and deed, was
raised, at once for the abolition of ancient evils,
and in token of his victory over the powers of
darkness; the energy of these evil spirits was at
once destroyed. The manifold forms of gov
ernment, the tyrannies and republics, the siege
of cities, and devastation of countries caused
thereby, were now no more, and one God
was proclaimed to all mankind.
At the
same time one universal power, the Roman
empire, arose and flourished, while the enduring
and implacable hatred of nation against nation
was now removed : and as the knowledge of

* [Isaiah liii. 4, 5, o Septuagint, English translation, p. 728.
P. 889 of the Bagster ed., 1879. i. the first reasons
- Bag. |
make one feel as if the author had been in danger of slighting the
atoning work of the Word, he here very clearly comes up, as usual,
to the i. position.

* Eparchies, ethnarchies, and toparchies.

one God, and one way of religion and salvation,
even the doctrine of Christ, was made known to
all mankind; so at the self-same period, the
entire dominion of the Roman empire being
vested in a single sovereign, profound peace
reigned throughout the world.
And thus, by
the express appointment of the same God, two
roots of blessing, the Roman empire, and the
doctrine of Christian piety, sprang up to
gether for the benefit of men.
For before
this time the various countries of the world,
as Syria, Asia, Macedonia, Egypt, and Arabia,
had been severally subject to different rulers.
The Jewish people, again, had established their
dominion in the land of Palestine. And these
nations, in every village, city, and district, actu
ated by some insane spirit, were engaged in
But
incessant and murderous war and conflict.
two mighty powers, starting from the same point,
the Roman empire, which
henceforth was
swayed by a single sovereign, and the Chris
tian religion, subdued and reconciled these
contending elements. Our Saviour's mighty
power destroyed at once the many govern
ments and the many gods of the powers of
darkness, and proclaimed to all men, both rude
and civilized, to the extremities of the earth, the
Meantime
sole sovereignty of God himself.
the Roman empire, the causes of multiplied
governments being thus removed, effected an
easy conquest of those which yet remained ; its
object being to unite all nations in one harmo
nious whole; an object in great measure already
secured, and destined to be still more perfectly
attained, even to the final conquest of the ends
of the habitable world, by means of the salutary
doctrine, and through the aid of that Divine
power which facilitates and smooths its way.
And surely this must appear a wondrous
fact to those who will examine the question
in the love of truth, and desire not to cavil at
these blessings." The falsehood of demon super
stition was convicted : the inveterate strife and
mutual hatred of the nations was removed : at
the same time One God, and the knowledge of
that God, were proclaimed to all : one universal
empire prevailed; and the whole human race,
subdued by the controlling power of peace and
concord, received one another as brethren, and
responded to the
feelings of their common
nature.
Hence, as children of one God and
Father, and owning true religion as their com
mon mother, they saluted and welcomed each
other with words of peace. Thus the whole
world appeared like one well-ordered and united
family: each one might journey unhindered as
far as and whithersoever he pleased : men might

are clearly confirmed.

securely travel from West to East, and from
East to West, as to their own native country: in
short, the ancient oracles and predictions of the
prophets were fulfilled, more numerous than we
can at present cite, and those especially which
speak as follows concerning the saving Word.
"He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and
from the river to the ends of the earth." And
again, "In his days shall righteousness spring
up ; and abundance of peace." "And they
shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and
their spears into sickles: and nation shall not
take up sword against nation, neither shall
they learn to war any more."
These
words, predicted ages before in the Hebrew
tongue, have received in our own day a visible
fulfillment, by which the testimonies of the

ceive it, not in words, but from the facts them

expand the gates of thought; pause awhile, and
inquire of thyself as though thou
consider;
wert another, and thus diligently examine the
nature of the case. What king or prince in any
age of the world, what philosopher, legislator,
or prophet, in civilized or barbarous lands, has
attained so great a height of excellence, I say
not after death, but while living still, and full
of mighty power, as to fill the ears and tongues
of all mankind with the praises of his name?
Surely none save our only Saviour has done
this, when, after his victory over death, he spoke
the word to his followers, and fulfilled it by the
event, saying to them, "Go ye, and make disci
ples of all nations in my name." " He it was
who gave the distinct assurance, that his gospel
must be preached in all the world for a testi
mony to all nations, and immediately verified
his word : for within a little time the world
itself was filled with his doctrine.
How,
then, will those who caviled at the com
mencement of my speech be able to reply to

is superior to any verbal argument. Who else
than he, with an invisible and yet potent hand,
has driven
from human society like savage
beasts that ever noxious and destructive tribe
of evil spirits who of old had made all nations
their prey, and by the motions of their images
had practiced many a delusion among men?
Who else, beside our Saviour, by the invocation
of his name, and by unfeigned prayer addressed
through him to the Supreme God, has given
power to banish from the world the remnant of

where Eusebius, with B. as against Aleph, adds something; but

those wicked spirits to those who with genuine
and sincere obedience pursue the course of life
and conduct which he has himself prescribed?
Who else but our Saviour has taught his fol
lowers to offer those bloodless and reasonable
sacrifices which are performed by prayer
and the secret worship of God? Hence is
it that throughout the habitable world altars
are erected, and churches dedicated, wherein
these spiritual and rational sacrifices are offered
as a sacred service by every nation to the One
Supreme God. Once more, who but he, with
invisible and secret power, has suppressed and
utterly abolished those bloody sacrifices which
were offered with fire and smoke, as well as the
cruel and senseless immolation of human vic
tims; a fact which is attested by the heathen

historians themselves?
the publication of the Saviour's Divine doctrine,
about the time of Hadrian's reign, that the
practice of human sacrifice was universally
abandoned.
Such and so manifest are the
proofs of our Saviour's power and energy
after death. Who then can be found of spirit
so obdurate as to withhold his assent to the
truth, and refuse to acknowledge his life to be
Divine P
Such deeds as I have described are
done by the living, not the dead; and visible
acts are to us as evidence of those which we
cannot see.
It is as it were an event of yester
day that an impious and godless race disturbed
and confounded the peace of human society,
and possessed mighty power.
But these, as
soon as life departed, lay prostrate on the earth,
worthless as dung, breathless, motionless, bereft
of speech, and have left
neither fame nor
memorial behind.
For such is the condition
of the dead; and he who no longer lives is
nothing: and how can he who is nothing be
capable of any act? But how shall his existence
be called in question, whose active power and
energy are greater than in those who are still
alive?

And though he be invisible
natural eye, yet the discerning faculty is not in
outward sense. We do not comprehend the
rules of art, or the theories of science, by bodily
sensation ; nor has any eye yet discerned the
mind of man.
Far less, then, the power of
God: and in such cases our judgment is
formed from apparent results.
Even thus
are we bound to judge of our Saviour's in
visible power, and decide by its manifest effects
whether we shall acknowledge the mighty opera
tions which he is even now carrying on to be
the works of a living agent; or whether they
shall be ascribed to one who has no existence ;
or, lastly, whether the inquiry be not absurd and
inconsistent in itself.
For with what reason can
we assert the existence of one who is not?
Since all allow that that which has no existence

6O8

CONSTANTINE.

is devoid of that power, and energy, and action,
for these are characteristics of the living, but
the contrary is characteristic of the dead.

CHAPTER XVII.

l

AND now the time is come for us to con
sider the works of our Saviour in our own
age, and to contemplate the living operations
of the living God.
For how shall we describe
these mighty works save as living proofs of the
power of a living agent, who truly enjoys the
life of God? If any one inquire the nature
of these works, let him now attend.
But
recently a class of persons, impelled by
furious zeal, and backed by equal power and
military force, evinced their enmity against God,
by destroying his churches, and overthrowing
from their foundations the buildings dedicated
to his worship.
In short, in every way they
directed their attacks against the unseen God,
and assailed him with a thousand shafts of
But he who is invisible
impious words.
avenged himself with an invisible hand. By
the single fiat of his will his enemies were
utterly destroyed, they who a little while before
had been flourishing in great prosperity, exalted
by their fellow men as worthy of divine honor,
and blessed with a continued period of power
and glory," so long as they had maintained
peace and amity with him whom they afterwards
opposed.
As soon, however, as they dared
openly to resist his will, and to set their gods
in array against him whom we adore ; immedi
ately, according to the will and power of that
God against whom their arms were raised, they
all received the judgment due to their audacious
deeds.
Constrained to yield and flee before
they acknowledged his
his power, together
Divine nature, and hastened to reverse the
measures which they had before essayed.
Our Saviour, therefore, without delay erected
trophies of this victory everywhere, and
once more adorned the world with holy temples
and consecrated houses of prayer; in every
city and village, nay, throughout all countries,
and even in barbaric wilds, ordaining the erec
tion of churches and sacred buildings to the
honor of the Supreme God and Lord of all.
Hence it is that these hallowed edifices are
deemed worthy to bear his name, and receive
not their appellation from men, but from the
Lord himself, from which circumstances they
of the
churches (or
are called
Lord)." And now let him who will stand

houses

to Diocletian, and others of the persecuting em

* [Kvptaxo~ how wrat Tov movvutov. The German "Kirche,"
Kirk, and the English "Church" are said, probably

the Scotch

forth and tell us who, after so complete a
desolation, has restored these sacred buildings
from foundation to roof? Who, when all hope
appeared extinct, has caused them to rise on a
nobler scale than heretofore? And well may it
claim our wonder, that this renovation was not
subsequent to the death of those adversaries of
God, but whilst the destroyers of these edifices
were still alive ; so that the recantation of their
evil deeds came in their own words and edicts."
And this they did, not in the sunshine of pros
perity and ease (for then we might suppose that
benevolence or clemency might be the cause),
but at the very time that they were suffering
under the stroke of Divine vengeance.
Who, again, has been able to retain in
obedience to his heavenly precepts, after
so many successive storms of persecution, nay,
in the very crisis of danger, so many persons
throughout the world devoted to philosophy,
and the service of God and those holy choirs
of virgins who had dedicated themselves to a
life of perpetual chastity and purity? Who
taught them cheerfully to persevere in the exer
cise of protracted fasting, and to embrace a life
of severe and consistent self-denial? Who has
persuaded multitudes of either sex to devote
themselves to the study of sacred things, and
prefer to bodily nutriment that intellectual food
which is suited to the wants of a rational soul?"
Who has instructed barbarians and peasants,
yea, feeble women, slaves, and children, in
short, unnumbered multitudes of all nations, to
live in the contempt of death; persuaded of
the immortality of their souls, conscious that
human actions are observed by the unerring eye
of justice, expecting God's award to the right
eous and the wicked, and therefore true to the
For they
practice of a just and virtuous life?
could not otherwise have persevered in the
course of godliness.
Surely these are the acts
which our Saviour, and he alone, even now per

topics, and endeavor by inquiries such as
these that follow to convince the objector's
obdurate understanding. Come forward, then,
whoever thou art, and speak the words of reason:
utter, not the thoughts of a senseless heart, but
those of an intelligent and enlightened mind:
speak, I say, after deep solemn converse with
thyself. Who of the sages whose names have
yet been known to fame, has ever been fore
known and proclaimed from the remotest ages,
as our Saviour was by the prophetic oracles to
But

THE ORATION OF EU SEBIUS.

his very birth-place, the period of his advent,
the manner of his life, his miracles, and words,
and mighty acts, were anticipated and recorded
in the sacred volumes of these prophets.
Again, who so present an avenger of crimes
against himself; so that, as the immediate
consequence of their impiety, the entire Jewish
people were scattered by an unseen power, their
royal
utterly removed, and their very
temple with its holy things levelled with the
ground? Who, like our Saviour, has uttered
predictions at once concerning that impious
establishment of his church
nation and the
throughout the world, and has equally verified
both by the event?
Respecting the temple of
these wicked men, our Saviour said: "Your
house is left unto you desolate '': " and, "There
shall not be left one stone upon another in this
place, that shall not be thrown down."" And
again, of his church he says: "I will build my
church upon a rock, and the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it."? How won
drous, too, must that power be deemed
which summoned obscure and unlettered men
from their fisher's trade, and made them the
legislators and instructors of the human race
And how clear a demonstration of his deity do
we find in the promise so well performed, that
he would make them fishers of men : in the
power and energy which he bestowed, so that
they composed and published writings of such
authority that they were translated into every
civilized and barbarous language," were read
and pondered by all nations, and the doc
trines contained in them accredited as the
oracles of God . How marvelous his pre
dictions of the future, and the testimony whereby
his disciples were forewarned that they should
be brought before kings and rulers, and should
endure the severest punishments, not indeed as
criminals, but simply for their confession of his
name ! Or who shall adequately describe the
power with which he prepared them thus to
suffer with a willing mind, and enabled them,
strong in the armor of godliness, to maintain a
constancy of spirit indomitable in the midst
Or how shall we enough
of conflict?
admire that steadfast firmness of soul which
strengthened, not merely his immediate followers,
but their successors also, even to our present
age, in the joyful endurance of every infliction,
and every form of torture, in proof of their
devotion to the Supreme God? Again, what
monarch has prolonged his government through
so vast a series of ages? Who else has power

For thus the mutual concord and harmony of
all nations coincided in point of time with the

God. The day itself would fail me, gracious

Divine power which even now are visible in
their effects; for no human being, in civilized

such power of Divine virtue as our Saviour.

Come forward, ye philosophers, and tell us what
god or hero has yet been known to fame, who
has delivered the doctrines of eternal life and a
heavenly kingdom as he has done who is our
Saviour 2 Who, like him, has persuaded multi
tudes throughout the world to pursue the prin
ciples of Divine wisdom, to fix their hope on
heaven itself, and look forward to the mansions
there reserved for them that love God? What
god or hero in human form has ever held his
course from the rising to the setting sun, a
course co-extensive as it were with the solar
light, and irradiated mankind with the bright
and glorious beams of his doctrine, causing
each nation of the earth to render united wor
ship to the One true God? What god or hero
yet, as he has done, has set aside all gods and
heroes among civilized or barbarous nations;
has ordained that divine honors should be with
held from all, and claimed obedience to that
command : and then, though singly conflicting
with the power of all, has utterly destroyed the
opposing hosts; victorious over the gods and
heroes of every age, and causing himself alone,
in every region of the habitable world, to be
acknowledged by all people as the only Son
of God? Who else has commanded the
nations inhabiting the continents and islands
of this mighty globe to assemble weekly on the
Lord's day, and to observe it as a festival, not
indeed for the pampering of the body, but for
the invigoration of the soul by instruction in
Divine truth? What god or hero, exposed, as
our Saviour was, to so sore a conflict, has raised

But why should we still vainly aim at detail
ing those Divine proofs of our Saviour's power
which no language can worthily express; which
need indeed no words of ours, but themselves
appeal in loudest tones to those whose mental
ears are open to the truth?
is a
strange, a wondrous fact, unparalleled in the
annals of human life; that the blessings we have
described should be accorded to our mortal
race, and that he who is in truth the only, the
eternal Son of God, should thus be visible on
earth.

For they terms the visible protection which your Divine

those particulars of his favor which are secret to
us, but known to you alone, and treasured in
your royal memory as in secret storehouses.
Such, doubtless, are the reasons, and such the
convincing proofs of your Saviour's power, which
caused you to raise that sacred edifice which
presents to all, believers and unbelievers alike,
a trophy of his victory over death, a holy temple
of the holy God: to consecrate those noble and

his name.
