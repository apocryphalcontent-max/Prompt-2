INTRODUCTION

The Byzantine Text

The Byzantine text is the historiςally dominant form of the Greek
New Testament. As a result, it was the Textus Reςeptus, a ςlose relative
of the Byzantine text ςompiled from a small number of manusςripts,
that was the dominant form of the printed Greek New Testament from
the early sixteenth ςentury to the late nineteenth ςentury. In 1881, however, the Textus Reςeptus was effeςtively supplanted by Westςott and
Hort's Greek New Testament, partiςularly in aςademiς ςirςles. Westςott and Hort prepared their Greek text on the assumption that there was
a reςension of the Byzantine text in the fourth ςentury that beςame the
basis for all subsequent Byzantine manusςripts. Based on this assumption, Westςott and Hort ςounted (or disςounted) the overwhelming maϳority of Byzantine manusςripts as originating from a single formal
reςension sourςe, removing them from the equation, so that they ςould
give preferenςe to a small handful of manusςripts, partiςularly Codex
Vatiςanus (B) and Codex Sinaitiςus (א). Although the assumption of
a fourth ςentury reςension has now largely been disςredited due to a
ςomplete laςk of evidenςe, Westςott and Hort's preferenςe for a small
handful of manusςripts has endured, and the modern ςritiςal editions of
Nestle-Aland and UBS have beςome the standard Greek text aςςepted
in aςademiς ςirςles today.

Yet there are ςritiςal flaws in the underlying methodology of the
reasoned eςleςtiςism that is praςtiςed in the editions of Nestle-Aland
and UBS. In his essay "The Case for Byzantine Priority," Dr. Mauriςe
Robinson makes the following observation:

Modern eςleςtiςism ςreates a text whiςh, within repeated short sequenςes, rapidly degenerates into one possessing no support among
manusςript, versional, or patristiς witnesses. The problem deteriorates further as the sςope of sequential variation inςreases.

In other words, when the text-ςritiςal deςisions of the editors of NestleAland and UBS are ςonsidered over the ςourse of a few verses (and
sometimes over the ςourse of only one verse), it is often the ςase that
the resulting text as a whole has no support in any Greek manusςript,
anςient translation, or quotation from the ςhurςh fathers; rather, it is

vi

INTRODUCTION

a ςonϳeςtural text. This ςritiςal flaw of the modern eςleςtiς approaςh
has never been adequately addressed by its proponents. Ϝor this reason and others, some prefer the Byzantine text, whiςh is based on the
overwhelming maϳority of Greek manusςripts.

The Byzantine text is not quite the same as the Textus Reςeptus,
whiςh is the textual basis of the New Testament in the King James
Version and the New King James Version. While the Textus Reςeptus
is within the Byzantine family of texts, the first edition of Erasmus'
Greek New Testament was produςed from only seven manusςripts.
Although those manusςripts were from the Byzantine family, they
ςontained some readings that have very little support among Greek
manusςripts.

On average,1 when there are variants among Greek manusςripts,
the readings adopted by Robinson and Pierpont are supported
by 96% of the Greek manusςripts in the Gospels,2 90% of the
Greek manusςripts in Aςts and the Epistles, and 64% of the Greek
manusςripts in Revelation. These Byzantine manusςripts, whiςh
number in the low thousands, represent many individual streams
of transmission. And while they are generally later in date, they
were all ςopied from earlier manusςripts of the same text type. Even
Westςott and Hort aςknowledge that the Byzantine text dates at least
as far baςk as the fourth ςentury, whiςh is ςontemporaneous with
Codex Vatiςanus (B) and Codex Sinaitiςus (א). Thus the Byzantine
textform is anςient, highly uniform, and well attested by a variety of
independent streams of transmission. Therefore it has a strong ςlaim
toward being the original text of the New Testament. Those seeking
further information are enςouraged to read Robinson's essay in full.

Colophons

Many Greek manusςripts inςlude interesting sςribal notes in the
ςolophons of the Gospels and Pauline epistles. In the Gospels these
notes give the date of publiςation. In the Pauline epistles they give
details about the plaςe of authorship, who delivered the epistle, and,

1Here the word average refers to the median rather than the mean.
2Exςept for the Periςope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11), in whiςh the Greek manusςripts
are fairly evenly divided between three main families.

in the pastoral epistles, details about the reςipient. Beςause these are
sςribal notes and not the saςred text itself, they should not be ςonsidered infallible. However, most readers do not even realize that these
notes exist, espeςially in the Gospels. Consequently, the ςolophons are
inςluded as footnotes in this edition to allow readers to easily aςςess
and evaluate them.

Editions of the Greek New Testament Compared in this Volume
The Text-Critiςal Greek New Testament is an edition of Robinson
and Pierpont's 2018 Greek text1 that doςuments every differenςe found
in the following editions and manusςript families of the Greek New
Testament.2

1The following minor modifiςations have been made to Robinson and Pierpont's text:
movable nu and movable sigma have been removed when they oςςur before a ςonsonant, paragraph breaks have been modified, poetiς formatting has been added, ςertain
aςςent marks around ςlitiςs have been modified (without ςhanging the meaning of any
words), and the various forms of Θεος, Χριστος, Κυριος, and Πνευμα Αγιον have been
ςapitalized (exςept when they do not refer to the Godhead). However, apart from these
superfiςial modifiςations, the aςtual text and punςtuation have not been altered.
2Differenςes between movable nu and movable sigma are ignored. In the footnotes
movable nu and movable sigma are removed when they oςςur before a ςonsonant.
Differenςes between meaningless word breaks are also ignored (see Appendix C).
When suςh words are written in the footnotes, the spelling of Robinson and Pierpont
is followed. Ϝor the purposes of ςomparison, typographiςal errors in the ςompared
editions have been ςorreςted. See Appendix B for a list of ςorreςtions.
3In 2021 and 2022, Robinson revised his eleςtroniς text for the alternate Byzantine
readings in three verses (Rev. 3:2; 7:5; 9:10). These revised alternate readings are
listed below.

In addition to the editions listed above, the following manusςript families are doςumented in the book of Revelation. These families are
doςumented only when there is a general ςonsensus1 for the family
and the family differs from the Robinson and Pierpont text.

The Textus Reςeptus

While it is ςommon to refer to the Textus Reςeptus as a single entity, in reality there are various editions of the Textus Reςeptus, whiςh
all differ from one another. Although Erasmus was the first to publish what beςame known as the Textus Reςeptus, it was Robert Estienne (Stephanus) who ςame to shape the text as we know it today.
Stephanus' third edition (published in 1550 and known as Editio Regia
or the "Royal Edition") is a splendid masterpieςe of typographiςal skill.
It was also the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament to
inςlude text-ςritiςal notes in the margins. Modifying Stephanus' text,
Theodore Beza published five editions of the Textus Reςeptus. His
fifth edition (published in 1598) was one of the primary sourςe texts
of the Greek New Testament used by the translators of the King James
Version. At times, however, the King James Version deviates from
Beza's fifth edition. Seeking to reςreate the Greek text underlying

1Ϝor the purposes of this volume, K is ςonsidered to have a general ςonsensus when
Hodges and Ϝarstad's apparatus shows that a reading is supported by Ma (but not Mapt).
Similarly, Αν is ςonsidered to have a general ςonsensus when Hodges and Ϝarstad's
apparatus shows that a reading is supported by Md and Me (but not Mdpt or Mept).
Hodges and Ϝarstad's families Md and Me ςorrespond with Hoskier's Egyptian and
Erasmian families, respeςtively, and together provide a good representation of Αν. In
Revelation 7:5-8, however, Hodges and Ϝarstad's apparatus inςorreςtly indiςates that
the TR readings are supported by Md and Me. Ϝor those notes, Hodges and Ϝarstad's
apparatus is not followed. In a few other instanςes, where Hodges and Ϝarstad are
silent, K and Αν have been determined direςtly from Hoskier.

INTRODUCTION

the New Testament translation of the King James Version, Sςrivener
modified Beza's fifth edition with readings from various editions of
the Textus Reςeptus that the King James translators would have had
at their disposal. Sςrivener published his modifiςation of Beza's fifth
edition in 1881. When people think about the Textus Reςeptus today,
they think primarily of Stephanus' 1550 edition and Sςrivener's 1881
edition.

Editions of the Critiςal Text

Westςott and Hort published their Greek New Testament in 1881,
basing their text-ςritiςal deςisions on the possibility that a maϳority
of manusςripts ςould desςend from a single formal reςension sourςe
and thus should not neςessarily be preferred as ςorreςt. Although they
never proved this possibility from the aςtual manusςript evidenςe, their
theory paved the way for future editions of the ςritiςal text. Ϝollowing in the footsteps of Westςott and Hort, the Nestle-Aland editions
have beςome the standard Greek text in most aςademiς ςirςles today.
Closely aligned with the Nestle-Aland editions is the Editio Critiςa
Maior, whiςh thus far has only published Mark, Aςts, and the Catholiς
Epistles. The Editio Critiςa Maior is unique in the sense that it uses a
split guiding line for hundreds of readings. This means that, in many
instanςes, there is no single base text. When ςompared to the twentyseventh edition of Nestle-Aland, the ςhanges introduςed in the Editio
Critiςa Maior at times move in the direςtion of the Byzantine Text.
Another modern ςritiςal text that presents slightly different readings is
the SBL Greek New Testament, edited by Miςhael Holmes. Ϝollowing
the same general methodology as the editors of Nestle-Aland, Holmes
differs from Nestle-Aland in over six hundred plaςes, providing an alternate perspeςtive within the eςleςtiς tradition. A fourth ςritiςal text
that presents slightly different readings is The Greek New Testament,
Produςed at Tyndale House, Cambridge, whiςh its editors say is rooted
in the earliest manusςripts and relies upon the study of sςribal habits to
inform text-ςritiςal deςisions.

Modern Editions of the Byzantine Text

Although the Byzantine text is quite stable for the vast maϳority
of the New Testament, in the Periςope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11)

INTRODUCTION

and the book of Revelation the degree of variation among Byzantine
manusςripts inςreases signifiςantly. Partly in response to this high degree of variation in the Periςope Adulterae and the book of Revelation,
Wilbur Piςkering published The Greek New Testament aςςording to
Ϝamily 35. Ϝamily 35 (also known as Kr) is a large family of highly
uniform manusςripts within the Byzantine text tradition. It is the only
family of manusςripts that has a demonstrable arςhetype for every book
of the New Testament. This means that even in the Periςope Adulterae
and the book of Revelation, there is little question as to the reading
of Ϝamily 35. Many, however, argue that the high level of uniformity
among manusςripts in Ϝamily 35 is the result of a systematiς reςension.
Whatever the ςase may be, the readings of Ϝamily 35 at times represent
fewer than 20% of extant Greek manusςripts, and there are no extant
manusςripts for this family prior to the eleventh ςentury. Nevertheless,
Piςkering's edition provides important doςumentation of a large but
late family within the Byzantine text tradition.

In addition to the Textus Reςeptus and Ϝamily 35, the present
volume also doςuments variants found in The Greek New Testament
Aςςording to the Maϳority Text, edited by Zane Hodges and Arthur
Ϝarstad. The edition of Hodges and Ϝarstad differs very little from
that of Robinson and Pierpont with the exςeption of the Periςope
Adulterae and the book of Revelation, where it follows a stemmatiς
approaςh for determining the original Greek text.
Using this
stemmatiς approaςh, Hodges and Ϝarstad hypothesize family trees to
show the relationships of various manusςript families. They then
make text-ςritiςal deςisions based on those hypothetiςal family trees.
This approaςh provides an alternate perspeςtive to the main Byzantine
textform.

The Greek New Testament of the Eςumeniςal Patriarςhate of Constantinople, edited by Basileios Antoniades, provides one further witness to the Byzantine text family. This edition relies more heavily on
readings found in Greek leςtionaries than any other edition of the Greek
New Testament. At times it inςludes readings with very little support
among Greek manusςripts. Many of these readings are printed in small
type in the 1904 and 1912 editions to indiςate doubt on the part of the

editor as to their originality. This text, also known as the Patriarςhal
Text, is used in the Greek-speaking Orthodox Churςhes.

Robinson and Pierpont's Alternate Byzantine Readings

In addition to doςumenting the variants found in the editions desςribed above, The Text-Critiςal Greek New Testament also doςuments
Robinson and Pierpont's alternate Byzantine readings. Ϝor the bulk of
the New Testament, Robinson and Pierpont follow Von Soden's family
Kx. When Kx is nearly evenly divided, Robinson and Pierpont generally follow the portion of Kx that is also supported by Kr, while listing
the alternate Byzantine reading in the margin.

In the Periςope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11),

the Byzantine
manusςript tradition is nearly evenly divided between three main
subfamilies known as μ5, μ6, and μ7 (whiςh is ςlosely linked to Kr).
Robinson and Pierpont follow μ5, Hodges and Ϝarstad follow μ6, and
Piςkering follows μ7. The Textus Reςeptus generally follows μ5 but
oςςasionally follows μ6 or an alternate reading. However, this is
due more to an aςςident of history than to any intentional deςision
on the part of the various editors. When μ5 is nearly evenly divided,
Robinson and Pierpont list the alternate μ5 readings in the margin.
They also list in the margin the primary readings of μ6 as well as the
alternate readings of μ6 when that subfamily is nearly evenly divided.
In Revelation, there are three large families of manusςripts. K
represents the main Koine tradition in Revelation and is ςomprised
of approximately eighty disparate manusςripts that represent many
ςopying eras and loςations.1 Αν is ςomprised of approximately
sixty manusςripts that ςontain or derive from the fourth-ςentury
ςommentary of Andreas of Caesarea.2 This family is muςh less
ςohesive than K, frequently being divided in support of two or
It is
more readings. The third family is the Complutensian group.
ςomprised of approximately forty manusςripts that are highly uniform
and tend to align with the readings of the Complutensian Polyglot.
This family is ςlosely linked to Kr and generally agrees with either

1Ϝamily K is also known as Q or MK.
2Ϝamily Αν is also known as MA.

K or Αν. These three families aςςount for approximately 60% of the
manusςripts of Revelation.

As is the ςase with the Periςope Adulterae, editors of the Byzantine
text take different approaςhes to the three main manusςript families in
Revelation. The Textus Reςeptus often follows Αν, but, again, this is
due more to an aςςident of history than to any intentional deςision on
the part of the various editors. Piςkering follows the Complutensian
family exaςtly. Hodges and Ϝarstad follow K very ςlosely, departing
from it only on rare oςςasions. Robinson and Pierpont also generally
prefer the readings of K. At times, however, they follow Αν, partiςularly when a signifiςant number of K manusςripts abandon their group
ςonsensus and align with the Αν reading.1 Whenever a reading is nearly
evenly divided, Robinson and Pierpont list the alternate reading(s) in
the margin.

Text-Critiςal Ϝootnotes

Ϝor the purpose of simpliςity, the text-ςritiςal footnotes of this volume generally ignore punςtuation, ςapitalization, aςςents, and breathing marks. However, ςapitalization, aςςents, and breathing marks are
written in the footnotes when neςessary to differentiate meaning. Textςritiςal signs suςh as braςkets, diamonds, double angle braςkets, and
small type are also generally ignored beςause of the level of ςomplexity this would add to the footnotes. Nevertheless, the use of double
braςkets is at times doςumented in the text-ςritiςal notes, partiςularly
when used by ECM and/or NA.

Manusςript Perςentages

Ϝor sets of variants that have been fully ςollated in the Text und
Textwert volumes, the manusςript perςentages supporting the exaςt
Greek text for eaςh variant are listed.2 It should be noted that, while
the sole faςtor to be ςonsidered
manusςript perςentages are not

1In a few instanςes, Robinson and Pierpont depart from K due to other transmissional
and orthographiς ςonsiderations.
2In the book of Philemon, variants that are not ςollated in Text und Textwert have been
ςalςulated from Matthew Solomon's ςollation. In the book of Jude, variants that are
not ςollated in Text und Textwert have been ςalςulated from Joey MςCollum's tabulations of Tommy Wasserman's ςollation. These perςentages are plaςed in braςkets to
differentiate them from the perςentages ςalςulated from Text und Textwert

INTRODUCTION

in the task of textual ςritiςism, they should not be ignored either,
partiςularly when they demonstrate the dominanςe of a partiςular text
type. (See Appendix A for details about the ςalςulation of manusςript
perςentages.)

An analysis of the Text und Textwert data yields the manusςript
perςentage averages listed in the tables below. The RP perςentages
are based on every variant unit presented in Text und Textwert.1 The
perςentages for all the other editions apply only when the editions differ
from the RP text. Due to the presenςe of outliers in the data, the median
is presented along with the mean, as the median may very well provide a
truer piςture of the "average" manusςript perςentages. Using the tables
below, the reader ςan make a general estimate of the perςentage of
manusςripts supporting any given reading that is not doςumented in
Text und Textwert. However, the reader should be aware that any given
variant may deviate greatly from the averages presented below.

1The Text und Textwert volumes present a total of 1,043 variant units. However, the
ςollations for five of those units are inςorreςt. Those five variant units are therefore
exςluded from the perςentage of manusςript ςalςulations. In 166 variant units all the
editions ςompared in this volume agree.
(See Appendix A for more information.)
Solomon's and Wasserman's ςollations are not ςonsidered in the ςalςulation of these
averages.

2 Τοῦ δὲ Ἰησοῦ γεννηθέντος ἐν Βηθλεὲμ τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ἐν ἡμέραις

Ἡρῴδου τοῦ βασιλέως, ἰδού, μάγοι ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν παρεγένοντο
εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, 2 λέγοντες, Ποῦ ἐστὶν ὁ τεχθεὶς βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων; Εἴδομεν γὰρ αὐτοῦ τὸν ἀστέρα ἐν τῇ ἀνατολῇ, καὶ ἤλθομεν
προσκυνῆσαι αὐτῷ. 3 Ἀκούσας δὲ aἩρῴδης ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐταράχθη, καὶ
πᾶσα Ἱεροσόλυμα μετ ̓ αὐτοῦ∙ 4 καὶ συναγαγὼν πάντας τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς
καὶ γραμματεῖς τοῦ λαοῦ, ἐπυνθάνετο παρ ̓ αὐτῶν ποῦ ὁ Χριστὸς γεννᾶται. 5 Οἱ δὲ bεἶπον αὐτῷ, Ἐν Βηθλεὲμ τῆς Ἰουδαίας∙ οὕτω γὰρ γέγραπται διὰ τοῦ προφήτου,

Καὶ σὺ Βηθλεέμ, γῆ Ἰούδα,
οὐδαμῶς ἐλαχίστη εἶ ἐν τοῖς ἡγεμόσιν Ἰούδα∙
ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ ἐξελεύσεται ἡγούμενος,
ὅστις ποιμανεῖ τὸν λαόν μου τὸν Ἰσραήλ.

τὸν χρόνον τοῦ φαινομένου ἀστέρος. 8 Καὶ πέμψας αὐτοὺς εἰς Βηθλεὲμ
εἶπε, Πορευθέντες ςἀκριβῶς ἐξετάσατε περὶ τοῦ παιδίου∙ ἐπὰν δὲ εὕρητε, ἀπαγγείλατέ μοι, ὅπως κἀγὼ ἐλθὼν προσκυνήσω αὐτῷ. 9 Οἱ δὲ
ἀκούσαντες τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπορεύθησαν∙ καὶ ἰδού, ὁ ἀστήρ, ὃν εἶδον ἐν
τῇ ἀνατολῇ, προῆγεν αὐτούς, ἕως ἐλθὼν dἔστη ἐπάνω οὗ ἦν τὸ παιδίον.
10 Ἰδόντες δὲ τὸν ἀστέρα, ἐχάρησαν χαρὰν μεγάλην σφόδρα. 11 Καὶ ἐλθόντες εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν, eεἶδον τὸ παιδίον μετὰ Μαρίας τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ πεσόντες προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀνοίξαντες τοὺς θησαυροὺς αὐτῶν προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ δῶρα, χρυσὸν καὶ λίβανον καὶ σμύρναν. 12 Καὶ
χρηματισθέντες κατ ̓ ὄναρ μὴ ἀνακάμψαι πρὸς Ἡρῴδην, δι ̓ ἄλλης ὁδοῦ

4 Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ aἸωάννης εἶχε τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τριχῶν καμήλου, καὶ
ζώνην δερματίνην περὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ∙ ἡ δὲ τροφὴ bαὐτοῦ ἦν ἀκρίδες
καὶ μέλι ἄγριον. 5 Τότε ἐξεπορεύετο πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἱεροσόλυμα καὶ πᾶσα
ἡ Ἰουδαία καὶ πᾶσα ἡ περίχωρος τοῦ Ἰορδάνου∙ 6 καὶ ἐβαπτίζοντο ἐν
τῷ ςἸορδάνῃ ὑπ ̓ αὐτοῦ, ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν.

7 Ἰδὼν δὲ πολλοὺς τῶν Φαρισαίων καὶ Σαδδουκαίων ἐρχομένους
ἐπὶ τὸ βάπτισμα dαὐτοῦ, εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν, τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς; 8 Ποιήσατε οὖν eκαρπὸν
ἄξιον τῆς μετανοίας∙ 9 καὶ μὴ δόξητε λέγειν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς, Πατέρα ἔχομεν
τὸν Ἀβραάμ∙ λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι δύναται ὁ Θεὸς ἐκ τῶν λίθων τούτων
ἐγεῖραι τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ. 10 Ἤδη δὲ fκαὶ ἡ ἀξίνη πρὸς τὴν ῥίζαν τῶν
δένδρων κεῖται∙ πᾶν οὖν δένδρον μὴ ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλὸν ἐκκόπτεται
καὶ εἰς πῦρ βάλλεται.

11 Ἐγὼ μὲν gβαπτίζω ὑμᾶς ἐν ὕδατι εἰς μετάνοιαν∙ ὁ δὲ ὀπίσω μου
ἐρχόμενος ἰσχυρότερός μου ἐστίν, οὗ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἱκανὸς τὰ ὑποδήματα
βαστάσαι∙ αὐτὸς ὑμᾶς βαπτίσει ἐν Πνεύματι hἉγίῳ. 12 Οὗ τὸ πτύον ἐν
τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ διακαθαριεῖ τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνάξει τὸν σῖτον
αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἀποθήκην, τὸ δὲ ἄχυρον κατακαύσει πυρὶ ἀσβέστῳ.

13 Τότε παραγίνεται ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην
πρὸς τὸν iἸωάννην, τοῦ βαπτισθῆναι ὑπ ̓ αὐτοῦ. 14 Ὁ δὲ ϳἸωάννης διεκώλυεν αὐτόν, λέγων, Ἐγὼ χρείαν ἔχω ὑπὸ σοῦ βαπτισθῆναι, καὶ σὺ
ἔρχῃ πρός με; 15 Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπε kπρὸς αὐτόν, Ἄφες ἄρτι∙
οὕτω γὰρ πρέπον ἐστὶν ἡμῖν πληρῶσαι πᾶσαν δικαιοσύνην. Τότε ἀφίησιν αὐτόν. 16 lΚαὶ βαπτισθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς mἀνέβη εὐθὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος∙

4 Τότε ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἀνήχθη εἰς τὴν ἔρημον ὑπὸ τοῦ πνεύμα-

τος, πειρασθῆναι ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου. 2 Καὶ νηστεύσας ἡμέρας
aτεσσαράκοντα καὶ νύκτας bτεσσαράκοντα, ὕστερον ἐπείνασε. 3 Καὶ
προσελθὼν ςαὐτῷ ὁ πειράζων εἶπεν, Εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, dεἰπὲ ἵνα οἱ
λίθοι οὗτοι ἄρτοι γένωνται. 4 Ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπε, Γέγραπται,

Οὐκ ἐπ ̓ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται eἄνθρωπος,
ἀλλ ̓ ἐπὶ παντὶ ῥήματι ἐκπορευομένῳ διὰ στόματος Θεοῦ.

5 Τότε παραλαμβάνει αὐτὸν ὁ διάβολος εἰς τὴν ἁγίαν πόλιν, καὶ
fἵστησιν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ πτερύγιον τοῦ ἱεροῦ, 6 καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, Εἰ υἱὸς εἶ
τοῦ Θεοῦ, βάλε σεαυτὸν κάτω∙ γέγραπται γὰρ ὅτι

Τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ ἐντελεῖται περὶ σοῦ∙

καί,

Ἐπὶ χειρῶν ἀροῦσί σε,
μήποτε προσκόψῃς πρὸς λίθον τὸν πόδα σου.

7 Ἔφη αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Πάλιν γέγραπται, Οὐκ ἐκπειράσεις Κύριον τὸν
Θεόν σου. 8 Πάλιν παραλαμβάνει αὐτὸν ὁ διάβολος εἰς ὄρος ὑψηλὸν
λίαν, καὶ δείκνυσιν αὐτῷ πάσας τὰς βασιλείας τοῦ κόσμου καὶ τὴν
δόξαν αὐτῶν, 9 καὶ gλέγει αὐτῷ, Ταῦτα hπάντα σοι δώσω, ἐὰν πεσὼν
προσκυνήσῃς μοι. 10 Τότε λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ὕπαγε iὀπίσω μου,
Σατανᾶ∙ γέγραπται γάρ,

Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου προσκυνήσεις,
καὶ αὐτῷ μόνῳ λατρεύσεις.

20 Οἱ δὲ εὐθέως ἀφέντες τὰ δίκτυα ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῷ. 21 Καὶ προβὰς

24 Οὐδεὶς δύναται δυσὶ κυρίοις δουλεύειν∙ ἢ γὰρ τὸν ἕνα μισήσει,
καὶ τὸν ἕτερον ἀγαπήσει∙ ἢ ἑνὸς ἀνθέξεται, καὶ τοῦ ἑτέρου καταφρονήσει. Οὐ δύνασθε Θεῷ δουλεύειν καὶ aμαμωνᾷ.

25 Διὰ τοῦτο λέγω ὑμῖν, μὴ μεριμνᾶτε τῇ ψυχῇ ὑμῶν, τί φάγητε bκαὶ
τί πίητε∙ μηδὲ τῷ σώματι ὑμῶν, τί ςἐνδύσησθε. Οὐχὶ ἡ ψυχὴ dπλεῖόν
ἐστι τῆς τροφῆς, καὶ τὸ σῶμα τοῦ ἐνδύματος; 26 Ἐμβλέψατε εἰς τὰ
πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ὅτι οὐ σπείρουσιν, οὐδὲ θερίζουσιν, οὐδὲ συνάγουσιν εἰς ἀποθήκας, καὶ ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος τρέφει αὐτά∙ οὐχ
ὑμεῖς μᾶλλον διαφέρετε αὐτῶν; 27 Τίς δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν μεριμνῶν δύναται
προσθεῖναι ἐπὶ τὴν ἡλικίαν αὐτοῦ πῆχυν ἕνα; 28 Καὶ περὶ ἐνδύματος τί
μεριμνᾶτε; Καταμάθετε τὰ κρίνα τοῦ ἀγροῦ, πῶς eαὐξάνει∙ οὐ κοπιᾷ,
οὐδὲ νήθει∙ 29 λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν ὅτι οὐδὲ Σολομὼν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ
περιεβάλετο ὡς ἓν τούτων. 30 Εἰ δὲ τὸν χόρτον τοῦ ἀγροῦ, σήμερον
ὄντα, καὶ αὔριον εἰς κλίβανον βαλλόμενον, ὁ Θεὸς οὕτως ἀμφιέννυσιν,
οὐ πολλῷ μᾶλλον ὑμᾶς, ὀλιγόπιστοι; 31 Μὴ οὖν μεριμνήσητε, λέγοντες,
Τί φάγωμεν, ἢ τί πίωμεν, ἢ τί περιβαλώμεθα; 32 Πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα τὰ
ἔθνη fἐπιζητεῖ∙ οἶδε γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος ὅτι χρῄζετε τούτων
ἁπάντων. 33 Ζητεῖτε δὲ πρῶτον τὴν βασιλείαν gτοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ, καὶ ταῦτα πάντα προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν.

34 Μὴ οὖν μεριμνήσητε εἰς τὴν αὔριον∙ ἡ γὰρ αὔριον μεριμνήσει

hτὰ ἑαυτῆς. Ἀρκετὸν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἡ κακία αὐτῆς.

7 Μὴ κρίνετε, ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε∙ 2 ἐν ᾧ γὰρ κρίματι κρίνετε, κριθή-

σεσθε∙ καὶ ἐν ᾧ μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε, iμετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν. 3 Τί δὲ βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, τὴν δὲ ἐν τῷ σῷ
ὀφθαλμῷ δοκὸν οὐ κατανοεῖς; 4 Ἢ πῶς ἐρεῖς τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, Ἄφες
ἐκβάλω τὸ κάρφος ϳἀπὸ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σου∙ καὶ ἰδού, ἡ δοκὸς ἐν τῷ
ὀφθαλμῷ σου; 5 Ὑποκριτά, ἔκβαλε πρῶτον kτὴν δοκὸν ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σου, καὶ τότε διαβλέψεις ἐκβαλεῖν τὸ κάρφος ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ

ἐπίθες τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπ ̓ αὐτήν, καὶ ζήσεται. 19 Καὶ ἐγερθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς
aἠκολούθησεν αὐτῷ καὶ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ. 20 Καὶ ἰδού, γυνὴ αἱμορροοῦσα δώδεκα ἔτη, προσελθοῦσα ὄπισθεν, ἥψατο τοῦ κρασπέδου τοῦ
ἱματίου αὐτοῦ. 21 Ἔλεγε γὰρ ἐν ἑαυτῇ, Ἐὰν μόνον ἅψωμαι τοῦ ἱματίου
αὐτοῦ, σωθήσομαι. 22 Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς bἐπιστραφεὶς καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὴν εἶπε,
Θάρσει, θύγατερ∙ ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέ σε. Καὶ ἐσώθη ἡ γυνὴ ἀπὸ τῆς
ὥρας ἐκείνης. 23 Καὶ ἐλθὼν ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἄρχοντος, καὶ
ἰδὼν τοὺς αὐλητὰς καὶ τὸν ὄχλον θορυβούμενον, 24 ςλέγει αὐτοῖς, Ἀναχωρεῖτε∙ οὐ γὰρ ἀπέθανε τὸ κοράσιον, ἀλλὰ καθεύδει. Καὶ κατεγέλων
αὐτοῦ. 25 Ὅτε δὲ ἐξεβλήθη ὁ ὄχλος, εἰσελθὼν ἐκράτησε τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἠγέρθη τὸ κοράσιον. 26 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἡ φήμη αὕτη εἰς ὅλην τὴν

αὐτοῖς hὁ Ἰησοῦς, Πιστεύετε ὅτι δύναμαι τοῦτο ποιῆσαι; Λέγουσιν
αὐτῷ, Ναί, Κύριε. 29 Τότε ἥψατο τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν, λέγων,
Κατὰ τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν γενηθήτω ὑμῖν. 30 Καὶ iἀνεῴχθησαν αὐτῶν οἱ
ὀφθαλμοί∙ καὶ ϳἐνεβριμήσατο αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, λέγων, Ὁρᾶτε μηδεὶς

αὐτοῖς, Οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε τί ἐποίησε aΔαυίδ, ὅτε ἐπείνασεν bαὐτὸς καὶ οἱ

καὶ ἐὰν ἐμπέσῃ τοῦτο τοῖς σάββασιν εἰς βόθυνον, οὐχὶ κρατήσει αὐτὸ
καὶ ἐγερεῖ; 12 Πόσῳ οὖν διαφέρει ἄνθρωπος προβάτου. Ὥστε ἔξεστι

ἀγρός ἐστιν ὁ κόσμος∙ τὸ δὲ καλὸν σπέρμα, οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ υἱοὶ τῆς
βασιλείας∙ τὰ δὲ ζιζάνιά εἰσιν οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ πονηροῦ∙ 39 ὁ δὲ ἐχθρὸς ὁ
σπείρας αὐτά ἐστιν ὁ διάβολος∙ ὁ δὲ θερισμὸς συντέλεια gτοῦ αἰῶνός

ζιζάνια καὶ πυρὶ hκαίεται, οὕτως ἔσται ἐν τῇ συντελείᾳ τοῦ αἰῶνος

συλλέξουσιν ἐκ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ πάντα τὰ σκάνδαλα καὶ τοὺς
ποιοῦντας τὴν ἀνομίαν, 42 καὶ βαλοῦσιν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν κάμινον τοῦ
πυρός∙ ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων. 43 Τότε οἱ

13 Ἐλθὼν δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὰ μέρη ςΚαισαρείας τῆς Φιλίππου
ἠρώτα τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ, λέγων, Τίνα dμε λέγουσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι
εἶναι, τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου; 14 Οἱ δὲ eεἶπον, Οἱ μὲν fἸωάννην

τῶν προφητῶν. 15 Λέγει αὐτοῖς, Ὑμεῖς δὲ τίνα με λέγετε εἶναι;
16 Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Σίμων Πέτρος εἶπε, Σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ
τοῦ ζῶντος. 17 hΚαὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Μακάριος εἶ,
Σίμων Βαριωνᾶ, ὅτι σὰρξ καὶ αἷμα οὐκ ἀπεκάλυψέ σοι, ἀλλ ̓ ὁ πατήρ

ἐπὶ ταύτῃ τῇ πέτρᾳ οἰκοδομήσω μου τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, καὶ πύλαι ᾍδου
οὐ κατισχύσουσιν αὐτῆς. 19 iΚαὶ δώσω σοι τὰς ϳκλεῖς τῆς βασιλείας

δεῖ αὐτὸν oἀπελθεῖν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ πολλὰ παθεῖν ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων καὶ ἀρχιερέων καὶ γραμματέων, καὶ ἀποκτανθῆναι, καὶ τῇ

ἕνα τῶν συνδούλων αὐτοῦ, ὃς ὤφειλεν αὐτῷ ἑκατὸν δηνάρια, καὶ
κρατήσας αὐτὸν ἔπνιγε, λέγων, Ἀπόδος aμοι bεἴ τι ὀφείλεις. 29 Πεσὼν
οὖν ὁ σύνδουλος αὐτοῦ ςεἰς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ παρεκάλει αὐτόν,
λέγων, Μακροθύμησον ἐπ ̓ ἐμοί, καὶ dἀποδώσω σοι. 30 Ὁ δὲ οὐκ
ἤθελεν, eἀλλὰ ἀπελθὼν ἔβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς φυλακήν, ἕως fοὗ ἀποδῷ
τὸ ὀφειλόμενον. 31 Ἰδόντες gδὲ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτοῦ τὰ γενόμενα
ἐλυπήθησαν σφόδρα∙ καὶ ἐλθόντες διεσάφησαν τῷ κυρίῳ hἑαυτῶν
πάντα τὰ γενόμενα. 32 Τότε προσκαλεσάμενος αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ
λέγει αὐτῷ, Δοῦλε πονηρέ, πᾶσαν τὴν ὀφειλὴν ἐκείνην ἀφῆκά σοι,
ἐπεὶ παρεκάλεσάς με∙ 33 οὐκ ἔδει καὶ σὲ ἐλεῆσαι τὸν σύνδουλόν σου,

ἐπέτρεψεν ὑμῖν ἀπολῦσαι τὰς γυναῖκας ὑμῶν∙ ἀπ ̓ ἀρχῆς δὲ οὐ γέγονεν
οὕτω. 9 Λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν ςὅτι ὃς ἂν ἀπολύσῃ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, dμὴ ἐπὶ
πορνείᾳ, καὶ γαμήσῃ ἄλλην, μοιχᾶται∙ eκαὶ ὁ ἀπολελυμένην γαμήσας
μοιχᾶται.

10 Λέγουσιν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ fαὐτοῦ, Εἰ οὕτως ἐστὶν ἡ αἰτία τοῦ
ἀνθρώπου μετὰ τῆς γυναικός, οὐ συμφέρει γαμῆσαι. 11 Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Οὐ πάντες χωροῦσι τὸν λόγον gτοῦτον, ἀλλ ̓ οἷς δέδοται. 12 Εἰσὶ
γὰρ εὐνοῦχοι, οἵτινες ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς ἐγεννήθησαν οὕτω∙ καί εἰσιν

Ἄφετε τὰ παιδία, καὶ μὴ κωλύετε αὐτὰ ἐλθεῖν πρός με∙ τῶν γὰρ τοιούτων ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν. 15 Καὶ ἐπιθεὶς ϳαὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας,

10 Καὶ εἰσελθόντος αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, ἐσείσθη πᾶσα ἡ πόλις,
λέγουσα, Τίς ἐστιν οὗτος; 11 Οἱ δὲ ὄχλοι ἔλεγον, Οὗτός ἐστιν aἸησοῦς
ὁ προφήτης, ὁ ἀπὸ bΝαζαρὲτ τῆς Γαλιλαίας.

12 Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ςὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν dτοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐξέβαλε
πάντας τοὺς πωλοῦντας καὶ ἀγοράζοντας ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, καὶ τὰς τραπέζας
τῶν κολλυβιστῶν κατέστρεψε, καὶ τὰς καθέδρας τῶν πωλούντων τὰς
περιστεράς. 13 Καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς, Γέγραπται, Ὁ οἶκός μου οἶκος προσευχῆς κληθήσεται∙ ὑμεῖς δὲ αὐτὸν eἐποιήσατε σπήλαιον λῃστῶν.

14 Καὶ προσῆλθον αὐτῷ fχωλοὶ καὶ τυφλοὶ ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ∙ καὶ ἐθεράπευσεν αὐτούς. 15 Ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς τὰ θαυμάσια ἃ ἐποίησε, καὶ τοὺς παῖδας gκράζοντας ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, καὶ λέγοντας,
Ὡσαννὰ τῷ υἱῷ hΔαυίδ, ἠγανάκτησαν, 16 καὶ iεἶπον αὐτῷ, Ἀκούεις τί
οὗτοι λέγουσιν; Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς λέγει αὐτοῖς, Ναί∙ οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε ὅτι

Ἐκ στόματος νηπίων καὶ θηλαζόντων
κατηρτίσω αἶνον;

17 Καὶ καταλιπὼν αὐτοὺς ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως εἰς Βηθανίαν, καὶ
ηὐλίσθη ἐκεῖ.

18 ϳΠρωΐας δὲ kἐπανάγων εἰς τὴν πόλιν, ἐπείνασε. 19 Καὶ ἰδὼν συκῆν
μίαν ἐπὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ, ἦλθεν ἐπ ̓ αὐτήν, καὶ οὐδὲν εὗρεν ἐν αὐτῇ εἰ μὴ φύλλα
μόνον∙ καὶ λέγει αὐτῇ, lΜηκέτι ἐκ σοῦ καρπὸς γένηται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
Καὶ ἐξηράνθη παραχρῆμα ἡ συκῆ. 20 Καὶ ἰδόντες οἱ μαθηταὶ ἐθαύμασαν, λέγοντες, Πῶς παραχρῆμα ἐξηράνθη ἡ συκῆ; 21 Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ
Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, ἐὰν ἔχητε πίστιν, καὶ μὴ διακριθῆτε, οὐ μόνον τὸ τῆς συκῆς ποιήσετε, ἀλλὰ κἂν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ εἴπητε,
Ἄρθητι, καὶ βλήθητι εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, γενήσεται. 22 Καὶ πάντα ὅσα

δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Ἐρωτήσω ὑμᾶς κἀγὼ λόγον ἕνα, ὃν ἐὰν
εἴπητέ μοι, κἀγὼ ὑμῖν ἐρῶ ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιῶ. 25 Τὸ βάπτισμα

οὖν οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ; 26 Ἐὰν δὲ εἴπωμεν, Ἐξ ἀνθρώπων, φοβούμεθα τὸν ὄχλον∙ πάντες γὰρ ςἔχουσι τὸν Ἰωάννην ὡς προφήτην. 27 Καὶ

Οὐδὲ ἐγὼ λέγω ὑμῖν ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιῶ.

28 Τί δὲ ὑμῖν δοκεῖ; eἌνθρωπος εἶχε τέκνα δύο, fκαὶ προσελθὼν τῷ

29 Ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν, hΟὐ θέλω∙ ὕστερον δὲ μεταμεληθείς, ἀπῆλθε.
30 iΚαὶ προσελθὼν τῷ ϳδευτέρῳ εἶπεν ὡσαύτως. Ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν,
kἘγώ, κύριε∙ καὶ οὐκ ἀπῆλθε. 31 Τίς ἐκ τῶν δύο ἐποίησε τὸ θέλημα τοῦ
πατρός; Λέγουσιν lαὐτῷ, Ὁ mπρῶτος. Λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἀμὴν
λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι οἱ τελῶναι καὶ αἱ πόρναι προάγουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ. 32 Ἦλθε γὰρ nπρὸς ὑμᾶς Ἰωάννης ἐν ὁδῷ δικαιοσύνης,

ἐστιν ὁ κληρονόμος∙ δεῦτε, ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν, καὶ aκατάσχωμεν τὴν

τεύματα αὐτοῦ ἀπώλεσε τοὺς φονεῖς ἐκείνους, καὶ τὴν πόλιν αὐτῶν
ἐνέπρησε. 8 Τότε λέγει τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ, Ὁ μὲν γάμος ἕτοιμός ἐστιν,
οἱ δὲ κεκλημένοι οὐκ ἦσαν ἄξιοι. 9 Πορεύεσθε οὖν ἐπὶ τὰς διεξόδους
τῶν ὁδῶν, καὶ ὅσους aἂν εὕρητε, καλέσατε εἰς τοὺς γάμους. 10 Καὶ
ἐξελθόντες οἱ δοῦλοι ἐκεῖνοι εἰς τὰς ὁδοὺς συνήγαγον πάντας bὅσους
εὗρον, πονηρούς τε καὶ ἀγαθούς∙ καὶ ἐπλήσθη ὁ ςγάμος ἀνακειμένων.
11 Εἰσελθὼν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς θεάσασθαι τοὺς ἀνακειμένους εἶδεν ἐκεῖ

τάλαντά μοι παρέδωκας∙ ἴδε, ἄλλα δύο τάλαντα ἐκέρδησα aἐπ ̓ αὐτοῖς.
23 Ἔφη αὐτῷ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ, Εὖ, δοῦλε ἀγαθὲ καὶ πιστέ, ἐπὶ ὀλίγα ἦς
πιστός, ἐπὶ πολλῶν σε καταστήσω∙ εἴσελθε εἰς τὴν χαρὰν τοῦ κυρίου
σου. 24 Προσελθὼν δὲ καὶ ὁ τὸ ἓν τάλαντον εἰληφὼς εἶπε, Κύριε, ἔγνων
σε ὅτι σκληρὸς εἶ ἄνθρωπος, θερίζων ὅπου οὐκ ἔσπειρας, καὶ συνάγων
ὅθεν οὐ διεσκόρπισας∙ 25 καὶ φοβηθείς, ἀπελθὼν ἔκρυψα τὸ τάλαντόν
σου ἐν τῇ γῇ∙ ἴδε, ἔχεις τὸ σόν. 26 Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ εἶπεν
αὐτῷ, Πονηρὲ δοῦλε καὶ ὀκνηρέ, ᾔδεις ὅτι θερίζω ὅπου οὐκ ἔσπειρα,
καὶ συνάγω ὅθεν οὐ διεσκόρπισα∙ 27 ἔδει bοὖν σε βαλεῖν ςτὸ ἀργύριόν
μου τοῖς dτραπεζίταις, καὶ ἐλθὼν ἐγὼ ἐκομισάμην ἂν τὸ ἐμὸν σὺν τόκῳ.
28 Ἄρατε οὖν ἀπ ̓ αὐτοῦ τὸ τάλαντον, καὶ δότε τῷ ἔχοντι τὰ δέκα τάλαντα. 29 Τῷ γὰρ ἔχοντι παντὶ δοθήσεται καὶ περισσευθήσεται∙ eἀπὸ
δὲ τοῦ μὴ ἔχοντος, καὶ ὃ fἔχει ἀρθήσεται ἀπ ̓ αὐτοῦ. 30 Καὶ τὸν ἀχρεῖον
δοῦλον gἐκβάλετε εἰς τὸ σκότος τὸ ἐξώτερον. Ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς
καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων.

31 Ὅταν δὲ ἔλθῃ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες
οἱ hἅγιοι ἄγγελοι μετ ̓ αὐτοῦ, τότε καθίσει ἐπὶ θρόνου δόξης αὐτοῦ,
32 καὶ iσυναχθήσεται ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ϳἀφοριεῖ
αὐτοὺς ἀπ ̓ ἀλλήλων, ὥσπερ ὁ ποιμὴν ἀφορίζει τὰ πρόβατα ἀπὸ τῶν
ἐρίφων∙ 33 καὶ στήσει τὰ μὲν πρόβατα ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ, τὰ δὲ ἐρίφια
ἐξ εὐωνύμων. 34 Τότε ἐρεῖ ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῖς ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ, Δεῦτε,
οἱ εὐλογημένοι τοῦ πατρός μου, κληρονομήσατε τὴν ἡτοιμασμένην
ὑμῖν βασιλείαν ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου. 35 Ἐπείνασα γάρ, καὶ ἐδώκατέ

14 Τότε πορευθεὶς εἷς τῶν δώδεκα, ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰούδας Ἰσκαριώτης, πρὸς τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς, 15 εἶπε, Τί θέλετέ μοι δοῦναι, bκἀγὼ ὑμῖν
παραδώσω αὐτόν; Οἱ δὲ ἔστησαν αὐτῷ τριάκοντα ἀργύρια, 16 καὶ ἀπὸ
τότε ἐζήτει εὐκαιρίαν ἵνα αὐτὸν παραδῷ.

εἶπεν, Ὑπάγετε εἰς τὴν πόλιν πρὸς τὸν δεῖνα, καὶ εἴπατε αὐτῷ, Ὁ διδάσκαλος λέγει, Ὁ καιρός μου ἐγγύς ἐστι∙ πρὸς σε ποιῶ τὸ Πάσχα μετὰ
τῶν μαθητῶν μου. 19 Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ μαθηταὶ ὡς συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς ὁ
Ἰησοῦς, καὶ ἡτοίμασαν τὸ Πάσχα.

20 Ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης ἀνέκειτο μετὰ τῶν eδώδεκα. 21 Καὶ ἐσθιόντων αὐτῶν εἶπεν, Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι εἷς ἐξ ὑμῶν παραδώσει με. 22 Καὶ
λυπούμενοι σφόδρα ἤρξαντο λέγειν αὐτῷ fἕκαστος αὐτῶν, Μήτι ἐγώ

ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ∙ γέγραπται γάρ, Πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα, καὶ
dδιασκορπισθήσεται τὰ πρόβατα τῆς ποίμνης. 32 Μετὰ δὲ τὸ ἐγερθῆναί
με, προάξω ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν. 33 Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Πέτρος εἶπεν
αὐτῷ, Εἰ eπάντες σκανδαλισθήσονται ἐν σοί, ἐγὼ fδὲ οὐδέποτε σκανδαλισθήσομαι. 34 Ἔφη αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἀμὴν λέγω σοι ὅτι ἐν ταύτῃ

75 Καὶ ἐμνήσθη ὁ Πέτρος τοῦ ῥήματος aτοῦ Ἰησοῦ εἰρηκότος bαὐτῷ ὅτι
Πρὶν ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι, τρὶς ἀπαρνήσῃ με. Καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἔξω ἔκλαυσε
πικρῶς.

27 Πρωΐας δὲ γενομένης, συμβούλιον ἔλαβον πάντες οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς

καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ςτοῦ λαοῦ κατὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ, ὥστε θανατῶσαι αὐτόν∙ 2 καὶ δήσαντες αὐτὸν ἀπήγαγον καὶ παρέδωκαν dαὐτὸν
eΠοντίῳ Πιλάτῳ τῷ ἡγεμόνι.

3 Τότε ἰδὼν Ἰούδας ὁ fπαραδιδοὺς αὐτὸν ὅτι κατεκρίθη, μεταμεληθεὶς gἀπέστρεψε τὰ τριάκοντα ἀργύρια τοῖς ἀρχιερεῦσι καὶ hτοῖς
πρεσβυτέροις, 4 λέγων, Ἥμαρτον παραδοὺς αἷμα iἀθῷον. Οἱ δὲ ϳεἶπον,
Τί πρὸς ἡμᾶς; Σὺ kὄψει. 5 Καὶ ῥίψας τὰ ἀργύρια lἐν τῷ ναῷ, ἀνεχώρησε∙ καὶ ἀπελθὼν ἀπήγξατο. 6 Οἱ δὲ ἀρχιερεῖς λαβόντες τὰ ἀργύρια
mεἶπον, Οὐκ ἔξεστι βαλεῖν αὐτὰ εἰς τὸν κορβανᾶν, ἐπεὶ τιμὴ αἵματός
ἐστι. 7 Συμβούλιον δὲ λαβόντες ἠγόρασαν ἐξ αὐτῶν τὸν ἀγρὸν τοῦ κεραμέως, εἰς ταφὴν τοῖς ξένοις. 8 Διὸ ἐκλήθη ὁ ἀγρὸς ἐκεῖνος Ἀγρὸς
Αἵματος, ἕως τῆς σήμερον. 9 Τότε ἐπληρώθη τὸ ῥηθὲν διὰ Ἰερεμίου
τοῦ προφήτου, λέγοντος, Καὶ ἔλαβον τὰ τριάκοντα ἀργύρια, τὴν τιμὴν
τοῦ τετιμημένου, ὃν ἐτιμήσαντο ἀπὸ υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ∙ 10 καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὰ
εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν τοῦ κεραμέως, καθὰ συνέταξέ μοι Κύριος.

11 Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς nἔστη ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ ἡγεμόνος∙ καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν
αὐτὸν ὁ ἡγεμών, λέγων, Σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων; Ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς
ἔφη oαὐτῷ, Σὺ λέγεις. 12 Καὶ ἐν τῷ κατηγορεῖσθαι αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχιερέων καὶ pτῶν πρεσβυτέρων, οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίνατο. 13 Τότε λέγει αὐτῷ
ὁ qΠιλάτος, Οὐκ ἀκούεις πόσα σου καταμαρτυροῦσι; 14 Καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ πρὸς οὐδὲ ἓν ῥῆμα, ὥστε θαυμάζειν τὸν ἡγεμόνα λίαν.

15 Κατὰ δὲ ἑορτὴν εἰώθει ὁ ἡγεμὼν ἀπολύειν ἕνα τῷ ὄχλῳ δέσμιον,

20 Οἱ δὲ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἔπεισαν τοὺς ὄχλους ἵνα αἰτήσωνται τὸν Βαραββᾶν, τὸν δὲ Ἰησοῦν ἀπολέσωσιν. 21 Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ

25 Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς πᾶς ὁ λαὸς εἶπε, Τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐφ ̓ ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ

aἡ φυγὴ ὑμῶν χειμῶνος. 19 Ἔσονται γὰρ αἱ ἡμέραι ἐκεῖναι θλίψις, οἵα
οὐ γέγονε τοιαύτη ἀπ ̓ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως bἧς ἔκτισεν ὁ Θεὸς ἕως τοῦ νῦν,
καὶ οὐ μὴ γένηται. 20 Καὶ εἰ μὴ ςΚύριος ἐκολόβωσε τὰς ἡμέρας, οὐκ
ἂν ἐσώθη πᾶσα σάρξ∙ ἀλλὰ διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς, οὓς ἐξελέξατο, ἐκολόβωσε τὰς ἡμέρας. 21 dΤότε ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ, eἸδού, ὧδε ὁ Χριστός,
fἢ gἸδού, ἐκεῖ, μὴ hπιστεύετε. 22 Ἐγερθήσονται γὰρ ψευδόχριστοι καὶ
ψευδοπροφῆται, καὶ δώσουσι σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα, πρὸς τὸ ἀποπλανᾷν,
εἰ δυνατόν, iκαὶ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς. 23 Ὑμεῖς δὲ βλέπετε∙ ϳἰδού, προείρηκα
ὑμῖν kπάντα.

24 lἈλλ ̓ ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις, μετὰ τὴν θλίψιν ἐκείνην, ὁ ἥλιος
σκοτισθήσεται, καὶ ἡ σελήνη οὐ δώσει τὸ φέγγος αὐτῆς, 25 καὶ οἱ ἀστέρες mτοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἔσονται ἐκπίπτοντες, καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς σαλευθήσονται. 26 Καὶ τότε ὄψονται τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐρχόμενον ἐν νεφέλαις μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς καὶ δόξης. 27 Καὶ τότε ἀποστελεῖ τοὺς ἀγγέλους nαὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπισυνάξει τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς oαὐτοῦ
ἐκ τῶν τεσσάρων ἀνέμων, ἀπ ̓ ἄκρου pγῆς ἕως ἄκρου qοὐρανοῦ.

28 Ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς συκῆς μάθετε τὴν παραβολήν∙ ὅταν rαὐτῆς ἤδη ὁ κλάδος sἁπαλὸς γένηται, καὶ ἐκφύῃ τὰ φύλλα, tγινώσκετε ὅτι ἐγγὺς τὸ θέρος ἐστίν∙ 29 οὕτω καὶ ὑμεῖς, ὅταν uταῦτα ἴδητε vγινόμενα, wγινώσκετε
ὅτι ἐγγύς ἐστιν ἐπὶ θύραις. 30 Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ ἡ

5 Ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἡρῴδου aτοῦ βασιλέως τῆς Ἰουδαίας
ἱερεύς τις ὀνόματι Ζαχαρίας, ἐξ ἐφημερίας Ἀβιά∙ καὶ bἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ
ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Ἀαρών, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς ςἘλισάβετ. 6 Ἦσαν
δὲ δίκαιοι ἀμφότεροι dἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ, πορευόμενοι ἐν πάσαις ταῖς
ἐντολαῖς καὶ δικαιώμασι τοῦ Κυρίου ἄμεμπτοι. 7 Καὶ οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς
τέκνον, καθότι eἡ Ἐλισάβετ ἦν στεῖρα, καὶ ἀμφότεροι προβεβηκότες
ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν ἦσαν.

8 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ τάξει τῆς ἐφημερίας
αὐτοῦ ἔναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ, 9 κατὰ τὸ ἔθος τῆς fἱερατείας, ἔλαχε τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸν ναὸν τοῦ Κυρίου. 10 Καὶ πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος gἦν τοῦ
λαοῦ προσευχόμενον ἔξω τῇ ὥρᾳ τοῦ θυμιάματος. 11 Ὤφθη δὲ αὐτῷ
ἄγγελος Κυρίου, ἑστὼς ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τοῦ θυμιάματος.
12 Καὶ ἐταράχθη Ζαχαρίας ἰδών, καὶ φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ ̓ αὐτόν. 13 Εἶπε
δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἄγγελος, Μὴ φοβοῦ, Ζαχαρία∙ διότι εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς σου, καὶ ἡ γυνή σου hἘλισάβετ γεννήσει υἱόν σοι, καὶ καλέσεις τὸ
ὄνομα αὐτοῦ iἸωάννην. 14 Καὶ ἔσται χαρά σοι καὶ ἀγαλλίασις, καὶ πολλοὶ ἐπὶ τῇ ϳγεννήσει αὐτοῦ χαρήσονται. 15 Ἔσται γὰρ μέγας ἐνώπιον

πλησθήσεται ἔτι ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ. 16 Καὶ πολλοὺς τῶν υἱῶν
Ἰσραὴλ ἐπιστρέψει ἐπὶ Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῶν∙ 17 καὶ αὐτὸς προελεύσεται ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει bἨλίου, ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα, καὶ ἀπειθεῖς ἐν φρονήσει δικαίων, ἑτοιμάσαι
Κυρίῳ λαὸν κατεσκευασμένον. 18 Καὶ εἶπε Ζαχαρίας πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον,
Κατὰ τί γνώσομαι τοῦτο; Ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι πρεσβύτης, καὶ ἡ γυνή μου
προβεβηκυῖα ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῆς. 19 Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἄγγελος εἶπεν
αὐτῷ, Ἐγώ εἰμι Γαβριὴλ ὁ παρεστηκὼς ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ∙ καὶ ἀπεστάλην λαλῆσαι πρός σε, καὶ εὐαγγελίσασθαί σοι ταῦτα. 20 Καὶ ἰδού,

21 Καὶ ἦν ὁ λαὸς προσδοκῶν τὸν Ζαχαρίαν∙ καὶ ἐθαύμαζον ἐν τῷ
χρονίζειν ςαὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ναῷ. 22 Ἐξελθὼν δὲ οὐκ dἠδύνατο λαλῆσαι
αὐτοῖς∙ καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι ὀπτασίαν ἑώρακεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ∙ καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν
διανεύων αὐτοῖς, καὶ διέμενε κωφός. 23 Καὶ ἐγένετο, ὡς ἐπλήσθησαν αἱ
ἡμέραι τῆς λειτουργίας αὐτοῦ, ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ.

24 Μετὰ δὲ ταύτας τὰς ἡμέρας συνέλαβεν eἘλισάβετ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ περιέκρυβεν ἑαυτὴν μῆνας πέντε, λέγουσα 25 ὅτι Οὕτω μοι

καὶ κατεπατήθη, καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατέφαγεν αὐτό. 6 Καὶ

καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν πάντες∙ καὶ ἤρθη τὸ περισσεῦσαν αὐτοῖς κλασμάτων, κόφινοι δώδεκα.

18 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτὸν προσευχόμενον καταμόνας,
συνῆσαν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταί∙ καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτούς, λέγων, Τίνα με
dλέγουσιν οἱ ὄχλοι εἶναι; 19 Οἱ δὲ ἀποκριθέντες eεἶπον, fἸωάννην τὸν
βαπτιστήν∙ ἄλλοι δὲ gἨλίαν∙ ἄλλοι δὲ ὅτι Προφήτης τις τῶν ἀρχαίων
ἀνέστη. 20 Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς, Ὑμεῖς δὲ τίνα με λέγετε εἶναι; hἈποκριθεὶς
δὲ ὁ Πέτρος εἶπε, Τὸν Χριστὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ.

21 Ὁ δὲ ἐπιτιμήσας αὐτοῖς παρήγγειλε μηδενὶ iεἰπεῖν τοῦτο, 22 εἰπὼν
ὅτι Δεῖ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου πολλὰ παθεῖν, καὶ ἀποδοκιμασθῆναι
ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων καὶ ἀρχιερέων καὶ γραμματέων, καὶ ἀποκτανθῆναι, καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ϳἀναστῆναι.

23 Ἔλεγε δὲ πρὸς πάντας, Εἴ τις θέλει ὀπίσω μου kἐλθεῖν,
lἀπαρνησάσθω ἑαυτόν, καὶ ἀράτω τὸν σταυρὸν mαὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἀκολουθείτω μοι. 24 Ὃς γὰρ nἐὰν θέλῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ σῶσαι,
ἀπολέσει αὐτήν∙ ὃς δ ̓ ἂν ἀπολέσῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ,
οὗτος σώσει αὐτήν. 25 Τί γὰρ ὠφελεῖται ἄνθρωπος, κερδήσας τὸν
κόσμον ὅλον, ἑαυτὸν δὲ ἀπολέσας ἢ ζημιωθείς; 26 Ὃς γὰρ oἂν
ἐπαισχυνθῇ με καὶ τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους, τοῦτον ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου
ἐπαισχυνθήσεται, ὅταν ἔλθῃ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ

30 Καὶ ἰδού, ἄνδρες δύο συνελάλουν αὐτῷ, οἵτινες ἦσαν dΜωσῆς καὶ

ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς πανδοχεῖον, καὶ ἐπεμελήθη αὐτοῦ. 35 Καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν

ὀνόματι Λάζαρος, ὃς ἐβέβλητο πρὸς τὸν πυλῶνα αὐτοῦ ςἡλκωμένος
21 καὶ ἐπιθυμῶν χορτασθῆναι ἀπὸ dτῶν ψιχίων τῶν πιπτόντων ἀπὸ τῆς
τραπέζης τοῦ πλουσίου∙ ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ κύνες ἐρχόμενοι eἀπέλειχον τὰ
ἕλκη αὐτοῦ. 22 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἀποθανεῖν τὸν πτωχόν, καὶ ἀπενεχθῆναι
αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγγέλων εἰς τὸν κόλπον fἈβραάμ∙ ἀπέθανε δὲ καὶ ὁ
πλούσιος, καὶ ἐτάφη. 23 Καὶ ἐν τῷ ᾍδῃ ἐπάρας τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ,
ὑπάρχων ἐν βασάνοις, ὁρᾷ gτὸν Ἀβραὰμ ἀπὸ μακρόθεν, καὶ Λάζαρον
ἐν τοῖς κόλποις αὐτοῦ. 24 Καὶ αὐτὸς φωνήσας εἶπε, Πάτερ Ἀβραάμ,
ἐλέησόν με, καὶ πέμψον Λάζαρον, ἵνα βάψῃ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ δακτύλου
αὐτοῦ ὕδατος, καὶ καταψύξῃ τὴν γλῶσσάν μου∙ ὅτι ὀδυνῶμαι ἐν τῇ
φλογὶ ταύτῃ. 25 Εἶπε δὲ Ἀβραάμ, Τέκνον, μνήσθητι ὅτι ἀπέλαβες hσὺ
τὰ ἀγαθά σου ἐν τῇ ζωῇ σου, καὶ Λάζαρος ὁμοίως τὰ κακά∙ νῦν δὲ
iὧδε παρακαλεῖται, σὺ δὲ ὀδυνᾶσαι. 26 Καὶ ϳἐπὶ πᾶσι τούτοις, μεταξὺ
ἡμῶν καὶ ὑμῶν χάσμα μέγα ἐστήρικται, ὅπως οἱ θέλοντες διαβῆναι
kἔνθεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς μὴ δύνωνται, μηδὲ lοἱ ἐκεῖθεν πρὸς ἡμᾶς διαπερῶσιν.
27 Εἶπε δέ, Ἐρωτῶ mοὖν σε, πάτερ, ἵνα πέμψῃς αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ
πατρός μου, 28 ἔχω γὰρ πέντε ἀδελφούς, ὅπως διαμαρτύρηται αὐτοῖς,
ἵνα μὴ καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔλθωσιν εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον τῆς βασάνου. 29 Λέγει
nαὐτῷ Ἀβραάμ, Ἔχουσι oΜωσέα καὶ τοὺς προφήτας∙ ἀκουσάτωσαν
αὐτῶν. 30 Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, Οὐχί, πάτερ Ἀβραάμ∙ ἀλλ ̓ ἐάν τις ἀπὸ νεκρῶν
πορευθῇ πρὸς αὐτούς, μετανοήσουσιν. 31 Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ, Εἰ pΜωσέως
καὶ τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἀκούουσιν, qοὐδέ, ἐάν τις ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ,
πεισθήσονται.

20 Ἐπερωτηθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν Φαρισαίων, πότε ἔρχεται ἡ βασιλεία

ἀνέβη ἐπὶ bσυκομωραίαν ἵνα ἴδῃ αὐτόν∙ ὅτι ςἐκείνης dἔμελλε διέρχεσθαι. 5 Καὶ ὡς ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον, ἀναβλέψας ὁ Ἰησοῦς eεἶδεν αὐτόν,
καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν, Ζακχαῖε, σπεύσας κατάβηθι∙ σήμερον γὰρ ἐν τῷ
οἴκῳ σου δεῖ με μεῖναι. 6 Καὶ σπεύσας κατέβη, καὶ ὑπεδέξατο αὐτὸν

Κύριον, Ἰδού, τὰ gἡμίση τῶν ὑπαρχόντων μου, Κύριε, hδίδωμι τοῖς
πτωχοῖς∙ καὶ εἴ τινός τι ἐσυκοφάντησα, ἀποδίδωμι τετραπλοῦν. 9 Εἶπε

καθότι καὶ αὐτὸς υἱὸς Ἀβραάμ ἐστιν. 10 Ἦλθε γὰρ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου
ζητῆσαι καὶ σῶσαι τὸ ἀπολωλός.

45 Ἀκούοντος δὲ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ, εἶπε τοῖς μαθηταῖς aαὐτοῦ,
46 Προσέχετε ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων τῶν θελόντων περιπατεῖν
ἐν στολαῖς, καὶ φιλούντων ἀσπασμοὺς ἐν ταῖς ἀγοραῖς, καὶ
πρωτοκαθεδρίας ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς, καὶ πρωτοκλισίας ἐν τοῖς
δείπνοις∙ 47 οἳ κατεσθίουσι τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν, καὶ προφάσει μακρὰ
προσεύχονται. Οὗτοι bλήψονται περισσότερον κρίμα.

21 Ἀναβλέψας δὲ εἶδε τοὺς βάλλοντας ςτὰ δῶρα αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ

γαζοφυλάκιον πλουσίους∙ 2 εἶδε δέ dτινα καὶ χήραν πενιχρὰν
βάλλουσαν ἐκεῖ eδύο λεπτά, 3 καὶ εἶπεν, Ἀληθῶς λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ἡ χήρα
fἡ πτωχὴ αὕτη πλεῖον πάντων ἔβαλεν∙ 4 gἅπαντες γὰρ οὗτοι ἐκ τοῦ
περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς ἔβαλον εἰς τὰ δῶρα hτοῦ Θεοῦ∙ αὕτη δὲ ἐκ τοῦ
ὑστερήματος αὐτῆς iἅπαντα τὸν βίον ὃν εἶχεν ἔβαλε.

5 Καί τινων λεγόντων περὶ τοῦ ἱεροῦ, ὅτι λίθοις καλοῖς καὶ ἀναθήμασι κεκόσμηται, εἶπε, 6 Ταῦτα ἃ θεωρεῖτε, ἐλεύσονται ἡμέραι ἐν αἷς
οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται λίθος ἐπὶ ϳλίθῳ, ὃς οὐ καταλυθήσεται.

7 Ἐπηρώτησαν δὲ αὐτόν, λέγοντες, Διδάσκαλε, πότε οὖν ταῦτα
ἔσται; Καὶ τί τὸ σημεῖον ὅταν μέλλῃ ταῦτα kγίνεσθαι; 8 Ὁ δὲ εἶπε,
Βλέπετε μὴ πλανηθῆτε∙ πολλοὶ γὰρ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου,
λέγοντες lὅτι Ἐγώ εἰμι∙ καί, Ὁ καιρὸς ἤγγικε, μὴ mοὖν πορευθῆτε
ὀπίσω αὐτῶν. 9 Ὅταν δὲ ἀκούσητε πολέμους καὶ ἀκαταστασίας, μὴ
πτοηθῆτε∙ δεῖ γὰρ ταῦτα γενέσθαι πρῶτον, ἀλλ ̓ οὐκ εὐθέως τὸ τέλος.
10 Τότε ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς, Ἐγερθήσεται ἔθνος nἐπὶ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν∙ 11 σεισμοί τε μεγάλοι oκατὰ τόπους καὶ λιμοὶ καὶ

ὡς ἐλάλησεν ὑμῖν, ἔτι ὢν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ, 7 λέγων lὅτι δεῖ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ
ἀνθρώπου παραδοθῆναι εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων ἁμαρτωλῶν, καὶ σταυρωθῆναι, καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἀναστῆναι. 8 Καὶ ἐμνήσθησαν τῶν ῥημάτων αὐτοῦ, 9 καὶ ὑποστρέψασαι ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου, ἀπήγγειλαν ταῦτα
πάντα τοῖς ἕνδεκα καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς λοιποῖς. 10 Ἦσαν δὲ ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ Μαρία καὶ mἸωάννα καὶ Μαρία nἸακώβου, καὶ αἱ λοιπαὶ σὺν αὐταῖς, oαἳ
ἔλεγον πρὸς τοὺς ἀποστόλους ταῦτα. 11 Καὶ ἐφάνησαν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν
ὡσεὶ λῆρος τὰ ῥήματα pαὐτῶν, καὶ ἠπίστουν αὐταῖς. 12 Ὁ δὲ Πέτρος
ἀναστὰς ἔδραμεν ἐπὶ τὸ μνημεῖον, καὶ παρακύψας βλέπει τὰ ὀθόνια
qκείμενα μόνα∙ καὶ ἀπῆλθε πρὸς rἑαυτὸν θαυμάζων τὸ γεγονός.

εἰς κώμην ἀπέχουσαν σταδίους ἑξήκοντα ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ, ᾗ ὄνομα

ἐγένετο, καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἓν ὃ γέγονεν. 4 Ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἦν,

καὶ ἡ σκοτία αὐτὸ οὐ κατέλαβεν.

6 Ἐγένετο ἄνθρωπος ἀπεσταλμένος παρὰ Θεοῦ, ὄνομα αὐτῷ

ἀλλ ̓ ἵνα μαρτυρήσῃ περὶ τοῦ φωτός.

9 Ἦν τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινόν, ὃ φωτίζει πάντα ἄνθρωπον ἐρχόμενον

καὶ ὁ κόσμος αὐτὸν οὐκ ἔγνω. 11 Εἰς τὰ ἴδια ἦλθε, καὶ οἱ ἴδιοι αὐτὸν οὐ
παρέλαβον. 12 Ὅσοι δὲ ἔλαβον αὐτόν, ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν τέκνα
Θεοῦ γενέσθαι, τοῖς πιστεύουσιν εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ∙ 13 οἳ οὐκ ἐξ αἱμάτων, οὐδὲ ἐκ θελήματος σαρκός, οὐδὲ ἐκ θελήματος ἀνδρός, ἀλλ ̓ ἐκ

Ἴδε ἀληθῶς aἸσραηλίτης, ἐν ᾧ δόλος οὐκ ἔστι. 48 Λέγει αὐτῷ Ναθαναήλ, Πόθεν με γινώσκεις; Ἀπεκρίθη bἸησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Πρὸ
τοῦ σε Φίλιππον φωνῆσαι, ὄντα ὑπὸ τὴν συκῆν, εἶδόν σε. 49 Ἀπεκρίθη
ςΝαθαναὴλ καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, dῬαββί, σὺ εἶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ, σὺ eεἶ ὁ
βασιλεὺς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. 50 Ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Ὅτι εἶπόν
fσοι, Εἶδόν σε ὑποκάτω τῆς συκῆς, πιστεύεις; Μείζω τούτων gὄψει.
51 Καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, hἀπ ̓ ἄρτι ὄψεσθε τὸν οὐρανὸν
ἀνεῳγότα, καὶ τοὺς ἀγγέλους τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀναβαίνοντας καὶ καταβαίνοντας ἐπὶ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου.

2 Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ γάμος ἐγένετο ἐν Κανᾷ τῆς Γαλιλαίας, καὶ

ἦν ἡ μήτηρ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἐκεῖ∙ 2 ἐκλήθη δὲ καὶ ὁ Ἰησοῦς καὶ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν γάμον. 3 Καὶ ὑστερήσαντος οἴνου, λέγει ἡ μήτηρ
τοῦ Ἰησοῦ πρὸς αὐτόν, Οἶνον οὐκ ἔχουσι. 4 iΛέγει αὐτῇ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Τί
ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί, γύναι; Οὔπω ἥκει ἡ ὥρα μου. 5 Λέγει ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ τοῖς
διακόνοις, Ὅ τι ἂν λέγῃ ὑμῖν, ποιήσατε.

τῶν Ἰουδαίων, χωροῦσαι ἀνὰ μετρητὰς δύο ἢ τρεῖς. 7 Λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ
Ἰησοῦς, Γεμίσατε τὰς ὑδρίας ὕδατος. Καὶ ἐγέμισαν αὐτὰς ἕως ἄνω.
8 Καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς, Ἀντλήσατε νῦν, καὶ φέρετε τῷ kἀρχιτρικλίνῳ. lΚαὶ
ἤνεγκαν. 9 Ὡς δὲ ἐγεύσατο ὁ mἀρχιτρίκλινος τὸ ὕδωρ οἶνον γεγενημένον, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει πόθεν ἐστίν-οἱ δὲ διάκονοι ᾔδεισαν οἱ ἠντληκότες
τὸ ὕδωρ-φωνεῖ τὸν νυμφίον ὁ nἀρχιτρίκλινος, 10 καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, Πᾶς
ἄνθρωπος πρῶτον τὸν καλὸν οἶνον τίθησι, καὶ ὅταν μεθυσθῶσι, oτότε
τὸν ἐλάσσω∙ σὺ τετήρηκας τὸν καλὸν οἶνον ἕως ἄρτι. 11 Ταύτην ἐποίησε

13 Καὶ ἐγγὺς ἦν τὸ Πάσχα τῶν Ἰουδαίων, καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα ὁ Ἰησοῦς. 14 Καὶ εὗρεν ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ τοὺς πωλοῦντας βόας καὶ
πρόβατα καὶ περιστεράς, καὶ τοὺς κερματιστὰς καθημένους. 15 Καὶ ποιήσας φραγέλλιον ἐκ σχοινίων πάντας ἐξέβαλεν ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ, τά τε
πρόβατα καὶ τοὺς βόας∙ καὶ τῶν κολλυβιστῶν ἐξέχεε ςτὸ κέρμα, καὶ

Λύσατε τὸν ναὸν τοῦτον, καὶ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερῶ αὐτόν. 20 iΕἶπον
οὖν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, ϳΤεσσαράκοντα καὶ ἓξ ἔτεσιν kᾠκοδομήθη ὁ ναὸς οὗτος, καὶ σὺ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερεῖς αὐτόν; 21 Ἐκεῖνος δὲ ἔλεγε περὶ

ἐὰν μή τις γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν, οὐ δύναται ἰδεῖν τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ.
4 Λέγει πρὸς αὐτὸν ςὁ Νικόδημος, Πῶς δύναται ἄνθρωπος γεννηθῆναι γέρων ὤν; Μὴ δύναται εἰς τὴν κοιλίαν τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ δεύτερον
εἰσελθεῖν καὶ γεννηθῆναι; 5 Ἀπεκρίθη dἸησοῦς, Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω σοι,
ἐὰν μή τις γεννηθῇ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ πνεύματος, οὐ δύναται εἰσελθεῖν εἰς
τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ. 6 Τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς σάρξ ἐστι∙
καὶ τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος πνεῦμά ἐστι. 7 Μὴ θαυμάσῃς ὅτι

Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ταῦτα οὐ γινώσκεις; 11 Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω σοι ὅτι ὃ οἴδαμεν

οὐ λαμβάνετε. 12 Εἰ τὰ ἐπίγεια εἶπον ὑμῖν καὶ οὐ πιστεύετε, πῶς, ἐὰν
εἴπω ὑμῖν τὰ ἐπουράνια, πιστεύσετε; 13 Καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀναβέβηκεν εἰς τὸν

12 Πάλιν οὖν aαὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐλάλησε λέγων, Ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ φῶς
τοῦ κόσμου∙ ὁ ἀκολουθῶν bἐμοὶ οὐ μὴ ςπεριπατήσῃ ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ, ἀλλ ̓
ἕξει τὸ φῶς τῆς ζωῆς. 13 Εἶπον οὖν αὐτῷ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι, Σὺ περὶ σεαυτοῦ
μαρτυρεῖς∙ ἡ μαρτυρία σου οὐκ ἔστιν ἀληθής. 14 Ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς καὶ
εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Κἂν ἐγὼ μαρτυρῶ περὶ ἐμαυτοῦ, ἀληθής ἐστιν ἡ μαρτυρία
μου∙ ὅτι οἶδα πόθεν ἦλθον, καὶ ποῦ ὑπάγω∙ ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐκ οἴδατε πόθεν
ἔρχομαι, dκαὶ ποῦ ὑπάγω. 15 Ὑμεῖς κατὰ τὴν σάρκα κρίνετε∙ ἐγὼ οὐ
κρίνω οὐδένα. 16 Καὶ ἐὰν κρίνω δὲ ἐγώ, ἡ κρίσις ἡ ἐμὴ eἀληθής ἐστιν∙
ὅτι μόνος οὐκ εἰμί, ἀλλ ̓ ἐγὼ καὶ ὁ πέμψας με πατήρ. 17 Καὶ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ
δὲ τῷ ὑμετέρῳ γέγραπται ὅτι δύο ἀνθρώπων ἡ μαρτυρία ἀληθής ἐστιν.
18 Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ μαρτυρῶν περὶ ἐμαυτοῦ, καὶ μαρτυρεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ ὁ πέμψας με πατήρ. 19 Ἔλεγον οὖν αὐτῷ, Ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ πατήρ σου; Ἀπεκρίθη
fἸησοῦς, Οὔτε ἐμὲ οἴδατε, οὔτε τὸν πατέρα μου∙ εἰ ἐμὲ ᾔδειτε, καὶ τὸν
πατέρα μου gᾔδειτε ἄν. 20 Ταῦτα τὰ ῥήματα ἐλάλησεν hὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐν
τῷ γαζοφυλακίῳ, διδάσκων ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ∙ καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐπίασεν αὐτόν, ὅτι
οὔπω ἐληλύθει ἡ ὥρα αὐτοῦ.

21 Εἶπεν οὖν πάλιν αὐτοῖς iὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἐγὼ ὑπάγω, καὶ ζητήσετέ
με, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ ὑμῶν ἀποθανεῖσθε∙ ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω, ὑμεῖς οὐ
δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν. 22 Ἔλεγον οὖν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, Μήτι ἀποκτενεῖ ἑαυτόν,
ὅτι λέγει, Ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω, ὑμεῖς οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν; 23 Καὶ ϳεἶπεν
αὐτοῖς, Ὑμεῖς ἐκ τῶν κάτω ἐστέ, ἐγὼ ἐκ τῶν ἄνω εἰμί∙ ὑμεῖς ἐκ kτοῦ

ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι, ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν. 25 Ἔλεγον οὖν αὐτῷ,

34 Ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι πᾶς ὁ

καὶ ἦλθε βλέπων. 8 Οἱ οὖν γείτονες καὶ οἱ θεωροῦντες αὐτὸν τὸ πρότερον ὅτι ςτυφλὸς ἦν, ἔλεγον, Οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ καθήμενος καὶ προσαιτῶν; 9 Ἄλλοι ἔλεγον ὅτι Οὗτός ἐστιν∙ ἄλλοι dδὲ ὅτι Ὅμοιος αὐτῷ ἐστιν.
Ἐκεῖνος ἔλεγεν ὅτι Ἐγώ εἰμι. 10 Ἔλεγον οὖν αὐτῷ, eΠῶς fἀνεῴχθησάν
σου οἱ ὀφθαλμοί; 11 Ἀπεκρίθη ἐκεῖνος gκαὶ εἶπεν, Ἄνθρωπος λεγόμενος
Ἰησοῦς πηλὸν ἐποίησε, καὶ ἐπέχρισέ μου τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς, καὶ εἶπέ
hμοι, Ὕπαγε εἰς iτὴν κολυμβήθραν τοῦ Σιλωάμ, καὶ νίψαι. Ἀπελθὼν

ἀνέβλεψεν. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Πηλὸν ἐπέθηκέ mμου ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς, καὶ ἐνιψάμην, καὶ βλέπω. 16 Ἔλεγον οὖν ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων τινές,
nΟὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἔστι παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὅτι τὸ σάββατον οὐ τηρεῖ.

πρὸς αὐτὸν λέγουσαι, Κύριε, ἴδε ὃν φιλεῖς ἀσθενεῖ. 4 Ἀκούσας δὲ ὁ

dΜάρθα πρὸς eτὸν Ἰησοῦν, Κύριε, εἰ ἦς ὧδε, fὁ ἀδελφός μου οὐκ ἂν
ἐτεθνήκει. 22 gἈλλὰ καὶ νῦν οἶδα ὅτι ὅσα ἂν αἰτήσῃ τὸν Θεόν, δώσει σοι
ὁ Θεός. 23 Λέγει αὐτῇ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἀναστήσεται ὁ ἀδελφός σου. 24 Λέγει
αὐτῷ hΜάρθα, Οἶδα ὅτι ἀναστήσεται ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει ἐν τῇ ἐσχάτῃ
ἡμέρᾳ. 25 Εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ἀνάστασις καὶ ἡ ζωή∙ ὁ
πιστεύων εἰς ἐμέ, κἂν ἀποθάνῃ, ζήσεται∙ 26 καὶ πᾶς ὁ ζῶν καὶ πιστεύων
εἰς ἐμέ, οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Πιστεύεις τοῦτο; 27 Λέγει αὐτῷ,
Ναί, Κύριε∙ ἐγὼ πεπίστευκα, ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστός, ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὁ
εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἐρχόμενος.

28 Καὶ iταῦτα εἰποῦσα ἀπῆλθε, καὶ ἐφώνησε ϳΜαρίαν τὴν ἀδελφὴν
αὐτῆς λάθρᾳ, kεἰποῦσα, Ὁ διδάσκαλος πάρεστι καὶ φωνεῖ σε.
29 lἘκείνη ὡς ἤκουσεν, mἐγείρεται ταχὺ καὶ nἔρχεται πρὸς αὐτόν.
30 Οὔπω δὲ ἐληλύθει ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὴν κώμην, ἀλλ ̓ oἦν ἐν τῷ τόπῳ

αὐτῆς ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ καὶ παραμυθούμενοι αὐτήν, ἰδόντες τὴν pΜαρίαν
ὅτι ταχέως ἀνέστη καὶ ἐξῆλθεν, ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῇ, qλέγοντες ὅτι
Ὑπάγει εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον, ἵνα κλαύσῃ ἐκεῖ. 32 Ἡ οὖν rΜαρία, ὡς ἦλθεν

bὁ Ἰησοῦς ὅτι πάντα ςδέδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ πατὴρ εἰς τὰς χεῖρας, καὶ ὅτι ἀπὸ
Θεοῦ ἐξῆλθε καὶ πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ὑπάγει, 4 ἐγείρεται ἐκ τοῦ δείπνου, καὶ
τίθησι τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ λαβὼν λέντιον διέζωσεν ἑαυτόν. 5 Εἶτα βάλλει
ὕδωρ εἰς τὸν νιπτῆρα, καὶ ἤρξατο νίπτειν τοὺς πόδας τῶν μαθητῶν, καὶ
ἐκμάσσειν τῷ λεντίῳ ᾧ ἦν διεζωσμένος. 6 Ἔρχεται οὖν πρὸς Σίμωνα
Πέτρον∙ dκαὶ λέγει αὐτῷ eἐκεῖνος, Κύριε, σύ μου νίπτεις τοὺς πόδας;
7 Ἀπεκρίθη Ἰησοῦς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Ὃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ, σὺ οὐκ οἶδας ἄρτι,
γνώσῃ δὲ μετὰ ταῦτα. 8 Λέγει αὐτῷ Πέτρος, Οὐ μὴ νίψῃς fτοὺς πόδας
μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Ἀπεκρίθη gαὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἐὰν μὴ νίψω σε, οὐκ
ἔχεις μέρος μετ ̓ ἐμοῦ. 9 Λέγει αὐτῷ Σίμων Πέτρος, Κύριε, μὴ τοὺς πόδας μου μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς χεῖρας καὶ τὴν κεφαλήν. 10 Λέγει αὐτῷ hὁ
Ἰησοῦς, Ὁ λελουμένος iοὐ χρείαν ἔχει ϳἢ τοὺς πόδας νίψασθαι, ἀλλ ̓
ἔστι καθαρὸς ὅλος∙ καὶ ὑμεῖς καθαροί ἐστε, ἀλλ ̓ οὐχὶ πάντες. 11 ᾜδει

δὲ bπρωΐ, καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸ πραιτώριον, ἵνα μὴ μιανθῶσιν, ςἀλλ ̓ ἵνα φάγωσι τὸ Πάσχα. 29 Ἐξῆλθεν οὖν ὁ dΠιλάτος eπρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ fεἶπε, Τίνα κατηγορίαν φέρετε gκατὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τούτου;
30 Ἀπεκρίθησαν καὶ hεἶπον αὐτῷ, Εἰ μὴ ἦν οὗτος iκακοποιός, οὐκ ἄν
σοι παρεδώκαμεν αὐτόν. 31 Εἶπεν οὖν αὐτοῖς ϳὁ Πιλάτος, Λάβετε αὐτὸν
ὑμεῖς, καὶ κατὰ τὸν νόμον ὑμῶν κρίνατε αὐτόν. Εἶπον kοὖν αὐτῷ οἱ
Ἰουδαῖοι, Ἡμῖν οὐκ ἔξεστιν ἀποκτεῖναι οὐδένα∙ 32 ἵνα ὁ λόγος τοῦ Ἰησοῦ πληρωθῇ, ὃν εἶπε, σημαίνων ποίῳ θανάτῳ lἔμελλεν ἀποθνῄσκειν.
33 Εἰσῆλθεν οὖν mεἰς τὸ πραιτώριον πάλιν ὁ nΠιλάτος, καὶ ἐφώνησε τὸν Ἰησοῦν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων;
34 Ἀπεκρίθη oαὐτῷ pὁ Ἰησοῦς, qἈφ ̓ ἑαυτοῦ σὺ τοῦτο λέγεις, ἢ ἄλλοι rσοι εἶπον περὶ ἐμοῦ; 35 Ἀπεκρίθη ὁ sΠιλάτος, Μήτι ἐγὼ Ἰουδαῖός
εἰμι; Τὸ ἔθνος τὸ σὸν καὶ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς παρέδωκάν σε ἐμοί∙ τί ἐποίησας; 36 Ἀπεκρίθη tἸησοῦς, Ἡ βασιλεία ἡ ἐμὴ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου
τούτου∙ εἰ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου ἦν ἡ βασιλεία ἡ ἐμή, οἱ ὑπηρέται
uἂν οἱ ἐμοὶ ἠγωνίζοντο, ἵνα μὴ παραδοθῶ τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις∙ νῦν δὲ ἡ
βασιλεία ἡ ἐμὴ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐντεῦθεν. 37 Εἶπεν οὖν αὐτῷ ὁ vΠιλάτος,
Οὐκοῦν βασιλεὺς εἶ σύ; Ἀπεκρίθη wἸησοῦς, Σὺ λέγεις, ὅτι βασιλεύς
εἰμι xἐγώ. Ἐγὼ εἰς τοῦτο γεγέννημαι, καὶ εἰς τοῦτο ἐλήλυθα εἰς τὸν
κόσμον, ἵνα μαρτυρήσω τῇ ἀληθείᾳ. Πᾶς ὁ ὢν ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας ἀκούει
μου τῆς φωνῆς. 38 Λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ yΠιλάτος, Τί ἐστιν ἀλήθεια;

Καὶ τοῦτο εἰπών, πάλιν ἐξῆλθε πρὸς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς, Ἐγὼ οὐδεμίαν zαἰτίαν εὑρίσκω ἐν αὐτῷ. 39 Ἔστι δὲ συνήθεια

Ἑωράκαμεν τὸν Κύριον. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Ἐὰν μὴ ἴδω ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν
αὐτοῦ τὸν τύπον τῶν ἥλων, καὶ βάλω τὸν δάκτυλόν μου εἰς τὸν τύπον
τῶν ἥλων, καὶ βάλω aτὴν χεῖρά μου εἰς τὴν πλευρὰν αὐτοῦ, οὐ μὴ
πιστεύσω.

26 Καὶ μεθ ̓ ἡμέρας ὀκτὼ πάλιν ἦσαν ἔσω οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ Θωμᾶς μετ ̓ αὐτῶν. Ἔρχεται ὁ Ἰησοῦς, τῶν θυρῶν κεκλεισμένων, καὶ ἔστη
εἰς τὸ μέσον καὶ εἶπεν, Εἰρήνη ὑμῖν. 27 Εἶτα λέγει τῷ Θωμᾷ, Φέρε τὸν
δάκτυλόν σου ὧδε, καὶ ἴδε τὰς χεῖράς μου∙ καὶ φέρε τὴν χεῖρά σου, καὶ
βάλε εἰς τὴν πλευράν μου∙ καὶ μὴ γίνου ἄπιστος, ἀλλὰ πιστός. 28 bΚαὶ
ἀπεκρίθη ςΘωμᾶς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Ὁ Κύριός μου καὶ ὁ Θεός μου.
29 Λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ὅτι ἑώρακάς dμε, πεπίστευκας; Μακάριοι οἱ
μὴ ἰδόντες, καὶ πιστεύσαντες.

30 Πολλὰ μὲν οὖν καὶ ἄλλα σημεῖα ἐποίησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐνώπιον τῶν
μαθητῶν eαὐτοῦ, ἃ οὐκ ἔστι γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ. 31 Ταῦτα
δὲ γέγραπται, ἵνα fπιστεύσητε ὅτι gἸησοῦς ἐστιν ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ
Θεοῦ, καὶ ἵνα πιστεύοντες ζωὴν ἔχητε ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ.

21 Μετὰ ταῦτα ἐφανέρωσεν ἑαυτὸν hπάλιν iὁ Ἰησοῦς τοῖς

ϳμαθηταῖς ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς Τιβεριάδος∙ ἐφανέρωσε δὲ οὕτως. 2 Ἦσαν ὁμοῦ Σίμων Πέτρος, καὶ Θωμᾶς ὁ λεγόμενος Δίδυμος, καὶ
Ναθαναὴλ ὁ ἀπὸ Κανᾶ τῆς Γαλιλαίας, καὶ οἱ τοῦ Ζεβεδαίου, καὶ ἄλλοι ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ δύο. 3 Λέγει αὐτοῖς Σίμων Πέτρος, Ὑπάγω
ἁλιεύειν. Λέγουσιν αὐτῷ, Ἐρχόμεθα καὶ ἡμεῖς σὺν σοί. kἘξῆλθον καὶ
lἐνέβησαν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον mεὐθύς, καὶ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ νυκτὶ ἐπίασαν οὐδέν.
4 Πρωΐας δὲ ἤδη nγενομένης ἔστη oὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὸν αἰγιαλόν∙ οὐ
μέντοι ᾔδεισαν οἱ μαθηταὶ ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἐστι. 5 Λέγει οὖν αὐτοῖς pὁ Ἰησοῦς, Παιδία, μή τι προσφάγιον ἔχετε; Ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτῷ, Οὔ. 6 Ὁ
δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, Βάλετε εἰς τὰ δεξιὰ μέρη τοῦ πλοίου τὸ δίκτυον, καὶ
εὑρήσετε. Ἔβαλον οὖν, καὶ οὐκέτι αὐτὸ ἑλκύσαι qἴσχυσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ
πλήθους τῶν ἰχθύων. 7 Λέγει οὖν ὁ μαθητὴς ἐκεῖνος ὃν ἠγάπα ὁ Ἰησοῦς

τῷ Πέτρῳ, Ὁ Κύριός ἐστι. Σίμων οὖν Πέτρος, ἀκούσας ὅτι ὁ Κύριός
ἐστι, τὸν ἐπενδύτην διεζώσατο-ἦν γὰρ γυμνός-καὶ ἔβαλεν ἑαυτὸν
εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν. 8 Οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι μαθηταὶ τῷ πλοιαρίῳ ἦλθον-οὐ γὰρ
ἦσαν μακρὰν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, aἀλλ ̓ ὡς ἀπὸ πηχῶν διακοσίων-σύροντες
τὸ δίκτυον τῶν ἰχθύων.

9 Ὡς οὖν ἀπέβησαν εἰς τὴν γῆν, βλέπουσιν ἀνθρακιὰν κειμένην καὶ
ὀψάριον ἐπικείμενον, καὶ ἄρτον. 10 Λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἐνέγκατε
ἀπὸ τῶν ὀψαρίων ὧν ἐπιάσατε νῦν. 11 bἈνέβη Σίμων Πέτρος, καὶ εἵλκυσε τὸ δίκτυον ςἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, μεστὸν ἰχθύων μεγάλων ἑκατὸν πεντήκοντα τριῶν∙ καὶ τοσούτων ὄντων, οὐκ ἐσχίσθη τὸ δίκτυον. 12 Λέγει
αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Δεῦτε ἀριστήσατε. Οὐδεὶς dδὲ ἐτόλμα τῶν μαθητῶν
ἐξετάσαι αὐτόν, Σὺ τίς εἶ; εἰδότες ὅτι ὁ Κύριός ἐστιν. 13 Ἔρχεται eοὖν
fὁ Ἰησοῦς, καὶ λαμβάνει τὸν ἄρτον, καὶ δίδωσιν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὸ ὀψάριον ὁμοίως. 14 Τοῦτο ἤδη τρίτον ἐφανερώθη gὁ Ἰησοῦς τοῖς μαθηταῖς
hαὐτοῦ, ἐγερθεὶς ἐκ νεκρῶν.

15 Ὅτε οὖν ἠρίστησαν, λέγει τῷ Σίμωνι Πέτρῳ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Σίμων
iἸωνᾶ, ἀγαπᾷς με ϳπλεῖον τούτων; Λέγει αὐτῷ, Ναὶ Κύριε∙ σὺ οἶδας
ὅτι φιλῶ σε. Λέγει αὐτῷ, Βόσκε τὰ ἀρνία μου. 16 Λέγει αὐτῷ πάλιν
δεύτερον, Σίμων kἸωνᾶ, ἀγαπᾷς με; Λέγει αὐτῷ, Ναὶ Κύριε∙ σὺ οἶδας
ὅτι φιλῶ σε. Λέγει αὐτῷ, Ποίμαινε τὰ lπρόβατά μου. 17 Λέγει αὐτῷ τὸ
τρίτον, Σίμων mἸωνᾶ, φιλεῖς με; Ἐλυπήθη ὁ Πέτρος ὅτι εἶπεν αὐτῷ
τὸ τρίτον, Φιλεῖς με; Καὶ nεἶπεν αὐτῷ, Κύριε, oσὺ πάντα οἶδας∙ σὺ
γινώσκεις ὅτι φιλῶ σε. Λέγει αὐτῷ pὁ Ἰησοῦς, Βόσκε τὰ qπρόβατά
μου. 18 Ἀμὴν ἀμὴν λέγω σοι, ὅτε ἦς νεώτερος, ἐζώννυες σεαυτόν, καὶ
περιεπάτεις ὅπου ἤθελες∙ ὅταν δὲ γηράσῃς, ἐκτενεῖς τὰς χεῖράς σου,
καὶ ἄλλος rσε ζώσει, καὶ οἴσει ὅπου οὐ θέλεις. 19 Τοῦτο δὲ εἶπε, σημαίνων ποίῳ θανάτῳ δοξάσει τὸν Θεόν. Καὶ τοῦτο εἰπὼν λέγει αὐτῷ,
Ἀκολούθει μοι.

ἐντειλάμενος τοῖς ἀποστόλοις διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου οὓς ἐξελέξατο,
bἀνελήφθη∙ 3 οἷς καὶ παρέστησεν ἑαυτὸν ζῶντα μετὰ τὸ παθεῖν αὐτὸν
ἐν πολλοῖς τεκμηρίοις, δι ̓ ἡμερῶν ςτεσσαράκοντα ὀπτανόμενος αὐτοῖς,
καὶ λέγων τὰ περὶ τῆς βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ. 4 Καὶ dσυναλιζόμενος παρήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων μὴ χωρίζεσθαι, ἀλλὰ περιμένειν
τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ πατρός, Ἣν ἠκούσατέ μου∙ 5 ὅτι eἸωάννης μὲν
ἐβάπτισεν ὕδατι, ὑμεῖς δὲ fβαπτισθήσεσθε ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ οὐ μετὰ

6 Οἱ μὲν οὖν συνελθόντες gἐπηρώτων αὐτὸν λέγοντες, Κύριε, εἰ ἐν

ὁ προφήτης λέγει τοῦτο; Περὶ ἑαυτοῦ, ἢ περὶ ἑτέρου τινός; 35 Ἀνοίξας
δὲ ὁ Φίλιππος τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τῆς γραφῆς ταύτης,
εὐηγγελίσατο αὐτῷ τὸν Ἰησοῦν.

36 Ὡς δὲ ἐπορεύοντο κατὰ τὴν ὁδόν, ἦλθον ἐπί τι ὕδωρ∙ καί φησιν
ὁ εὐνοῦχος, Ἰδού, ὕδωρ∙ τί κωλύει με ςβαπτισθῆναι; 38 Καὶ ἐκέλευσε
στῆναι τὸ ἅρμα∙ καὶ κατέβησαν ἀμφότεροι εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ, ὅ τε Φίλιππος
καὶ ὁ εὐνοῦχος∙ καὶ ἐβάπτισεν αὐτόν. 39 Ὅτε δὲ ἀνέβησαν ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος, πνεῦμα Κυρίου ἥρπασε τὸν Φίλιππον∙ καὶ οὐκ εἶδεν αὐτὸν οὐκέτι
ὁ εὐνοῦχος, ἐπορεύετο γὰρ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ χαίρων. 40 Φίλιππος δὲ εὑρέθη εἰς Ἄζωτον∙ καὶ διερχόμενος εὐηγγελίζετο τὰς πόλεις πάσας, ἕως

30 Καὶ ὁ Κορνήλιος ἔφη, Ἀπὸ τετάρτης ἡμέρας μέχρι ταύτης τῆς
ὥρας ἤμην bνηστεύων, καὶ τὴν ἐνάτην ὥραν προσευχόμενος ἐν τῷ
οἴκῳ μου∙ καὶ ἰδού, ἀνὴρ ἔστη ἐνώπιόν μου ἐν ἐσθῆτι λαμπρᾷ, 31 καί
φησι, Κορνήλιε, εἰσηκούσθη σου ἡ προσευχή, καὶ αἱ ἐλεημοσύναι σου
ἐμνήσθησαν ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ. 32 Πέμψον οὖν εἰς Ἰόππην, καὶ μετακάλεσαι Σίμωνα ὃς ἐπικαλεῖται Πέτρος∙ οὗτος ξενίζεται ἐν οἰκίᾳ Σίμωνος
βυρσέως παρὰ θάλασσαν∙ ςὃς παραγενόμενος λαλήσει σοι. 33 Ἐξαυτῆς
οὖν ἔπεμψα πρός σε∙ σύ τε καλῶς ἐποίησας παραγενόμενος. Νῦν οὖν
πάντες ἡμεῖς ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ πάρεσμεν ἀκοῦσαι πάντα τὰ προστεταγμένα σοι ὑπὸ τοῦ dΘεοῦ.

34 Ἀνοίξας δὲ Πέτρος τὸ eστόμα εἶπεν, Ἐπ ̓ ἀληθείας καταλαμβάνομαι ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι fπροσωπολήπτης ὁ Θεός∙ 35 ἀλλ ̓ ἐν παντὶ ἔθνει ὁ
φοβούμενος αὐτὸν καὶ ἐργαζόμενος δικαιοσύνην, δεκτὸς αὐτῷ ἐστι.
36 Τὸν λόγον gὃν ἀπέστειλε τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, εὐαγγελιζόμενος εἰρήνην διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ-οὗτός ἐστι πάντων Κύριος- 37 ὑμεῖς οἴδατε,
τὸ γενόμενον ῥῆμα καθ ̓ ὅλης τῆς Ἰουδαίας, hἀρξάμενον ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας, μετὰ τὸ βάπτισμα ὃ ἐκήρυξεν iἸωάννης∙ 38 Ἰησοῦν τὸν ἀπὸ
ϳΝαζαρέτ, ὡς ἔχρισεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεὸς Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ καὶ δυνάμει, ὃς διῆλθεν εὐεργετῶν καὶ ἰώμενος πάντας τοὺς καταδυναστευομένους ὑπὸ
τοῦ διαβόλου, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ἦν μετ ̓ αὐτοῦ. 39 Καὶ ἡμεῖς kἐσμεν μάρτυρες
πάντων ὧν ἐποίησεν ἔν τε τῇ χώρᾳ τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ lἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ∙
ὃν mκαὶ nἀνεῖλον κρεμάσαντες ἐπὶ ξύλου. 40 Τοῦτον ὁ Θεὸς ἤγειρε oτῇ
τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν ἐμφανῆ γενέσθαι, 41 οὐ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ,
ἀλλὰ μάρτυσι τοῖς προκεχειροτονημένοις ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἡμῖν, οἵτινες
συνεφάγομεν καὶ συνεπίομεν αὐτῷ μετὰ τὸ ἀναστῆναι αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν. 42 Καὶ παρήγγειλεν ἡμῖν κηρύξαι τῷ λαῷ, καὶ διαμαρτύρασθαι
ὅτι pαὐτός ἐστιν ὁ ὡρισμένος ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ κριτὴς ζώντων καὶ νεκρῶν.

44 Ἔτι λαλοῦντος τοῦ Πέτρου τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, ἐπέπεσε τὸ Πνεῦμα

Παῦλος, πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, aκαὶ ἀτενίσας bεἰς αὐτὸν 10 εἶπεν,
Ὦ πλήρης παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας, υἱὲ διαβόλου, ἐχθρὲ
πάσης δικαιοσύνης, οὐ παύσῃ διαστρέφων τὰς ὁδοὺς ςΚυρίου τὰς εὐθείας; 11 Καὶ νῦν ἰδού, χεὶρ dΚυρίου ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ἔσῃ τυφλός, μὴ βλέπων
τὸν ἥλιον ἄχρι καιροῦ. Παραχρῆμα eδὲ fἐπέπεσεν ἐπ ̓ αὐτὸν ἀχλὺς καὶ

13 Ἀναχθέντες δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Πάφου οἱ περὶ hτὸν Παῦλον ἦλθον εἰς
Πέργην τῆς Παμφυλίας. iἸωάννης δὲ ἀποχωρήσας ἀπ ̓ αὐτῶν ὑπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα. 14 Αὐτοὶ δὲ διελθόντες ἀπὸ τῆς Πέργης, παρεγένοντο εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν ϳτῆς Πισιδίας, καὶ kεἰσελθόντες εἰς τὴν συναγωγὴν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, ἐκάθισαν. 15 Μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἀνάγνωσιν τοῦ
νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν, ἀπέστειλαν lοἱ ἀρχισυνάγωγοι πρὸς αὐτούς,

λαοῦ oτούτου ἐξελέξατο τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν, καὶ τὸν λαὸν ὕψωσεν ἐν

εἰς aἹερουσαλήμ, bἀπεδέχθησαν ςὑπὸ τῆς ἐκκλησίας καὶ τῶν ἀποστόλων καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, ἀνήγγειλάν τε ὅσα ὁ Θεὸς ἐποίησε μετ ̓
dαὐτῶν. 5 Ἐξανέστησαν δέ τινες τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς αἱρέσεως τῶν Φαρισαίων
πεπιστευκότες, λέγοντες ὅτι Δεῖ περιτέμνειν αὐτούς, παραγγέλλειν τε
τηρεῖν τὸν νόμον eΜωϋσέως.

6 Συνήχθησαν fδὲ οἱ ἀπόστολοι καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἰδεῖν περὶ τοῦ
λόγου τούτου. 7 Πολλῆς δὲ gσυζητήσεως γενομένης, ἀναστὰς Πέτρος
εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς, Ἄνδρες ἀδελφοί, ὑμεῖς ἐπίστασθε ὅτι ἀφ ̓ ἡμερῶν
ἀρχαίων hὁ Θεὸς iἐν ἡμῖν ϳἐξελέξατο, διὰ τοῦ στόματός μου ἀκοῦσαι τὰ
ἔθνη τὸν λόγον τοῦ εὐαγγελίου, καὶ πιστεῦσαι. 8 Καὶ ὁ καρδιογνώστης
Θεὸς ἐμαρτύρησεν αὐτοῖς, δοὺς kαὐτοῖς τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, καθὼς
καὶ ἡμῖν∙ 9 καὶ lοὐδὲν διέκρινε μεταξὺ ἡμῶν τε καὶ αὐτῶν, τῇ πίστει
καθαρίσας τὰς καρδίας αὐτῶν. 10 Νῦν οὖν τί πειράζετε τὸν Θεόν, ἐπιθεῖναι ζυγὸν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον τῶν μαθητῶν, ὃν οὔτε οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν
οὔτε ἡμεῖς ἰσχύσαμεν βαστάσαι; 11 Ἀλλὰ διὰ τῆς χάριτος mτοῦ Κυρίου
Ἰησοῦ πιστεύομεν σωθῆναι, καθ ̓ ὃν τρόπον κἀκεῖνοι.

12 Ἐσίγησε δὲ πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος, καὶ ἤκουον Βαρνάβα καὶ Παύλου
ἐξηγουμένων ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι
δι ̓ αὐτῶν. 13 Μετὰ δὲ τὸ σιγῆσαι αὐτούς, ἀπεκρίθη Ἰάκωβος λέγων,
Ἄνδρες ἀδελφοί, ἀκούσατέ μου∙ 14 Συμεὼν ἐξηγήσατο καθὼς πρῶτον ὁ
Θεὸς ἐπεσκέψατο λαβεῖν ἐξ ἐθνῶν λαὸν nἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ. 15 Καὶ

ςδιελέξατο αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν γραφῶν, 3 διανοίγων καὶ παρατιθέμενος,
ὅτι Τὸν Χριστὸν ἔδει παθεῖν καὶ ἀναστῆναι ἐκ νεκρῶν, καὶ ὅτι Οὗτός
ἐστιν dὁ Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς, ὃν ἐγὼ καταγγέλλω ὑμῖν. 4 Καί τινες ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐπείσθησαν, καὶ προσεκληρώθησαν τῷ Παύλῳ καὶ τῷ Σίλᾳ, τῶν

ᾧ ἦν τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ πονηρόν, bκαὶ κατακυριεύσαν ςαὐτῶν, ἴσχυσε
κατ ̓ αὐτῶν, ὥστε γυμνοὺς καὶ τετραυματισμένους ἐκφυγεῖν ἐκ τοῦ
οἴκου ἐκείνου. 17 Τοῦτο δὲ ἐγένετο dγνωστὸν πᾶσιν Ἰουδαίοις τε
καὶ Ἕλλησι τοῖς κατοικοῦσι τὴν Ἔφεσον, καὶ ἐπέπεσε φόβος ἐπὶ
πάντας αὐτούς, καὶ ἐμεγαλύνετο τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ.
18 Πολλοί τε τῶν πεπιστευκότων ἤρχοντο, ἐξομολογούμενοι, καὶ
ἀναγγέλλοντες τὰς πράξεις αὐτῶν. 19 Ἱκανοὶ δὲ τῶν τὰ περίεργα
πραξάντων συνενέγκαντες τὰς βίβλους κατέκαιον ἐνώπιον πάντων∙
καὶ eσυνεψήφισαν τὰς τιμὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ εὗρον ἀργυρίου μυριάδας
πέντε. 20 Οὕτω κατὰ κράτος fὁ λόγος τοῦ Κυρίου ηὔξανε καὶ ἴσχυεν.

21 Ὡς δὲ ἐπληρώθη ταῦτα, ἔθετο ὁ Παῦλος ἐν τῷ πνεύματι, διελθὼν
τὴν Μακεδονίαν καὶ gἈχαΐαν, πορεύεσθαι εἰς hἹερουσαλήμ, εἰπὼν ὅτι
Μετὰ τὸ γενέσθαι με ἐκεῖ, δεῖ με καὶ Ῥώμην ἰδεῖν. 22 Ἀποστείλας δὲ εἰς
τὴν Μακεδονίαν δύο τῶν διακονούντων αὐτῷ, Τιμόθεον καὶ Ἔραστον,
αὐτὸς ἐπέσχε χρόνον εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν.

23 Ἐγένετο δὲ κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν ἐκεῖνον τάραχος οὐκ ὀλίγος περὶ
τῆς ὁδοῦ. 24 Δημήτριος γάρ τις ὀνόματι, ἀργυροκόπος, ποιῶν ναοὺς
ἀργυροῦς Ἀρτέμιδος, παρείχετο τοῖς τεχνίταις iἐργασίαν οὐκ ὀλίγην∙
25 οὓς συναθροίσας, καὶ τοὺς περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐργάτας, εἶπεν, Ἄνδρες,
ἐπίστασθε ὅτι ἐκ ταύτης τῆς ἐργασίας ἡ εὐπορία ϳἡμῶν ἐστι. 26 Καὶ
θεωρεῖτε καὶ ἀκούετε ὅτι οὐ μόνον Ἐφέσου, ἀλλὰ σχεδὸν πάσης τῆς
Ἀσίας, ὁ Παῦλος οὗτος πείσας μετέστησεν ἱκανὸν ὄχλον, λέγων ὅτι οὐκ
εἰσὶ θεοὶ οἱ διὰ χειρῶν γινόμενοι. 27 Οὐ μόνον δὲ τοῦτο κινδυνεύει ἡμῖν
τὸ μέρος εἰς ἀπελεγμὸν ἐλθεῖν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ τῆς μεγάλης θεᾶς kἱερὸν

17 Γενομένων δὲ ἡμῶν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, ἀσμένως aἐδέξαντο ἡμᾶς οἱ
ἀδελφοί. 18 Τῇ bδὲ ἐπιούσῃ εἰσῄει ὁ Παῦλος σὺν ἡμῖν πρὸς Ἰάκωβον,
πάντες τε παρεγένοντο οἱ πρεσβύτεροι. 19 Καὶ ἀσπασάμενος αὐτούς,
ἐξηγεῖτο καθ ̓ ἓν ἕκαστον ὧν ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι διὰ τῆς
διακονίας αὐτοῦ. 20 Οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες ἐδόξαζον τὸν ςΚύριον, dεἰπόντες
αὐτῷ, Θεωρεῖς, ἀδελφέ, πόσαι μυριάδες εἰσὶν eἸουδαίων τῶν πεπιστευκότων∙ καὶ πάντες ζηλωταὶ τοῦ νόμου ὑπάρχουσι∙ 21 κατηχήθησαν δὲ
περὶ σοῦ, ὅτι ἀποστασίαν διδάσκεις ἀπὸ fΜωϋσέως τοὺς κατὰ τὰ ἔθνη
πάντας Ἰουδαίους, λέγων μὴ περιτέμνειν αὐτοὺς τὰ τέκνα, μηδὲ τοῖς
ἔθεσι περιπατεῖν. 22 Τί οὖν ἐστι; Πάντως gδεῖ πλῆθος συνελθεῖν∙ ἀκούσονται γὰρ ὅτι ἐλήλυθας. 23 Τοῦτο οὖν ποίησον ὅ σοι λέγομεν∙ εἰσὶν
ἡμῖν ἄνδρες τέσσαρες εὐχὴν ἔχοντες hἐφ ̓ ἑαυτῶν∙ 24 τούτους παραλαβὼν ἁγνίσθητι σὺν αὐτοῖς, καὶ δαπάνησον ἐπ ̓ αὐτοῖς, ἵνα iξυρήσωνται

ὑετὸν τὸν ἐφεστῶτα, καὶ διὰ τὸ ψῦχος. 3 Συστρέψαντος δὲ τοῦ Παύλου

κρεμάμενον τὸ θηρίον ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, kἔλεγον πρὸς ἀλλήλους,
Πάντως φονεύς ἐστιν ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος, ὃν διασωθέντα ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης ἡ Δίκη ζῇν οὐκ εἴασεν. 5 Ὁ μὲν οὖν, lἀποτινάξας τὸ θηρίον εἰς τὸ
πῦρ, ἔπαθεν οὐδὲν κακόν. 6 Οἱ δὲ προσεδόκων αὐτὸν μέλλειν πίμπρασθαι ἢ καταπίπτειν ἄφνω νεκρόν∙ ἐπὶ πολὺ δὲ αὐτῶν προσδοκώντων,
καὶ θεωρούντων μηδὲν ἄτοπον εἰς αὐτὸν γινόμενον, mμεταβαλλόμενοι

ἐδόξασαν ἢ ςεὐχαρίστησαν, dἀλλ ̓ ἐματαιώθησαν ἐν τοῖς διαλογισμοῖς
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐσκοτίσθη ἡ ἀσύνετος αὐτῶν καρδία. 22 Φάσκοντες εἶναι

ἐν ὁμοιώματι εἰκόνος φθαρτοῦ ἀνθρώπου καὶ πετεινῶν καὶ τετραπόδων
καὶ ἑρπετῶν.

gἑαυτοῖς∙ 25 οἵτινες μετήλλαξαν τὴν ἀλήθειαν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν τῷ ψεύδει,

ἐστιν εὐλογητὸς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας. Ἀμήν.

26 Διὰ τοῦτο παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς εἰς πάθη ἀτιμίας∙ αἵ τε γὰρ

5 Εἰ δὲ ἡ ἀδικία ἡμῶν Θεοῦ δικαιοσύνην συνίστησι, τί ἐροῦμεν; Μὴ
ἄδικος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἐπιφέρων τὴν ὀργήν;-κατὰ ἄνθρωπον λέγω- 6 Μὴ
γένοιτο∙ ἐπεὶ πῶς κρινεῖ ὁ Θεὸς τὸν κόσμον; 7 Εἰ aγὰρ ἡ ἀλήθεια τοῦ
Θεοῦ ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ ψεύσματι ἐπερίσσευσεν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ, τί ἔτι
κἀγὼ ὡς ἁμαρτωλὸς κρίνομαι; 8 Καὶ μή-καθὼς βλασφημούμεθα, καὶ
καθώς φασί τινες ἡμᾶς λέγειν-ὅτι Ποιήσωμεν τὰ κακὰ ἵνα ἔλθῃ τὰ
ἀγαθά; Ὧν τὸ κρίμα ἔνδικόν ἐστι.

9 Τί οὖν; Προεχόμεθα; Οὐ πάντως∙ προῃτιασάμεθα γὰρ Ἰουδαίους

τε καὶ Ἕλληνας πάντας ὑφ ̓ ἁμαρτίαν εἶναι, 10 καθὼς γέγραπται bὅτι

Οὐκ ἔστι δίκαιος οὐδὲ εἷς∙
οὐκ ἔστιν ςὁ συνιῶν,
οὐκ ἔστιν dὁ ἐκζητῶν τὸν Θεόν∙
πάντες eἐξέκλιναν, ἅμα fἠχρειώθησαν∙
οὐκ ἔστι gποιῶν χρηστότητα,
οὐκ ἔστιν ἕως ἑνός∙
τάφος ἀνεῳγμένος ὁ λάρυγξ αὐτῶν,
ταῖς γλώσσαις αὐτῶν ἐδολιοῦσαν∙
ἰὸς ἀσπίδων ὑπὸ τὰ χείλη αὐτῶν∙
ὧν τὸ στόμα ἀρᾶς καὶ πικρίας γέμει∙
ὀξεῖς οἱ πόδες αὐτῶν ἐκχέαι αἷμα∙
σύντριμμα καὶ ταλαιπωρία ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν,
καὶ ὁδὸν εἰρήνης οὐκ ἔγνωσαν∙
οὐκ ἔστι φόβος Θεοῦ ἀπέναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν.

19 Οἴδαμεν δὲ ὅτι ὅσα ὁ νόμος λέγει, τοῖς ἐν τῷ νόμῳ λαλεῖ, ἵνα
πᾶν στόμα φραγῇ, καὶ ὑπόδικος γένηται πᾶς ὁ κόσμος τῷ Θεῷ∙ 20 διότι
ἐξ ἔργων νόμου οὐ δικαιωθήσεται πᾶσα σὰρξ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ∙ διὰ γὰρ
νόμου ἐπίγνωσις ἁμαρτίας.

21 Νυνὶ δὲ χωρὶς νόμου δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ πεφανέρωται, μαρτυρουμένη ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν∙ 22 δικαιοσύνη δὲ Θεοῦ διὰ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ εἰς πάντας hκαὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς πιστεύοντας∙ οὐ

6 aἜτι γὰρ Χριστός, ὄντων ἡμῶν ἀσθενῶν, κατὰ καιρὸν ὑπὲρ ἀσεβῶν ἀπέθανε. 7 Μόλις γὰρ ὑπὲρ δικαίου τις ἀποθανεῖται∙ ὑπὲρ γὰρ τοῦ

12 Διὰ τοῦτο, ὥσπερ δι ̓ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου ἡ ἁμαρτία εἰς τὸν κόσμον

σιαστήριά σου κατέσκαψαν∙ κἀγὼ ὑπελείφθην μόνος, καὶ ζητοῦσι τὴν
ψυχήν μου. 4 Ἀλλὰ τί λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ χρηματισμός; Κατέλιπον ἐμαυτῷ
ἑπτακισχιλίους ἄνδρας, οἵτινες οὐκ ἔκαμψαν γόνυ τῇ Βάαλ. 5 Οὕτως
οὖν καὶ ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ aλεῖμμα κατ ̓ ἐκλογὴν χάριτος γέγονεν. 6 Εἰ δὲ
χάριτι, οὐκέτι ἐξ ἔργων∙ ἐπεὶ ἡ χάρις οὐκέτι bγίνεται χάρις. ςΕἰ δὲ ἐξ
ἔργων, οὐκέτι ἐστὶ χάρις∙ ἐπεὶ τὸ ἔργον οὐκέτι ἐστὶν ἔργον.

7 Τί οὖν; Ὃ ἐπιζητεῖ Ἰσραήλ, dτοῦτο οὐκ ἐπέτυχεν, ἡ δὲ ἐκλογὴ

ἐπέτυχεν, οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ ἐπωρώθησαν∙ 8 eκαθὼς γέγραπται,

Ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Θεὸς πνεῦμα κατανύξεως,
ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ μὴ βλέπειν,
καὶ ὦτα τοῦ μὴ ἀκούειν,
ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας.

9 Καὶ fΔαυὶδ λέγει,

Γενηθήτω ἡ τράπεζα αὐτῶν εἰς παγίδα καὶ εἰς θήραν,
καὶ εἰς σκάνδαλον, καὶ εἰς ἀνταπόδομα αὐτοῖς∙
σκοτισθήτωσαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν τοῦ μὴ βλέπειν,
καὶ τὸν νῶτον αὐτῶν διὰ παντὸς gσύγκαμψον.

11 Λέγω οὖν, μὴ ἔπταισαν ἵνα πέσωσι; Μὴ γένοιτο∙ ἀλλὰ τῷ αὐτῶν παραπτώματι ἡ σωτηρία τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, εἰς τὸ παραζηλῶσαι αὐτούς.
12 Εἰ δὲ τὸ παράπτωμα αὐτῶν πλοῦτος κόσμου, καὶ τὸ ἥττημα αὐτῶν
πλοῦτος ἐθνῶν, πόσῳ μᾶλλον τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῶν;

13 Ὑμῖν hγὰρ λέγω τοῖς ἔθνεσιν. Ἐφ ̓ ὅσον iμέν εἰμι ἐγὼ ἐθνῶν
ἀπόστολος, τὴν διακονίαν μου δοξάζω∙ 14 εἴ πως παραζηλώσω μου τὴν
σάρκα, καὶ σώσω τινὰς ἐξ αὐτῶν. 15 Εἰ γὰρ ἡ ἀποβολὴ αὐτῶν καταλλαγὴ κόσμου, τίς ἡ ϳπρόσληψις, εἰ μὴ ζωὴ ἐκ νεκρῶν; 16 Εἰ δὲ ἡ ἀπαρχὴ

ἑαυτοῖς ἀλλ ̓ ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ τῷ ἐγείροντι τοὺς νεκρούς∙ 10 ὃς ἐκ τηλικούτου θανάτου bἐρρύσατο ἡμᾶς καὶ ςῥύεται, εἰς ὃν ἠλπίκαμεν ὅτι καὶ ἔτι
ῥύσεται, 11 συνυπουργούντων καὶ ὑμῶν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν τῇ δεήσει, ἵνα ἐκ
πολλῶν προσώπων τὸ εἰς ἡμᾶς χάρισμα διὰ πολλῶν εὐχαριστηθῇ ὑπὲρ
dὑμῶν.

12 Ἡ γὰρ καύχησις ἡμῶν αὕτη ἐστί, τὸ μαρτύριον τῆς συνειδήσεως
ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἐν eἁπλότητι καὶ fεἰλικρινείᾳ gΘεοῦ, hοὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ σαρκικῇ
ἀλλ ̓ ἐν χάριτι Θεοῦ, ἀνεστράφημεν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ, περισσοτέρως δὲ
πρὸς ὑμᾶς. 13 Οὐ γὰρ ἄλλα γράφομεν ὑμῖν, ἀλλ ̓ ἢ ἃ ἀναγινώσκετε ἢ
καὶ ἐπιγινώσκετε, ἐλπίζω δὲ ὅτι iκαὶ ἕως τέλους ἐπιγνώσεσθε∙ 14 καθὼς
καὶ ἐπέγνωτε ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ μέρους, ὅτι καύχημα ὑμῶν ἐσμεν, καθάπερ καὶ
ὑμεῖς ἡμῶν, ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ ϳΚυρίου Ἰησοῦ.

15 Καὶ ταύτῃ τῇ πεποιθήσει ἐβουλόμην kἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς τὸ πρότερον, ἵνα δευτέραν lχάριν mἔχητε∙ 16 καὶ δι ̓ ὑμῶν διελθεῖν εἰς Μακεδονίαν, καὶ πάλιν ἀπὸ Μακεδονίας ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ὑφ ̓ ὑμῶν
προπεμφθῆναι εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν. 17 Τοῦτο οὖν nβουλευόμενος, μήτι ἄρα
τῇ ἐλαφρίᾳ ἐχρησάμην; Ἢ ἃ βουλεύομαι, κατὰ σάρκα βουλεύομαι,
ἵνα ᾖ παρ ̓ ἐμοὶ τὸ Ναί, ναὶ καὶ τὸ Οὔ, οὔ; 18 Πιστὸς δὲ ὁ Θεός, ὅτι
ὁ λόγος ἡμῶν ὁ πρὸς ὑμᾶς οὐκ oἐγένετο Ναὶ καὶ Οὔ. 19 Ὁ pγὰρ τοῦ
Θεοῦ υἱὸς qἸησοῦς Χριστὸς ὁ ἐν ὑμῖν δι ̓ ἡμῶν κηρυχθείς, δι ̓ ἐμοῦ καὶ
Σιλουανοῦ καὶ Τιμοθέου, οὐκ ἐγένετο Ναὶ καὶ Οὔ, ἀλλὰ Ναὶ ἐν αὐτῷ

δοὺς τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ πνεύματος ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν.

πεπλάτυνται. 12 Οὐ στενοχωρεῖσθε ἐν ἡμῖν, στενοχωρεῖσθε δὲ ἐν τοῖς
σπλάγχνοις ὑμῶν. 13 Τὴν δὲ αὐτὴν ἀντιμισθίαν-ὡς τέκνοις λέγωπλατύνθητε καὶ ὑμεῖς.

14 Μὴ aγίνεσθε ἑτεροζυγοῦντες ἀπίστοις∙ τίς γὰρ μετοχὴ δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἀνομίᾳ; bΤίς δὲ κοινωνία φωτὶ πρὸς σκότος; 15 Τίς δὲ συμφώνησις ςΧριστῷ πρὸς dΒελίαρ; Ἢ τίς μερὶς πιστῷ μετὰ ἀπίστου; 16 Τίς

Διό, iἘξέλθετε ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν

ἐσταυρωμένος; 2 Τοῦτο μόνον θέλω μαθεῖν ἀφ ̓ ὑμῶν, ἐξ ἔργων νόμου
τὸ πνεῦμα ἐλάβετε, ἢ ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως; 3 Οὕτως ἀνόητοί ἐστε; Ἐναρξάμενοι πνεύματι, νῦν σαρκὶ ἐπιτελεῖσθε; 4 Τοσαῦτα ἐπάθετε εἰκῇ; Εἴγε
καὶ εἰκῇ. 5 Ὁ οὖν ἐπιχορηγῶν ὑμῖν τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ ἐνεργῶν δυνάμεις ἐν
ὑμῖν, ἐξ ἔργων νόμου, ἢ ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως; 6 Καθὼς Ἀβραὰμ ἐπίστευσε
τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην.

7 Γινώσκετε ἄρα ὅτι οἱ ἐκ πίστεως, οὗτοί aεἰσιν υἱοὶ Ἀβραάμ.
8 Προϊδοῦσα δὲ ἡ γραφὴ ὅτι ἐκ πίστεως δικαιοῖ τὰ ἔθνη ὁ Θεός,

τὰ ἔθνη. 9 Ὥστε οἱ ἐκ πίστεως εὐλογοῦνται σὺν τῷ πιστῷ Ἀβραάμ.

10 Ὅσοι γὰρ ἐξ ἔργων νόμου εἰσίν, ὑπὸ κατάραν εἰσί∙ γέγραπται
ςγάρ, Ἐπικατάρατος πᾶς ὃς οὐκ ἐμμένει dἐν πᾶσι τοῖς γεγραμμένοις
ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοῦ νόμου, τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτά. 11 Ὅτι δὲ ἐν νόμῳ οὐδεὶς
δικαιοῦται παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ, δῆλον∙ ὅτι Ὁ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται∙
12 ὁ δὲ νόμος οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ πίστεως, eἀλλ ̓ Ὁ ποιήσας αὐτὰ fἄνθρωπος

νόμου, γενόμενος ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν κατάρα∙ gγέγραπται γάρ, Ἐπικατάρατος
πᾶς ὁ κρεμάμενος ἐπὶ ξύλου∙ 14 ἵνα εἰς τὰ ἔθνη ἡ εὐλογία τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ
γένηται ἐν hΧριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, ἵνα τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ πνεύματος λάβωμεν διὰ τῆς πίστεως.

διαθήκην οὐδεὶς ἀθετεῖ ἢ ἐπιδιατάσσεται.
iἐρρήθησαν αἱ ἐπαγγελίαι, καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ. Οὐ λέγει, Καὶ
τοῖς σπέρμασιν, ὡς ἐπὶ πολλῶν, ἀλλ ̓ ὡς ἐφ ̓ ἑνός, Καὶ τῷ σπέρματί

ἦμεν νήπιοι, ὑπὸ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου gἦμεν δεδουλωμένοι∙ 4 ὅτε
δὲ ἦλθε τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ χρόνου, ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ,
γενόμενον ἐκ γυναικός, γενόμενον ὑπὸ νόμον, 5 ἵνα τοὺς ὑπὸ νόμον
ἐξαγοράσῃ, ἵνα τὴν υἱοθεσίαν ἀπολάβωμεν. 6 Ὅτι δέ ἐστε υἱοί, ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰς καρδίας hὑμῶν,

ἐκκλησία ὑποτάσσεται τῷ Χριστῷ, οὕτω καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες τοῖς aἰδίοις
ἀνδράσιν ἐν παντί.

25 Οἱ ἄνδρες, ἀγαπᾶτε τὰς γυναῖκας bἑαυτῶν, καθὼς καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς
ἠγάπησε τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, καὶ ἑαυτὸν παρέδωκεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς∙ 26 ἵνα αὐτὴν ἁγιάσῃ, καθαρίσας τῷ λουτρῷ τοῦ ὕδατος ἐν ῥήματι, 27 ἵνα παραστήσῃ ςαὐτὴν ἑαυτῷ ἔνδοξον τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, μὴ ἔχουσαν σπῖλον ἢ
ῥυτίδα ἤ τι τῶν τοιούτων, ἀλλ ̓ ἵνα ᾖ ἁγία καὶ ἄμωμος. 28 Οὕτως ὀφείλουσιν dοἱ ἄνδρες ἀγαπᾷν τὰς ἑαυτῶν γυναῖκας ὡς τὰ ἑαυτῶν σώματα.
Ὁ ἀγαπῶν τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα, ἑαυτὸν ἀγαπᾷ∙ 29 οὐδεὶς γάρ ποτε τὴν
ἑαυτοῦ σάρκα eἐμίσησεν, fἀλλ ̓ ἐκτρέφει καὶ θάλπει αὐτήν, καθὼς καὶ
ὁ gΚύριος τὴν ἐκκλησίαν∙ 30 ὅτι μέλη ἐσμὲν τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ, hἐκ
τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων αὐτοῦ. 31 Ἀντὶ τούτου καταλείψει
ἄνθρωπος τὸν πατέρα iαὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα, καὶ προσκολληθήσεται
ϳπρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν. 32 Τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο μέγα ἐστίν∙ ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω εἰς Χριστὸν καὶ εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν. 33 Πλὴν καὶ ὑμεῖς οἱ καθ ̓ ἕνα, ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα οὕτως
ἀγαπάτω ὡς ἑαυτόν∙ ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἵνα φοβῆται τὸν ἄνδρα.

6 Τὰ τέκνα, ὑπακούετε τοῖς γονεῦσιν ὑμῶν ἐν Κυρίῳ∙ τοῦτο γάρ ἐστι

δίκαιον. 2 Τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα ἥτις ἐστὶν ἐντολὴ

γῆς. 4 Καὶ οἱ πατέρες, μὴ παροργίζετε τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν, kἀλλ ̓ ἐκτρέφετε
αὐτὰ ἐν παιδείᾳ καὶ νουθεσίᾳ Κυρίου.

πάντα ἐζημιώθην, καὶ ἡγοῦμαι σκύβαλα aεἶναι, ἵνα Χριστὸν κερδήσω,
9 καὶ εὑρεθῶ ἐν αὐτῷ, μὴ ἔχων ἐμὴν δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐκ νόμου, ἀλλὰ
τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ, τὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει∙ 10 τοῦ
γνῶναι αὐτὸν καὶ τὴν δύναμιν τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ bτὴν κοινωνίαν τῶν παθημάτων αὐτοῦ, ςσυμμορφούμενος τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτοῦ, 11 εἴ
πως καταντήσω εἰς τὴν ἐξανάστασιν dτῶν νεκρῶν.

12 Οὐχ ὅτι ἤδη ἔλαβον, ἢ ἤδη τετελείωμαι∙ διώκω δέ, εἰ καὶ καταλάβω ἐφ ̓ ᾧ καὶ eκατελήφθην ὑπὸ fτοῦ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ. 13 Ἀδελφοί, ἐγὼ
ἐμαυτὸν gοὐ λογίζομαι κατειληφέναι∙ ἓν δέ, τὰ μὲν ὀπίσω ἐπιλανθανόμενος, τοῖς δὲ ἔμπροσθεν ἐπεκτεινόμενος, 14 κατὰ σκοπὸν διώκω hἐπὶ
τὸ βραβεῖον τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ. 15 Ὅσοι οὖν
τέλειοι, τοῦτο φρονῶμεν∙ καὶ εἴ τι ἑτέρως φρονεῖτε, καὶ τοῦτο ὁ Θεὸς
ὑμῖν ἀποκαλύψει∙ 16 πλὴν εἰς ὃ ἐφθάσαμεν, τῷ αὐτῷ στοιχεῖν iκανόνι,
τὸ αὐτὸ φρονεῖν.

17 ϳΣυμμιμηταί μου kγίνεσθε, ἀδελφοί, καὶ σκοπεῖτε τοὺς οὕτω περιπατοῦντας, καθὼς ἔχετε τύπον ἡμᾶς. 18 Πολλοὶ γὰρ περιπατοῦσιν,
οὓς πολλάκις ἔλεγον ὑμῖν, νῦν δὲ καὶ κλαίων λέγω, τοὺς ἐχθροὺς τοῦ
σταυροῦ τοῦ Χριστοῦ∙ 19 ὧν τὸ τέλος ἀπώλεια, ὧν ὁ θεὸς ἡ κοιλία, καὶ
ἡ δόξα ἐν τῇ αἰσχύνῃ αὐτῶν, οἱ τὰ ἐπίγεια φρονοῦντες. 20 Ἡμῶν γὰρ

4 Χαίρετε ἐν Κυρίῳ πάντοτε∙ πάλιν ἐρῶ, χαίρετε. 5 Τὸ ἐπιεικὲς ὑμῶν
γνωσθήτω πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις. Ὁ Κύριος ἐγγύς. 6 Μηδὲν μεριμνᾶτε, ἀλλ ̓
ἐν παντὶ τῇ προσευχῇ καὶ τῇ δεήσει aμετὰ εὐχαριστίας τὰ αἰτήματα
ὑμῶν γνωριζέσθω πρὸς τὸν Θεόν. 7 Καὶ ἡ εἰρήνη τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡ ὑπερέχουσα πάντα νοῦν, φρουρήσει τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ νοήματα ὑμῶν
ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ.

8 Τὸ λοιπόν, ἀδελφοί, ὅσα ἐστὶν ἀληθῆ, ὅσα σεμνά, ὅσα δίκαια, ὅσα
ἁγνά, ὅσα προσφιλῆ, ὅσα εὔφημα, εἴ τις ἀρετὴ καὶ εἴ τις ἔπαινος, ταῦτα
λογίζεσθε. 9 Ἃ καὶ ἐμάθετε καὶ παρελάβετε καὶ ἠκούσατε καὶ εἴδετε ἐν
ἐμοί, ταῦτα πράσσετε∙ καὶ ὁ Θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης ἔσται μεθ ̓ ὑμῶν.

10 Ἐχάρην δὲ ἐν Κυρίῳ μεγάλως, ὅτι ἤδη ποτὲ ἀνεθάλετε τὸ
ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ φρονεῖν∙ ἐφ ̓ ᾧ καὶ ἐφρονεῖτε, ἠκαιρεῖσθε δέ. 11 Οὐχ ὅτι
καθ ̓ ὑστέρησιν λέγω∙ ἐγὼ γὰρ ἔμαθον, ἐν οἷς εἰμι, αὐτάρκης εἶναι.
12 Οἶδα bκαὶ ταπεινοῦσθαι, οἶδα καὶ περισσεύειν∙ ἐν παντὶ καὶ ἐν
πᾶσι μεμύημαι καὶ χορτάζεσθαι καὶ πεινᾷν, καὶ περισσεύειν καὶ
ὑστερεῖσθαι. 13 Πάντα ἰσχύω ἐν τῷ ἐνδυναμοῦντί με ςΧριστῷ. 14 Πλὴν
καλῶς ἐποιήσατε dσυγκοινωνήσαντές μου τῇ θλίψει.

15 Οἴδατε δὲ καὶ ὑμεῖς, Φιλιππήσιοι, ὅτι ἐν ἀρχῇ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου,
ὅτε ἐξῆλθον ἀπὸ Μακεδονίας, οὐδεμία μοι ἐκκλησία ἐκοινώνησεν εἰς
λόγον δόσεως καὶ eλήψεως, εἰ μὴ ὑμεῖς μόνοι∙ 16 ὅτι καὶ ἐν Θεσσαλονίκῃ καὶ ἅπαξ καὶ δὶς εἰς τὴν χρείαν μοι ἐπέμψατε. 17 Οὐχ ὅτι ἐπιζητῶ
τὸ δόμα, fἀλλ ̓ ἐπιζητῶ τὸν καρπὸν τὸν πλεονάζοντα εἰς λόγον ὑμῶν.
18 Ἀπέχω δὲ πάντα καὶ περισσεύω∙ πεπλήρωμαι, δεξάμενος παρὰ Ἐπαφροδίτου τὰ παρ ̓ ὑμῶν, ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας, θυσίαν δεκτήν, εὐάρεστον τῷ
Θεῷ. 19 Ὁ δὲ Θεός μου πληρώσει πᾶσαν χρείαν ὑμῶν κατὰ gτὸν πλοῦτον αὐτοῦ ἐν δόξῃ, ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ. 20 Τῷ δὲ Θεῷ καὶ πατρὶ ἡμῶν ἡ
δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων. Ἀμήν.

21 Ἀσπάσασθε πάντα ἅγιον ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ. Ἀσπάζονται ὑμᾶς οἱ

ὡς κατὰ ἀνάγκην τὸ ἀγαθόν σου ᾖ, ἀλλὰ κατὰ ἑκούσιον. 15 Τάχα γὰρ

ἠδίκησέ σε ἢ ὀφείλει, τοῦτο ἐμοὶ ςἐλλόγει∙ 19 ἐγὼ Παῦλος ἔγραψα τῇ
ἐμῇ χειρί, ἐγὼ ἀποτίσω∙ ἵνα μὴ λέγω σοι ὅτι καὶ σεαυτόν μοι προσοφείλεις. 20 Ναί, ἀδελφέ, ἐγώ σου ὀναίμην ἐν Κυρίῳ∙ ἀνάπαυσόν μου τὰ

7 Οὗτος γὰρ ὁ Μελχισεδέκ, βασιλεὺς Σαλήμ, ἱερεὺς τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ

ὑψίστου, ὁ συναντήσας Ἀβραὰμ ὑποστρέφοντι ἀπὸ τῆς κοπῆς τῶν
βασιλέων καὶ εὐλογήσας αὐτόν, 2 ᾧ καὶ δεκάτην ἀπὸ πάντων ἐμέρισεν
Ἀβραάμ-πρῶτον μὲν ἑρμηνευόμενος βασιλεὺς δικαιοσύνης, ἔπειτα
δὲ καὶ βασιλεὺς Σαλήμ, ὅ ἐστι βασιλεὺς εἰρήνης∙ 3 ἀπάτωρ, ἀμήτωρ,
ἀγενεαλόγητος, μήτε ἀρχὴν ἡμερῶν μήτε ζωῆς τέλος ἔχων, ἀφωμοιωμένος δὲ τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ Θεοῦ-μένει ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸ διηνεκές.

4 Θεωρεῖτε δὲ πηλίκος οὗτος, ᾧ aκαὶ δεκάτην Ἀβραὰμ ἔδωκεν ἐκ
τῶν ἀκροθινίων ὁ πατριάρχης. 5 Καὶ οἱ μὲν ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν bΛευῒ τὴν
ςἱερατείαν λαμβάνοντες ἐντολὴν ἔχουσιν dἀποδεκατοῦν τὸν λαὸν κατὰ
τὸν νόμον, τοῦτ ̓ ἔστι τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν, καίπερ ἐξεληλυθότας ἐκ
τῆς ὀσφύος Ἀβραάμ∙ 6 ὁ δὲ μὴ γενεαλογούμενος ἐξ αὐτῶν δεδεκάτωκε
eτὸν Ἀβραάμ, καὶ τὸν ἔχοντα τὰς ἐπαγγελίας εὐλόγηκε. 7 Χωρὶς δὲ πάσης ἀντιλογίας, τὸ ἔλαττον ὑπὸ τοῦ κρείττονος εὐλογεῖται. 8 Καὶ ὧδε
μὲν δεκάτας ἀποθνῄσκοντες ἄνθρωποι λαμβάνουσιν∙ ἐκεῖ δέ, μαρτυρούμενος ὅτι ζῇ. 9 Καί, ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν, fδιὰ Ἀβραὰμ καὶ gΛευῒ ὁ δεκάτας λαμβάνων δεδεκάτωται∙ 10 ἔτι γὰρ ἐν τῇ ὀσφύϊ τοῦ πατρὸς ἦν, ὅτε
συνήντησεν αὐτῷ hὁ Μελχισεδέκ.

11 Εἰ μὲν οὖν τελείωσις διὰ τῆς iΛευϊτικῆς ἱερωσύνης ἦν-ὁ λαὸς
γὰρ ἐπ ̓ ϳαὐτῇ νενομοθέτητο-τίς ἔτι χρεία, κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδὲκ ἕτερον ἀνίστασθαι ἱερέα, καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρὼν λέγεσθαι;

γίνεται. 13 Ἐφ ̓ ὃν γὰρ λέγεται ταῦτα, φυλῆς ἑτέρας μετέσχηκεν, ἀφ ̓
ἧς οὐδεὶς προσέσχηκε τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ. 14 Πρόδηλον γὰρ ὅτι ἐξ Ἰούδα
ἀνατέταλκεν ὁ Κύριος ἡμῶν, εἰς ἣν φυλὴν kοὐδὲν περὶ ἱερωσύνης Μωϋσῆς ἐλάλησε.

18 Προσεύχεσθε περὶ ἡμῶν∙ aπεποίθαμεν γὰρ ὅτι καλὴν συνείδησιν
ἔχομεν, ἐν πᾶσι καλῶς θέλοντες ἀναστρέφεσθαι. 19 Περισσοτέρως δὲ
παρακαλῶ τοῦτο ποιῆσαι, ἵνα bτάχιον ἀποκατασταθῶ ὑμῖν.

20 Ὁ δὲ Θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης, ὁ ἀναγαγὼν ἐκ νεκρῶν τὸν ποιμένα τῶν
προβάτων τὸν μέγαν ἐν αἵματι διαθήκης αἰωνίου, τὸν Κύριον ἡμῶν
Ἰησοῦν, 21 καταρτίσαι ὑμᾶς ἐν παντὶ ςἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ εἰς τὸ ποιῆσαι τὸ
θέλημα αὐτοῦ, ποιῶν ἐν dὑμῖν τὸ εὐάρεστον ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, διὰ Ἰησοῦ
Χριστοῦ∙ ᾧ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας eτῶν αἰώνων. Ἀμήν.

22 Παρακαλῶ δὲ ὑμᾶς, ἀδελφοί, ἀνέχεσθε τοῦ λόγου τῆς παρακλήσεως∙ καὶ γὰρ διὰ βραχέων ἐπέστειλα ὑμῖν. 23 Γινώσκετε τὸν fἀδελφὸν
Τιμόθεον ἀπολελυμένον, μεθ ̓ οὗ, ἐὰν gτάχιον ἔρχηται, ὄψομαι ὑμᾶς.
24 Ἀσπάσασθε πάντας τοὺς ἡγουμένους ὑμῶν, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἁγί-

ους. Ἀσπάζονται ὑμᾶς οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰταλίας.

1 Ἰάκωβος, Θεοῦ καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ δοῦλος, ταῖς δώδεκα

φυλαῖς ταῖς ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ, χαίρειν.
2 Πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε, ἀδελφοί μου, ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε ποικίλοις, 3 γινώσκοντες ὅτι τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως κατεργάζεται ὑπομονήν∙ 4 ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ ἔργον τέλειον ἐχέτω, ἵνα ἦτε τέλειοι
καὶ ὁλόκληροι, ἐν μηδενὶ λειπόμενοι. 5 Εἰ δέ τις ὑμῶν λείπεται σοφίας,
αἰτείτω παρὰ τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς, καὶ aοὐκ ὀνειδίζοντος,
καὶ δοθήσεται αὐτῷ. 6 Αἰτείτω δὲ ἐν πίστει, μηδὲν διακρινόμενος∙ ὁ γὰρ
διακρινόμενος ἔοικε κλύδωνι θαλάσσης ἀνεμιζομένῳ καὶ ῥιπιζομένῳ.
7 Μὴ γὰρ οἰέσθω ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος ὅτι bλήψεταί τι παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου.
8 Ἀνὴρ δίψυχος, ἀκατάστατος ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ.

9 Καυχάσθω δὲ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὁ ταπεινὸς ἐν τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ∙ 10 ὁ δὲ
πλούσιος ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ∙ ὅτι ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου παρελεύσεται.
11 Ἀνέτειλε γὰρ ὁ ἥλιος σὺν τῷ καύσωνι, καὶ ἐξήρανε τὸν χόρτον, καὶ τὸ
ἄνθος αὐτοῦ ἐξέπεσε, καὶ ἡ εὐπρέπεια τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο∙
οὕτω καὶ ὁ πλούσιος ἐν ταῖς πορείαις αὐτοῦ μαρανθήσεται.

12 Μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὃς ὑπομένει πειρασμόν∙ ὅτι δόκιμος γενόμενος
ςλήψεται τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς, ὃν ἐπηγγείλατο dὁ Κύριος τοῖς
ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν. 13 Μηδεὶς πειραζόμενος λεγέτω ὅτι Ἀπὸ eΘεοῦ
πειράζομαι∙ ὁ γὰρ Θεὸς ἀπείραστός ἐστι κακῶν, πειράζει δὲ
αὐτὸς οὐδένα∙ 14 ἕκαστος δὲ πειράζεται, ὑπὸ τῆς ἰδίας ἐπιθυμίας
ἐξελκόμενος καὶ δελεαζόμενος. 15 Εἶτα ἡ ἐπιθυμία συλλαβοῦσα τίκτει
ἁμαρτίαν∙ ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία ἀποτελεσθεῖσα ἀποκύει θάνατον.

16 Μὴ πλανᾶσθε, ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοί. 17 Πᾶσα δόσις ἀγαθὴ καὶ
πᾶν δώρημα τέλειον ἄνωθέν ἐστι, καταβαῖνον ἀπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς τῶν φώτων, παρ ̓ ᾧ οὐκ ἔνι παραλλαγή, ἢ τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα. 18 Βουληθεὶς

αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων.

19 aὭστε, ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοί, ἔστω πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ταχὺς εἰς τὸ
ἀκοῦσαι, βραδὺς εἰς τὸ λαλῆσαι, βραδὺς εἰς ὀργήν∙ 20 ὀργὴ γὰρ ἀνδρὸς
δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ bοὐ κατεργάζεται. 21 Διὸ ἀποθέμενοι πᾶσαν ῥυπαρίαν καὶ περισσείαν κακίας, ἐν πρᾳΰτητι δέξασθε τὸν ἔμφυτον λόγον,
τὸν δυνάμενον σῶσαι τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν.

22 Γίνεσθε δὲ ποιηταὶ λόγου, καὶ μὴ ςμόνον ἀκροαταί, παραλογιζόμενοι ἑαυτούς. 23 Ὅτι εἴ τις ἀκροατὴς dλόγου ἐστὶ καὶ οὐ ποιητής,
οὗτος ἔοικεν ἀνδρὶ κατανοοῦντι τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως αὐτοῦ ἐν
ἐσόπτρῳ∙ 24 κατενόησε γὰρ ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἀπελήλυθε, καὶ εὐθέως ἐπελάθετο ὁποῖος ἦν. 25 Ὁ δὲ παρακύψας εἰς νόμον τέλειον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας καὶ παραμείνας, eοὗτος οὐκ ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς γενόμενος
ἀλλὰ ποιητὴς ἔργου, οὗτος μακάριος ἐν τῇ ποιήσει αὐτοῦ ἔσται.

26 Εἴ τις δοκεῖ θρῆσκος εἶναι fἐν ὑμῖν, μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν
gαὐτοῦ, hἀλλὰ ἀπατῶν καρδίαν iαὐτοῦ, τούτου μάταιος ἡ θρησκεία.

πτωχοὺς ςτοῦ κόσμου πλουσίους ἐν πίστει, καὶ κληρονόμους τῆς βασιλείας ἧς ἐπηγγείλατο τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν; 6 Ὑμεῖς δὲ ἠτιμάσατε
τὸν πτωχόν. Οὐχ οἱ πλούσιοι καταδυναστεύουσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια; 7 Οὐκ αὐτοὶ βλασφημοῦσι τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα
τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ ̓ ὑμᾶς; 8 Εἰ μέντοι νόμον τελεῖτε βασιλικόν, κατὰ τὴν
γραφήν, Ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν, καλῶς ποιεῖτε∙ 9 εἰ δὲ
dπροσωποληπτεῖτε, ἁμαρτίαν ἐργάζεσθε, ἐλεγχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου
ὡς παραβάται. 10 Ὅστις γὰρ ὅλον τὸν νόμον eτηρήσει, πταίσει δὲ ἐν
ἑνί, γέγονε πάντων ἔνοχος. 11 Ὁ γὰρ εἰπών, Μὴ fμοιχεύσεις, εἶπε καί,
Μὴ gφονεύσεις∙ εἰ δὲ οὐ hμοιχεύσεις, φονεύσεις δέ, γέγονας παραβάτης νόμου. 12 Οὕτω λαλεῖτε καὶ οὕτω ποιεῖτε, ὡς διὰ νόμου ἐλευθερίας
μέλλοντες κρίνεσθαι. 13 Ἡ γὰρ κρίσις iἀνέλεος τῷ μὴ ποιήσαντι ϳἔλεος∙

καὶ ἡ πίστις, ἐὰν μὴ qἔργα ἔχῃ, νεκρά ἐστι καθ ̓ ἑαυτήν.

δαιμόνια πιστεύουσι, καὶ φρίσσουσι. 20 Θέλεις δὲ γνῶναι, ὦ ἄνθρωπε
κενέ, ὅτι ἡ πίστις χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων aνεκρά ἐστιν; 21 Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ
ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἀνενέγκας Ἰσαὰκ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ
θυσιαστήριον; 22 Βλέπεις ὅτι ἡ πίστις συνήργει τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἐκ τῶν ἔργων ἡ πίστις ἐτελειώθη; 23 Καὶ ἐπληρώθη ἡ γραφὴ ἡ λέγουσα,
Ἐπίστευσε δὲ Ἀβραὰμ τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην,
καὶ φίλος Θεοῦ ἐκλήθη. 24 Ὁρᾶτε bτοίνυν ὅτι ἐξ ἔργων δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος, καὶ οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως μόνον. 25 Ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ Ῥαὰβ ἡ πόρνη
οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ὑποδεξαμένη τοὺς ἀγγέλους, καὶ ἑτέρᾳ ὁδῷ
ἐκβαλοῦσα; 26 Ὥσπερ ςγὰρ τὸ σῶμα χωρὶς πνεύματος νεκρόν ἐστιν,
οὕτω καὶ ἡ πίστις χωρὶς dτῶν ἔργων νεκρά ἐστι.

12 Πρὸ πάντων δέ, ἀδελφοί μου, μὴ ὀμνύετε, μήτε τὸν οὐρανόν,

13 Κακοπαθεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν; Προσευχέσθω. Εὐθυμεῖ τις; Ψαλλέτω.
14 Ἀσθενεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖν; Προσκαλεσάσθω τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς ἐκκλησίας, καὶ προσευξάσθωσαν ἐπ ̓ αὐτόν, ἀλείψαντες nαὐτὸν ἐλαίῳ ἐν τῷ

γινώσκομεν ὅτι ἐγνώκαμεν αὐτόν, ἐὰν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ τηρῶμεν.
4 Ὁ aλέγων, Ἔγνωκα αὐτόν, καὶ τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ μὴ τηρῶν, ψεύστης

ἠκούσατε dἀπ ̓ ἀρχῆς. 8 Πάλιν ἐντολὴν καινὴν γράφω ὑμῖν, ὅ ἐστιν
ἀληθὲς ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν∙ ὅτι ἡ σκοτία παράγεται, καὶ τὸ φῶς τὸ
ἀληθινὸν ἤδη φαίνει. 9 Ὁ λέγων ἐν τῷ φωτὶ εἶναι καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν
αὐτοῦ μισῶν, ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ ἐστὶν ἕως ἄρτι. 10 Ὁ ἀγαπῶν τὸν ἀδελφὸν

περιπατεῖ, καὶ οὐκ οἶδε ποῦ ὑπάγει, ὅτι ἡ σκοτία ἐτύφλωσε τοὺς
ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ.

ἐὰν ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους, ὁ Θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν μένει, καὶ ἡ ἀγάπη αὐτοῦ

13 Ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ μένομεν καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν ἡμῖν,
ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος αὐτοῦ δέδωκεν ἡμῖν. 14 Καὶ ἡμεῖς τεθεάμεθα καὶ

APPENDIX A

CALCULATION OϜ MANUSCRIPT PERCENTAGES

The ςalςulation of manusςript perςentages is not as straightforward
as one might assume. There are four primary faςtors that must be taken
into ςonsideration: (1) the length of the variant unit, (2) whether ςorreςtions and additions by later sςribes are ςounted, (3) how misspellings
and alternate spellings are handled, and (4) how long omissions are
handled. Beςause the manusςript perςentages in this volume are ςalςulated from the ςollations presented in the Text und Textwert volumes,
those volumes guide how these four faςtors are handled in the present
volume. The length of the variant unit is simply the length as presented
in Text und Textwert.1 Correςtions and additions by later sςribes are
ςounted in addition to the original reading of a manusςript. Thus, a
single manusςript ςan be ςounted more than onςe.2 Consequently, it is
more aςςurate to speak of the perςentage of manusςript readings than
the perςentage of manusςripts. When Text und Textwert groups alternate spellings under one variant, they are ςounted as one variant in the
ςalςulation of manusςript perςentages in this volume. Similarly, when

1It should be noted that the length of any given variant unit in Text und Textwert may
sometimes be longer than what is ςited in the footnotes of The Text-Critiςal Greek
New Testament. Ϝor example, the first variant in Mark 2:16 reads as follows:

και οι φαρισαιοι 96.6% ¦ των φαρισαιων CT 0.2%

However, the length of the variant unit in Text und Textwert is aςtually as follows:

αυτω και οι γραμματεις και οι φαρισαιοι ¦ αυτω και οι γραμματεις των φαρισαιων

This differenςe is due to the faςt that some manusςripts have further variations that
are not inςluded in the main text of any of the editions of the Greek New Testament
ςompared in the footnotes presented in this volume. Nevertheless, the perςentages
listed in the footnotes ςorrespond to the variant units as they are presented in Text und
Textwert beςause it provides a truer piςture of the manusςript evidenςe as a whole.
2Perςentages ςalςulated from Tommy Wasserman's ςollation of Jude are based on
Joey MςCollum's tabulations, whiςh take into aςςount only the original text for eaςh
manusςript. The effeςt of this different ςalςulation method on the overall perςentages
is extremely minimal. Apart from this differenςe, the perςentages are ςalςulated in the
same manner as the perςentages based on the Text und Textwert volumes. Perςentages
ςalςulated from MςCollum's tabulations of Wasserman's ςollation are plaςed in braςkets, as are the perςentages ςalςulated from Matthew Solomon's ςollation of Philemon.

APPENDIX A

Text und Textwert groups alternate spellings under separate variants,
they are ςounted as separate variants in the ςalςulation of manusςript
perςentages in this volume. Ϝinally, manusςripts that have long omissions due to faςtors suςh as homoioteleuton are inςluded in the total
number when ςalςulating perςentages.

The proςess of ςalςulation is best illustrated by example. Below is
a summary of the Text und Textwert ςollation for 2 John 9. This variant
unit oςςurs after the words ο μενων εν τη διδαχη (‘whoever abides in
the teaςhing'). The readings are as follows:

Reading

Subtotal

U1

U2

long omission (homoioteleuton)

laςuna

Although the grand total is 569, the manusςripts labeled as X, Y, and Z
are not inςluded in the ςalςulations. This reduςes the total to 513. Thus
the perςentages are as follows:

Reading

Perςentage

89.3% (458/513)

4.5% (23/513)

0.2% (1/513)

U1

U2

0.8% (4/513)

4.9% (25/513)

0.2% (1/513)

In summary, 89.3% of the manusςript readings support the Byzantine
text (Reading 1), while 4.5% of the manusςript readings support the
ςritiςal text (Reading 2).

1 Corinthians 2:1 provides another helpful example. This variant
unit oςςurs after the words καταγγελλων υμιν (‘proςlaiming to you').

plaςed before the words ‘to you')

Although the grand total is 746, the manusςripts labeled as W, X, and
Z are not inςluded in the ςalςulations. This reduςes the total to 597.
Thus the perςentages are as follows:

Reading

Perςentage

93.1% (556/597)

0.3% (2/597)

0.2% (1/597)

0.2% (1/597)

0.5% (3/597)

0.2% (1/597)

1% (6/597)

0.2% (1/597)

In summary, 93.1% of the manusςript readings support the Byzantine
text (Reading 1), while 4.4% of the manusςript readings support NestleAland and Westςott-Hort (Reading 2). (In this ςase SBL and Tyndale
House agree with the Byzantine text.) It should be noted that although
Reading 1B and Reading 3 have the same English translation as Reading 1, it is the perςentage for Reading 1 that is given in the footnote
at 1 Corinthians 2:1. This is beςause the Greek text of Robinson and
Pierpont matςhes Reading 1 and not Reading 1B or Reading 3.

As a rule, manusςripts labeled as U or V are inςluded in the ςalςulations, while manusςripts labeled as W, X, Y, or Z are not. Readings
labeled as 1B, 1C, 1D, 2B, 2C, 2D, etς., are always treated separately.1

1Two exςeptions are 1 Cor. 14:24 and 2 Cor. 11:3 in whiςh the perςentage for Reading
1B is ςombined with the perςentage for Reading 1 sinςe the only differenςe is the
inςlusion or exςlusion of sigma for the word ουτω(ς). Other exςeptions are Mark 16:920, John 5:4, John 7:53-8:11, Romans 14:24-26, and Romans 16:25-27 in whiςh the
totals from different readings are ςombined beςause the differenςes in the readings are

APPENDIX A

The Text und Textwert ςollations for the Gospel of John present
manusςript totals in a peςuliar way that requires additional explanation.
While some readings are labeled 1B, 1C, 1D, 2B, 2C, 2D, etς., other
readings are labeled 1-f or 1-f1, 1-f2, 1-f3, etς. Readings with the -f
label are not presented with a subtotal. Usually (but not always) they
are inςluded in the prior subtotal. Ϝor example, in John 4:37 the first
three readings are listed as follows:

Reading

Text

1-f

ο αληθινος

ο αληθος

ο αληθης

Subtotal

1,333

no subtotal

In this ςase, the aςtual subtotals are as follows:

Reading

Text

1-f

ο αληθινος

ο αληθος

ο αληθης

Subtotal

1,332

In order to be ςonsistent with the ςalςulation methods used with the
other Text und Textwert volumes, the subtotal of 1,332 is what would
be used to ςalςulate the perςentage of manusςripts for Reading 1.

Nevertheless, there are times when the -f label is not inςluded in
the prior subtotal. Reading 13 and Reading 14-f in John 7:40(1) provide a good example. Below is an exaςt representation of the Text und
Textwert data.

based upon the presenςe or absenςe of asterisks or obeli in the margin and other similar
notations or distinςtions.

APPENDIX A

13 OM. των λογων τουτων

030* 106 164 494 516* 1349* 1356 1474 2649*
ANZAHL DER ZEUGEN:1 9

14-f των οχλων λογων

Reading 13 is found in nine manusςripts, whiςh are eaςh listed. The
subtotal is 9 and ςannot therefore inςlude Reading 14-f. Reading 14-f,
whiςh is supported only by manusςript 335, must be given a separate
subtotal of 1 even though no subtotal is listed. The rule of thumb is
that if the label preςeding -f is the same as the prior label, it is inςluded
in the prior subtotal, but if the label preςeding -f is not the same as the
prior label, it is not inςluded in the prior subtotal. Thus in John 4:37
Reading 1-f is inςluded in the subtotal for Reading 1 beςause the label
preςeding -f is the same as the prior label. However, in John 7:40(1)
Reading 14-f is not inςluded in the subtotal for Reading 13 beςause the
label preςeding -f is not the same as the prior label. While -f is the
most ςommon label that is not presented with a subtotal, the same rule
applies for any readings that have a hyphen followed by a lowerςase
letter or lowerςase letters (suςh as -o and -of).

By following the model for ςalςulation desςribed above, anyone
with aςςess to the Text und Textwert volumes should be able to repliςate
the manusςript perςentages found in the footnotes of this volume.2

Additional Perςentages
The Text und Textwert volumes present ςollations for a total of 1,043
variant units. Of those 1,043 variant units, 872 are listed in the footnotes of this volume and 5 are ignored beςause the ςollation data is
inςorreςt. Ϝor the remaining 166 variant units, all the editions of the
Greek New Testament ςompared in this volume are in agreement, and

1That is, "NUMBER OϜ WITNESSES."
2It should be noted, however, that the ςollations for five variant sets (Mark 2:14; 12:25;
Aςts 2:7; 18:21; 27:5) are unreliable, with many manusςripts ςlassified inςorreςtly.

so it is not feasible to present them in the footnotes. Instead, the perςentage for eaςh variant unit is presented below. The mean of these
perςentages is 94%, and the median is 96.4%.

LIST OϜ CORRECTIONS TO CERTAIN EDITIONS
OϜ THE GREEK NEW TESTAMENT

The text-ςritiςal footnotes in this volume have been made on the
basis of the ςorreςtions listed below. The ςorreςtions in ANT and ST
are based on other editions of the same basiς Greek text. Ϝor HϜ the
ςorreςtions in Luke 1:36, John 15:13, John 21:7, Romans 16:1, and
Hebrews 10:17 are based on the faςt that (1) HϜ does not doςument
variants in the apparatus, and (2) these readings have no support among
Byzantine manusςripts. The ςorreςtion in Revelation 9:18 is based on
the apparatus, whiςh indiςates that Ἀπὸ is the intended reading. The
ςhanges in the other verses ςorreςt what are ςlearly typographiςal errors.

WH does not differentiate between ο τι and οτι, always writing the
latter. In this edition the WH rendering οτι has been interpreted as ο τι
in the following verses: Mark 6:23; Luke 10:35; John 2:5; 8:25; 14:13;
15:16; Aςts 9:6; 1 Cor. 16:2; Col. 3:17. The word εννενηκονταεννεα in
editions of the Textus Reςeptus is written as εννενηκοντα εννεα for the
purposes of ςomparison. Robinson and Pierpont spell these two words
as ενενηκοντα εννεα, and so teςhniςally this is a spelling differenςe and
not ϳust a word break differenςe.
