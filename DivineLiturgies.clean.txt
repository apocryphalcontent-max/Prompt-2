FOREWORD

This edition of the Divine Liturgy with propers and commons has been prepared for the use of the
faithful in the Byzantine Ruthenian Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh by the Intereparchial Liturgical Commission and the Intereparchial Music Commission. The text has been translated from the
Greek original, compared with the Church Slavonic.

This new translation seeks to be consistent in rendering biblical and technical terms, faithful to the
vocabulary and thought of the text's original context in the patristic period, but also accessible to a
contemporary American congregation. In a few instances, textual criticism based on the witness of
manuscripts has guided the translation.

In general, translations of biblical quotes and allusions have been guided by The New American
Bible (1970-1991) and by The Psalms (The Grail, 1963). In practice, biblical allusions have usually
required fresh translations both to capture the distinctive readings of the Septuagint Old Testament
and to accommodate the new context of these biblical texts in the Liturgy.

The musical settings are based on the Ruthenian tradition that has been handed down from one
generation to another. After extensive research, discussion, and detailed comparisons of various
written and oral sources, the Intereparchial Music Commission has compiled the plainchant settings
of the Byzantine Liturgy found in this book. The musical renderings of historic scholars have been
carefully adapted to accomodate the new English translation provided by the Intereparchial Liturgical Commission.

This book is approved for use in churches of the Byzantine Metropolitan Church Sui Juris of Pittsburgh, U.S.A., promulgated on the feast of the Theophany of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus
Christ, January 6, 2007. On and after the feast of the Holy and Pre-eminent apostles Peter and Paul,
June 29, 2007, this text and its attendant music will be the sole liturgical text for the celebration of
the Divine Liturgies of our Holy Fathers John Chrysostom and Basil the Great.

Prayers of Preparation
for
The Divine Liturgy

For the Faithful

The Church's book of the Divine Liturgy describes the preparation for the Liturgy by the clergy.
They enter the sanctuary only after saying the appropriate prayers and venerating the icons.
Then they vest and prepare the gifts of bread and wine that are offered in the Divine Liturgy and
that become the Body and Blood of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ.

It is fitting, therefore, that all the faithful prepare themselves for the celebration of this holy
mystery. The following prayers are recommended as a personal preparation.

Through the prayers of our holy fathers, O Lord Jesus Christ our God, have mercy on us.
Amen.

Glory to you, our God, glory to you.

Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of Truth, everywhere present and filling all things, Treasury of
Blessings and Giver of Life, come and dwell within us, cleanse us of all stain, and save our souls, O
gracious One.

 Throughout Pascha, the following is said in place of "Glory to you" and "Heavenly King."

Christ is risen from the dead! By death he trampled Death;
and to those in the tombs he granted life. (Three times)

Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy and Immortal, have mercy on us. (Three times)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

Most Holy Trinity, have mercy on us; Lord, cleanse us of our sins; Master, forgive our transgressions;
Holy One, come to us and heal our infirmities for your name's sake.

Lord, have mercy. (Three times)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those
who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever.
Amen.

Lord, have mercy. (Twelve times)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

Come, let us worship our King and God.
Come, let us worship Christ, our King and God.
Come, let us worship and bow before the only Lord Jesus Christ the King and our God.

 PSALM 22

The Lord is my shepherd;

there is nothing I shall want.
Fresh and green are the pastures
where he gives me repose.

Near restful waters he leads me,
to revive my drooping spirit.
He guides me along the right path;

he is true to his name.

If I should walk in the valley of darkness

no evil would I fear.

You are there with your crook and your staff;

with these you give me comfort.

You have prepared a banquet for me

in the sight of my foes.

My head you have anointed with oil;

my cup is overflowing.

Your mercy, O Lord, shall follow me

all the days of my life.

In the Lord's own house shall I dwell

forever and ever.

PSALM 23

To the Lord belong the earth and its fullness,

the world and all who dwell in it.

It is he who set it on the seas;

on the waters he made it firm.

Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord?
Who shall stand in his holy place?
The man with clean hands and pure heart,
who desires not worthless things,
who has not sworn so as to deceive his neighbor.

He shall receive blessings from the Lord

and reward from the God who saves him.

Such are the men who seek him,

seek the face of the God of Jacob.

O gates, lift high your heads;

grow higher, ancient doors.
Let him enter, the king of glory!

Who is the king of glory?

The Lord, the mighty, the valiant,

the Lord, the valiant in war.

O gates, lift high your heads;

grow higher, ancient doors.
Let him enter, the king of glory!

Who is he, the king of glory?
He, the Lord of armies,

he is the king of glory.

PSALM 115

I trusted even when I said:
"I am sorely afflicted,"
and when I said in my alarm:
"No man can be trusted."

What can I return to the Lord

for all he has given me?

I shall take the chalice of salvation,

and call upon the name of the Lord.

My vows to the Lord I will fulfill

before all his people.

Precious in the eyes of the Lord

is the death of his faithful.

Your servant, Lord, your servant am I;
you have loosened my bonds.

A thanksgiving sacrifice I make;

I shall call on the Lord's name.

My vows to the Lord I will fulfill

before all his people,

in the courts of the house of the Lord,
in your midst, O Jerusalem.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,

now and ever and forever. Amen.

Then three times, with a bow each time:

Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory to you, O God! (Three times)

Lord, have mercy. (Three times)

TROPARIA OF PREPARATION

O Lord, born of the Virgin, do not look upon my sins, but cleanse my heart, and make it a temple for
your most pure Body and precious Blood. Do not cast me away from your presence, for you are
merciful without limit.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

How can I approach and partake of your holy mysteries, for I am unworthy; and if I come to your
wedding feast without the proper garment of worthiness of heart, I would but earn my condemnation.
However, you, O Lord, are able to cleanse my soul and call me to the table of salvation. For you are
the Lover of us all.

Now and ever and forever. Amen.

O Mother of God, great is the number of my sins, but I hasten to you, seeking salvation; visit my
soul in its weakness and pray to your Son our God to grant me the forgiveness of my evil deeds. For
you alone are truly blessed.

TROPARION OF GREAT AND HOLY THURSDAY

While the illustrious disciples were enlightened as their feet were washed at the supper, the ungodly
Judas, darkened by a sick love of silver, betrayed you - the just judge - to lawless judges. See how
a money-hungry man hanged himself because of it; and flee the greedy soul who would do such
things to the Teacher. O Lord, so good to everyone, glory to you!

Lord, have mercy. (Forty times)

1. Prayer of Our Holy Father Basil the Great
 Lord and Master Jesus Christ, my God, source of life and immortality, maker of all things visible
and invisible, coeternal Son of the immortal Father, accept the repentance of me, a sinner. Incline
your ear and hear my prayer: I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned before your face, and I am not
worthy to lift up my eyes to your glory. I have provoked your goodness; I have transgressed your
commandments and disobeyed your statutes. O Lord, be long-suffering with me and show me your
mercy. O you who said through the prophet, "I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he may
repent and live," show me your love and forgive me. Wherefore, even unworthy of heaven and of
earth as I am, I despair not of your salvation. In this life I have wholly yielded myself to sin and
have become the slave of the pleasures of this world. I have defiled your image in me and turned my
back on your loving kindness. When I consider your infinite compassion, I dare to come back to
you, my God and my maker. Receive me, O Christ, as you received the Adulteress; accept me as
you accepted the Prodigal Son, the Publican, and the thief on the cross. Take away the heavy
burden of my sins, O you who take away the sins of the world. You heal human weaknesses and call
to yourself and give rest to those who are weary and heavy-laden.

Cleanse me, O Lord, from every stain of flesh and spirit; teach me to fulfill your will in fear and
holiness that, having the witness of a pure conscience, I may receive my share of your holy things
and may be united to your body and blood. May I have you to abide in me with the Father and the
Holy Spirit. Grant me to receive the bread and wine which are your body and blood until my last
breath and, thereby, to receive fellowship with the Holy Spirit as a provision for the journey to
eternal life, and as an acceptable defense at your dread judgment-seat. Together with all your
saints, may I be a partaker of the good things you have prepared for those who love you, O Lord my
God. Amen.

2. Prayer of Our Venerable Father John Damascene
 Lord and Master Jesus Christ, my God, who alone have power to absolve from sins, forgive all
my transgressions both voluntary and involuntary, committed in word or deed. O loving God,
allow me to partake of your divine, glorious, and pure mysteries. Let my sharing in your body and
blood be for the cleansing of my sins and the healing of my body and a pledge of the life to come
and of your kingdom. You are a merciful God, loving, kind, and full of compassion, and to you I
give glory. Amen.

3. Prayer of Our Holy Father Basil the Great

I know, O Lord, that if I partake unworthily of your pure body and precious blood, I will be
guilty! I will be eating and drinking my own condemnation, not discerning your body and blood.
When I consider your loving kindness, O my Christ and my God, I dare come to you who said,
"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him." Be merciful to me a
sinner, O Lord, and do not rebuke me. Deal with me according to your mercy. Let the bread and
wine be for the healing of my soul and body, for the enlightenment of my mind, and for the protection
of my life. Let them give me confidence in you and love for my brothers and sisters. Let them be
for the amendment of my conduct, for perseverance, for increase in virtue, and for perfection in the
communion of your Holy Spirit. Give me your body and blood, O Lord, as a provision for the
journey to eternal life and for an acceptable defense at your judgment-seat. Do not let them be for
my judgment or condemnation. Amen.

4. Prayer of Our Holy Father Simeon the New Theologian

From defiled lips and from a vile heart, an unclean tongue, and a polluted soul, receive this
prayer, O Christ. Reject not my words, nor my demeanor, nor my persistence. Allow me, my
Christ, to speak boldly of my own desires. Moreover, teach me what you want me to do and say. I
have sinned more than the woman in the city who, knowing where you dined, O Christ my Master
and God, bought ointment and dared to anoint your feet. As you did not reject her whose heart led
her to you, do not despise me, O Word, but allow me also to clasp and embrace your feet and anoint
them with a flood of tears, as with a precious ointment. Wash and purify me with your tears, O
Word. Forgive my trespasses and grant me pardon. You know the multitude of my evil-doings.
You know my wounds and my sores. But you also know my faith. You know what I intend to do
and you hear my sighing. No tear is hidden from you, O God, my maker and deliverer. Your eyes
behold that which I have not yet done, for in your book is written that which has not yet come to
pass. Consider my lowliness. Look upon my affliction and pain. Forgive my every sin, O God of
All, that with a pure heart, a fearful mind, and a contrite spirit, I may partake of your undefiled and
most holy mysteries that bring divine life to all who eat and drink with a pure heart. For you said,
O Master, "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him." True in every
way is the word of my Lord and God. Partaking of deifying grace, I am no longer alone but with
you, my Christ, the Light of the World. Do not allow me to live apart from you, O Giver of Life,
who are my breath, my life, my joy, and the salvation of the world. Therefore, I draw near and you
see my tears and my contrite soul. I beseech you, deliver me from my sins and grant me to partake
without condemnation of your pure and life-creating mysteries, that, according to your word, you
may remain in me, as wretched as I am. For, if I am found fallen from your grace, the tempter may
deceive me and entice me from your deifying precepts. For this reason, bountiful Lord, I fall down
before you and earnestly cry to you: As you accepted the Prodigal Son and the woman in the city
when she came to you, so also receive me, prodigal and vile as I am. Now turning to you with
contrition, O Savior, I know that no one has sinned against you as I have, nor done the things I have
done. Yet I know too that neither the magnitude of the transgression nor the multitude of the sins
surpasses the long-suffering patience of my God and his exceeding love for us. In your merciful

compassion you cleanse and raise up those who earnestly repent, and you make them partakers of
the light and of your divine nature. Strange as it may seem to angels and human reason, you speak
to us as if we are true friends. Inspired with boldness, confident of your rich mercy, O Christ, and
with both rejoicing and trembling, I who am like grass partake of fire, and, amazingly, I am refreshed
and, like the burning bush of old, I am not consumed. Filled with gratitude, I worship, glorify, and
magnify you, my God, for you are blessed, now and ever and forever. Amen.

5. Prayer of Our Holy Father John Chrysostom

O God, absolve, remit, and forgive the transgressions I have committed in thought, word, or
deed, voluntarily and involuntarily. Pardon all my sins, for you are a gracious and loving God.
Allow me to receive your holy body and blood for the good of my soul and the healing of my body;
through the prayers of your most pure Mother, of the spiritual and holy powers of heaven who serve
you in holiness, and of all the saints who have pleased you since time began. Yours is the kingdom
and yours is the glory. Amen.

When you approach for holy communion, you may say in your heart:

Behold, I draw near to divine communion, O Creator; let me not be destroyed. For you are fire to
consume the unworthy. Then rather cleanse me from all that defiles.

The blood that makes divine, O (wo)man, let it be your fear, let it be your dread. It is fire to
consume the unworthy. The divine body makes me a partaker of the divine nature, and likewise
feeds me. It makes the spirit divine and wondrously nourishes the mind.

You have ravished my heart with your love, O Christ; your divine care has converted my soul. Yet,
consume my sins with celestial fire.

Grant me to delight in you. Let me rejoice and exalt your incarnation and your second coming, O
gracious Lord.

How shall I enter, unworthy as I am, into the splendor of your holy place? If I dare to go along into
the bridal chamber my clothing will condemn me, for it is not wedding attire, and I will be bound
and cast out by the angels. Purify my filthy soul, O Lord, and save me, for you love us all.

Loving Master, Lord Jesus Christ, my God, let not these holy gifts be to my judgment, in that I am
unworthy; but rather for the cleansing and hallowing of soul and body and as a pledge of life eternal
and the kingdom. For I hold it good to cling to God; to hope in the Lord for my salvation.

All Catholics who are properly disposed are welcome to receive the Divine Eucharist.
Because Catholics believe that the celebration of the Eucharist is a sign of the reality
of the oneness of faith, life, and worship, members of those churches with whom

Thanksgiving Prayers After Holy Communion

Glory to you, O God. (Three times)

1. Prayer of Our Holy Father Basil the Great

Lord my God, I thank you; for you have not rejected me, a sinner, but have made me worthy to
be a partaker of your holy mysteries. I thank you for allowing me, unworthy as I am, to be a partaker
of your most pure and heavenly gifts. O Lord who love us all, you died and rose for our sake; and
you have given us these awesome and life-creating mysteries for the benefit and sanctification of
our souls and bodies. Grant that they may bring about the healing of my soul and body; the defeat of
every enemy; the enlightenment of the eyes of my heart; the calming of my thoughts and emotions;
a faith that cannot be confounded; a love that does not pretend; a wisdom that overflows; the full
observance of your commandments; the increase of your divine grace; and citizenship in your
kingdom. Being preserved in your holiness by them, I will remember your love at all times. I will
live no longer for myself, but for you, my Lord and Benefactor. Thus, having spent my earthly life
in the hope of life without end, I will attain eternal rest where the sound of rejoicing never ceases,
where the delight of those who gaze upon the beauty of your face cannot be expressed.

For you, Christ our God, are our true desire, and the inexpressible joy of those who love you;

and all creation glorifies you forever. Amen.

2. Prayer of Our Venerable Father John Damascene

God, my God, all-consuming invisible fire, you make your angels flaming fire. In your
inexpressible love, you have condescended to give me your divine flesh. You have allowed me to
partake of your divinity by possessing your most pure body and precious blood. May they penetrate
my entire body and spirit and all my bones. May they burn away my sins, enlighten my soul, and
brighten my understanding. May they sanctify me, making a dwelling-place in me so that I too may
be in you forever, with your blessed Father, and your all-holy Spirit, through the prayers of your
most pure Mother and of all your saints. Amen.

3. Prayer of Our Holy Father John Chrysostom

Christ our God, mystically you have made me worthy to be a partaker of your most pure body
and precious blood. I praise, bless, and worship you; I glorify you and extol your salvation, O Lord,
now and ever and forever. Amen.

4. Prayer to the Most Holy Theotokos

Most holy Lady, Theotokos, light of my darkened soul; my hope, my protection, my refuge, my
comfort, and my joy: I thank you for enabling me, unworthy as I am, to be a partaker of the most
pure body and precious blood of your Son.

You gave birth to the true Light; enlighten the eyes of my heart. You bore the source of
immortality; give life to me who am dead in sin. O compassionate and loving Mother of the merciful

God, have mercy on me; grant me compunction and contrition of heart, humility of mind, and the
recollection of my scattered thoughts. Make me worthy, even until my last breath, to receive the
most pure and sanctifying mysteries without condemnation for the healing of my soul and body.
Give me tears of repentance and confession that I may praise and glorify you all the days of my life;
for you are blessed and glorified forever. Amen.

5. Another Prayer

O Lord Jesus Christ our God, may your holy body bring me everlasting life and may your
precious blood remit my sins. May this Eucharist give me joy, health, and happiness. At your dread
second coming, grant that I, a sinner, may stand at the right side of your glory, through the prayers
of your most pure Mother and of all the saints. Amen.

Psalm 103:

clothed in majesty and glory,

wrapped in light as in a robe.

You stretch out the heavens like a tent.

Above the rains you build your dwelling.

You make the clouds your chariot,

you walk on the wings of the wind;

you make your angels spirits

and your ministers a flaming fire.

You founded the earth on its base,
to stand firm from age to age.

You wrapped it with the ocean like a cloak:

the waters stood higher than the mountains.

At your threat they took to flight;

 at the voice of your thunder they fled.

They rose over the mountains and flowed down

 to the place which you had appointed.

You set limits they might not pass

 lest they return to cover the earth.

You make springs gush forth in the valleys;

 they flow in between the hills.

They give drink to all the beasts of the field;

 the wild asses quench their thirst.

On their banks dwell the birds of heaven;

 from the branches they sing their song.

From your dwelling you water the hills;

 earth drinks its fill of your gift.

You make the grass grow for the cattle

and the plants to serve man's needs,

that he may bring forth bread from the earth

and wine to cheer man's heart;

oil, to make his face shine

and bread to strengthen man's heart.

The trees of the Lord drink their fill,

the cedars he planted on Lebanon;

there the birds build their nests;

on the treetop the stork has her home.

The goats find a home on the mountains
and rabbits hide in the rocks.

You made the moon to mark the months;

 the sun knows the time for its setting.

When you spread the darkness it is night

 and all the beasts of the forest creep forth.

The young lions roar for their prey
 and ask their food from God.

At the rising of the sun they steal away
 and go to rest in their dens.

Man goes out to his work,

 to labor till evening falls.

How many are your works, O Lord!
In wisdom you have made them all.
The earth is full of your riches.

There is the sea, vast and wide,

with its moving swarms past counting,
living things great and small.

The ships are moving there

and the monsters you made to play with.

All of these look to you

to give them their food in due season.

You give it, they gather it up;

you open your hand, they have their fill.

You hide your face, they are dismayed;
you take back your spirit, they die,
returning to the dust from which they came.

You send forth your spirit, they are created;
and you renew the face of the earth.

May the glory of the Lord last forever!
May the Lord rejoice in his works!

He looks on the earth and it trembles;

the mountains send forth smoke at his touch.

I will sing to the Lord all my life,

make music to my God while I live.

May my thoughts be pleasing to him.

I find my joy in the Lord.

Let sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked exist no more.

Bless the Lord, O my soul.

And again:

You made the moon to mark the months;
the sun knows the time for its setting.

How many are your works, O Lord!

In wisdom you have made them all.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,

now and ever and forever. Amen.

Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Glory to you, O God!

Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Glory to you, O God!

Response:

THE LAMP-LIGHTING PSALMS

The faithful STAND for the great incensation of the church.
They may sit when the great incensation is complete.
The opening verses of Psalm 140 with refrain are sung according to the tone of the first sticheron:

Tone 1, page 123
Tone 2, page 128
Tone 3, page 133
Tone 4, page 138

Tone 5, page 143
Tone 6, page 149
Tone 7, page 154
Tone 8, page 159

Psalm 140:

O Lord, I have cried to you, hear me.

Hear me, O Lord!

O Lord, I have cried to you, hear me;
receive the voice of my prayer when I call upon you.

Hear me, O Lord!

Let my prayer ascend to you like incense,
and the lifting up of my hands like an evening sacrifice.

Hear me, O Lord!

The remaining verses are chanted antiphonally:

O Lord, set a guard before my mouth

and set a seal on the door of my lips.

Let not my heart be inclined to evil,

nor make excuse for the sins I commit.

Let me never share in sinners' feasting.

If a just man strikes or reproves me it is kindness

but let the oil of the wicked not anoint my head.
Let my prayer be ever against their malice.

The princes were thrown down by the side of the rock;
then they understood that my words were kind.

As a millstone is shattered to pieces on the ground,

so their bones were strewn at the mouth of the grave.

To you, Lord God, my eyes are turned;
in you I take refuge; spare my soul!

From the trap they have laid for me keep me safe;
keep me from the snares of those who do evil.

Let the wicked fall into the traps they have set

while I pursue my way unharmed.

Psalm 141:

With all my voice I cry to the Lord,

with all my voice I entreat the Lord.

I pour out my trouble before him;

I tell him all my distress while my spirit faints within me.

But you, O Lord, know my path.

On the way where I shall walk they have hidden a snare to entrap me.

Look on my right and see:

there is no one who takes my part.

I have no means of escape,

not one who cares for my soul.

I cry to you, O Lord.

I have said: "You are my refuge, all I have in the land of the living."

Listen, then, to my cry

for I am in the depths of distress.

Rescue me from those who pursue me
for they are stronger than I.

The following versicles continue to be chanted or are sung to melody,
according to the number of stichera:

10. Bring my soul out of this prison

and then I shall praise your name.

9. Around me the just will assemble

because of your goodness to me.

Psalm 129:

8. Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord;

Lord, hear my voice!

7. Let your ears be attentive

to the voice of my pleading.

6.

If you, O Lord, should mark our guilt, Lord, who would survive?
But with you is found forgiveness: for this we revere you.

5. My soul is waiting for the Lord. I count on his word.

My soul is longing for the Lord more than watchman for daybreak.

4. Let the watchman count on daybreak
and Israel on the Lord.

3. Because with the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption,

Israel indeed he will redeem from all its iniquity.

Psalm 116:

2. Praise the Lord, all you nations,
acclaim him all you peoples!

1. Strong is the love of the Lord for us;

he is faithful forever.

The faithful STAND when the holy doors are opened and the cantor sings:

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Dogmatikon or final sticheron is sung while the Little Entrance

your departed servant[s] (Name/s), in a place of light, joy, and peace where there 
is no pain, sorrow, nor mourning. As a good and loving God, forgive every sin 
committed by (him-her-them) in word, deed, or thought, since there is no one who 
lives and does not sin. You alone are without sin; your justice is eternal justice; 
and your word is truth.

For you, O Christ our God, are the resurrection, the life, and the repose of your 
departed servant[s] (Name/s), and we give glory to you, with your eternal Father, 
and your all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now and ever and forever.
